1qakg6m,How do I differentiate real vs anxiety?,"I have been suffering with really bad health anxiety for the past year. It all started last year when I started having these really weird episodes that I believe were a combination of panic attacks and my nervous system being completely shot. After a few months, I was able to recover and was no longer having issues. Recently I have been having some struggles again and I am not sure what to do. I don’t have a regular PCP for one and I also don’t want to feed my health anxiety. However, what I’m experiencing has been debilitating. I know my therapist can help but other than her I feel like I have no one to go to. I’m also terrified of even going to the doc at this point and I feel so stuck.",1768189575.0,3,2,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
1qajjnx,Tips for learning how to drive with health anxiety?,"Hey Everyone! I'm currently 21 and trying to find the courage to finally learn how to drive, but after some reflection, realize my anxieties are holding me back from pushing towards that goal.

1qagche,New to HA,"I’m new to health anxiety and trying to understand what I’m experiencing. A health scare a couple of months ago triggered a lot of fear, and even though I’ve been medically reassured, I’ve felt mentally and emotionally checked out since then. It’s been really hard because this time of year is usually my favorite, and I’m about to turn 25 but don’t feel present or like myself.

Lately, my anxiety keeps shifting focus, once one worry calms down, my brain finds something else to fixate on. I feel stuck in a cycle of reassurance-seeking, doubting medical reassurance, and constantly scanning my body. Preventative care appointments, which I know are routine and important, feel overwhelming instead of reassuring.

What’s been hardest is feeling alone in this. I don’t have much family support around health topics, and I feel like others around me don’t really understand how consuming this anxiety can be. I’m struggling to break out of this loop and would really appreciate hearing from others who’ve experienced something similar or found ways to manage this pattern.",1768178468.0,12,14,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

I have pretty terrible health anxiety and was just sick after Thanksgiving from someone who came to our party sick. I plan to wear a mask (I bought the n95) and I use hand sanitizer religiously. I have work Thursday and Friday from home, a dentist appointment Friday that I can’t miss, and then I have maybe 4 errands to run during wedding week. I plan to wear a mask for all of it!

I really need some advice and guidance as I can’t go on like this. (Just to clarify - it’s not stomach anxiety in the normal sense where anxiety gives you a bad stomach - my stomach is fine I am just TERRIFIED of HAVING a bad stomach when I’m out in public and I won’t cope, so I guess it’s anticipatory anxiety) I’m struggling to to find any info anywhere about my problem - all I can find is anxiety giving you a bad stomach, but that’s not my problem. It’s become a really bad obsession - I have to get back on a 40 min bus ride tomorrow each way 4 days a week and right now, I don’t know how I will do that. I’m anxious to walk down the road right now. I’ve become obsessed with what food I eat and whether that will upset my stomach. All day everyday I am waiting for something to happen with my stomach. I can barely go out anymore, I really am stuck with what to do. This has to change - I have to be out on a bus 4 days a week. If anyone has any tools or tips to help with this I’d be really grateful. 🙏🏻 thanks ",1768142295.0,7,5,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

One of the things that has calmed me over the years is knowing how rare that is. I read the stats. Although I take birth control and vape, it is still very rare in my mid 20s. Because of that reframe, I’ve felt a bit better. 

However, someone I was once friends with and is my age, just had one and died. That rarity factor feels gone. I really don’t mean to make it about myself, I just want tips and help. Because now I know it’s more than possible to happen to me. ",1768110589.0,29,10,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
1q9njex,any tips?,"there’s a lot of flares i coulda put for this so bare with me

i had a car accident in late august 2025, my car flipped completely over and my life did, in fact, flash before my eyes.

i had a lot of anxiety before that, but until i got that close to death i had never had fear of dying or my health declining. ever since then, i’ve been constantly anxious, constantly aware, constantly finding things that could be wrong with me (fibromyalgia, tumors, ulcerative colitis, chs, pretty much anything that is deadly, i’ve probably thought i had it). though, almost everyone tells me i can chalk a lot of my “symptoms” up to not eating enough and having weird eating patterns. 

best part is, its usually the thought i could possibly develop it that really gets me. i’m so quick to change the way i do things because i don’t want to get sick.

i just was wondering if anyone has any tips. anything that might help! the people in my life try but they don’t exactly understand what it feels like. i just want tips to make my everyday easier, i want to stop being on edge.",1768099109.0,5,0,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

1q9k32b,Just wondering if others experience something similar,"I don't have anxiety about anything in particular. I'm not concerned that a minor ailment means I have something awful. However, when I have to go to the doctor for something as seemingly minor as a sprained wrist, my anxiety in the last few years has gone through the roof. I got a call this morning to make an appointment to go back to the doctor about some tests. Now I'm absolutely freaked even though I have no clue what the issue is.



I know I am way overweight and that has already been raised so maybe it's a bit of ""it's your own fault"". It's like I used to pride myself on being healthy, and now I'm just terrified there will be something ""wrong"". Ugh. (I'm just over 60 so no spring chicken) Anyway, since getting the call today to make an appt. I've hardly eaten and just am a ball of anxiety.

1q9jkip,It’s more nuanced than that.,"I recently saw a post on here that said something along the lines of “Trust your doctor, not google” and I saw a lot of replies under it disagreeing and maybe 1 or 2 agreeing.

I just wanted to say, it’s more nuanced than that.

Yes, some people don’t have access to good doctors, many don’t even have access to \*a\* doctor let alone a good one. But the fact is, google is not a doctor, google does not have your health record, and there is \*ways\* to discuss your concerns and symptoms with medical professionals that doesn’t let google or the doctor win but rather lets you get properly diagnosed and treated.

I’m speaking from a place of experience with several dismissive and rude doctors, sometimes ignorant doctors who don’t even know the medical jargon I spew when I’m anxious. But I have been able to find ways to communicate how I’m feeling and why I think I’m feeling that way.

It’s useful to have an advocate if you cannot convince a doctor on your own, bring someone who lives with you and can vouch for your fears. If you can’t do that, I find a gentle but firm tone when discussing your fears helps them understand why you feel the way you feel and what you think would actually help. Personally I’ve found being very blunt helps sometimes as well, “I am here to get diagnosed and treated for my symptoms as a patient, not to get told what I feel as a human being” has helped me personally.   

You don’t have to rely one or the other, there’s ways to do both, use google as a tool to help narrow down issues if you must and discuss those issues with your doctor instead of blindly trusting one or the other. It’s a delicate balance but one I truly believe anyone can strike.",1768088700.0,1,0,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

I wonder if I’m at risk of that thing. I start obsessively researching the thing. I find the person’s Instagram and start scrolling to see if we share similar lifestyles, habits and risk factors. I’ve been going down the rabbit hole of the thing on and off for nearly 24 hours. 

 Even though I have no signs of this thing, I’m now obsessed, terrified and convinced that I very well could get this thing at some point.

1q89z8s,Doctors on social media fear mongering,"I have health anxiety due to my family history with heart disease and my own relatively poor diet over the years. I’m trying to improve it bit by bit. I do fail at times but I’m trying to keep at it. I have had bad health anxiety over the last couple of years even landing up in the hospital due to a panic attack. The first time it happened I legit thought I was dying.

Now, the thing is every time I log onto to social media (X, Insta) there are threads or clips by all these doctors who try to be overly dramatic for engagement or whatever it is they want. They’ll take an extreme case of someone seeming healthy dropping dead and project it to the entire population and say that everyone is at risk. Given my history and current mental health, I start imagining these scenarios happening to me and it makes my anxiety worse.

1q74vak,"Developed lingering anxiety after basically being fearmongered into thinking I have an issue that wasn't there, and I haven't been the same since.","Hi, I actually was in the Anxiety Help subreddit too since I saw some people posting about asking for medical advice, so I thought I'd share my worries there instead of bothering the original forum where I assumed I have an issue. But it was probably way too [long ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1q6u41u/comment/nyaf8hq/)for people to bother, which is understandable, even if that just leaves me reeling for a whole day. 

I'm not sure how far I'll go since from the looks of posters any mention of symptoms gets me removed, so I will do my best to be vague. Or please feel free to click into my profile or the link to provided for the full context. There's a lot. 

But regardless: exactly as the title says, I was more or less heavily convinced into believing I was subjected to a reaction of my own making because I didn't look after my environment enough. It turned out to be nothing, but the residual anxiety never fully faded. Things that I see with my own two eyes and process as should not be a problem or were previously not worth noting, are now still receiving repeated scrutiny even though logic dictates it's nothing. Then when I finally start to feel a bit better... something that appears to be of actual concern comes up again, and when I manage to tell myself it's an isolated incident, I've already tricked myself into believing the symptoms have expanded which fuels the anxiety all over. 

It's vexing, I finally get the rare opportunity to unwind this month but something gets in the way and I can't properly relax. I don't think simply dismissing the worries as anxiety is possible, no matter how many people tell me that's what it is, so I would like anyone who has dealt with the feeling longer than me to impart what you do to feel better.

1q3wli3,Anxiety of Anticipation,"So, I’ve been dealing with HA since 2019. It’s never truly gone away, I’ve just gotten better at suppressing it usually with unhealthy habits (e.g. alcohol), but I’ve been working this past year or so on replacing with healthier habits. I had this thought the other day: how much of my HA is driven by the anticipation of unusual symptoms rather than symptoms themselves? That’s not to say that new sensations don’t appear. But I’m constantly anticipating that they will, and inevitably when they do (because that’s just part of being human) I’m like “ah, there it is, that’s what I’ve been waiting
to see” and the anxiety spiral is set-off from there. I guess the crux of this is that HA also exists simply in the anticipation of unusual symptoms not just when sensations appear. 
Another thought I had that helped me recently: What would my life look like if I was just a normal healthy person? I imagine it would
look exactly the same as it does now (minus the anxiety).

1q356wx,Learning to tell the difference between anxiety signals and real red flags,"One approach that’s been discussed in anxiety management is shifting away from reassurance-seeking and toward learning how clinicians think about urgency and red flags.

Instead of repeatedly checking or searching for confirmation, this focuses on:

* recognizing signs that typically require immediate medical evaluation
* understanding which sensations are commonly associated with anxiety
* using structured information to guide next steps

- Avoid google 
- be careful with reddit 
- focus on the facts not the what ifs 
- write the facts you know on a paper and read it when you are panicking 
- calm breathing 
- gym
- prayer
- meditation

The average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**

This means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.

* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where ""marinating in the positive"" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).
* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.
* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).
* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.
* Declaration of living life in the ""here and now"", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.
* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: ""being perfect"" vs ""being good enough"").

**REGARDING ""journey updates"" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the ""update post"" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post.

I hope this post is allowed here. Sadly I lost my baby a little over 3 months ago due to a very rare genetic disorder. I was about 14 weeks pregnant.

I was diagnosed with GAD at 13 years old and have always been somewhat of a hypochondriac, but it has been manageable. Unfortunately ever since my loss, my health anxiety has skyrocketed to where I think there is most definitely something wrong with me. Some of the symptoms I experience are reoccurring while others are new. I have been seen by my PCP several times within the last couple of months. I am seeing a psychiatrist and am in the process of looking for a new therapist. I will admit that I am out of shape and need to get back to an exercise routine which used to help with my mental health. It’s so hard to get back there though when you’re back to square one. 

When I was pregnant, my health anxiety shifted to my baby so I was concerned less about myself (to my relief). But now it’s all coming back full throttle and I am exhausted.

Ill share something that DID help me - it was kinda a flipped switch moment. A few years ago i tried betterhelp (this isnt a plug) for a few months and while it wasnt really all that helpful for me in the long run the therapist i had did say something that really stuck with me. I was describing to them a dinner I was having at a friends house and how i was hyper focused on watching every little detail of the food being prepared..so much so that I could barely keep involved in the conversation, it was all consuming. To this they asked a really simple question: ""What do you think would happen, even in the worst case scenario?"" 

i tried to rationalize my anxiety to them by saying ""well what if some plastic fell into the skillet"" or ""what if the cooking utensils still had dishwasher detergent on them""  to which they replied ""Well first of all did any of those things happen, and even if they did, whats the worst that could happen? The human body is extremely resilient"" This made me realize that Ive gone my entire life surrounded by these things, everyone does, and im still here and im still fine.

The test itself isn't the true cause, in my opinion.  
It's what the brain anticipates from the exam.  
  
Health anxiety is more about certainty than illness.  
Uncertainty is not eliminated when a test yields normal results.  
What if it was missed? only serves to advance it.  
What happens if it changes?

my health anxiety has been acting up again ever since a week ago, and i don’t really know why. yesterday i went to my GP practice, and i think the GP made my health anxiety worse by dismissing it and making fun of it kinda.. afterwards i saw that she was trying to take me seriously and had empathy, but overall i didn’t really feel understood. i’ve felt like that ever since i’ve been a patient at their practice, aka 2023. 

that’s why i’ve been wanting to change GP’s, but i’m not sure if that would be a good idea, because i’m afraid it’s my health anxiety talking instead of my rational thoughts? what do you think? should i change my GP? it’s also shitty that most of them have ‘patient stops’ here because of COVID.. literally fuck COVID

 But something interesting I noticed over the last couple years things seem to have gotten harder and harder to calm myself down during an episode. It really wreck my day (often several days)
And I have been going over changes in my life that may help me understand why things are harder to manage then in past. In order of probable relevance which may or may not resonate with others who notice a fluctuation in their own health anxiety

Prior to the last few years at least, my depression was pretty intense and I could shrug things off because I cared less about my life. It really does seem the more I care about living the more I worry about it too.

Also I have recently been essentially semi retired, giving me too much time and not as many distractions to help. Full time work is surprisingly helpful distraction.

I got a dog for first time and not only do I worry about me but also him. He the bestest boy ever, and bring me so much joy but I also worry about him and myself more. He has very bad separation anxiety and I fear leaving him behind.

Recently got diagnosed with ADHD and treatment of that seems to have also been a factor. Apparently it may help with anxiety related to ADHD but other forms of anxiety can be amped up.

It's been interesting reflecting on how health anxiety can be affected by changes in your life. And now that I finally made these connections I can work on moving forward. Though gotta figure the specifics of that out.

Goes to show even when you think you have it handled sometimes you need to do more and it's a continuous journey. Though I wish I didn't have this struggle as it feels like so much time is wasted managing things.

Maybe my own self insights can help someone else who finds themselves struggling a little more then they used to.

1pntxr2,Back to normal rules and reactivated filters,"Hello there

The one week experiment of no filters and no rule 1,2 and 4 is over. Initial post is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/1pi97sa/no\_automated\_filters\_for\_a\_week/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/1pi97sa/no_automated_filters_for_a_week/)

Lessons learned:

* People post a lot of symptoms
* People ask specific medical advice in regards to blood work or medication
* People ask a lot for reassurance and sometimes just want to vent
* There were few posts being made during that time that didn't break rules 1,2 and 4 and wouldn't trip our filters. A good example is this post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/1pn46kd/what\_age\_did\_you\_devlop\_health\_anxiety\_and\_was\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/1pn46kd/what_age_did_you_devlop_health_anxiety_and_was_it/)
* Posts that broke rule 1,2 or 4 were being reported (thank you for still looking out for the sub, whoever you are!)
* Engagement with posts is slightly more than with comments in the megathread. That could also be because we have a default sorting of ""New"" in the megathread comments and not ""Best"" like with posts. We will look into how to optimize our megathreads for more engagement with/in comments.
* Our automated filters do a good job of reducing the number of posts that would break rules 1,2 and 4 while still letting through posts that don't (without the need of manual mod approval).
* We could go through the mod log and have a look at posts that were automatically removed by the automoderator. This would require a lot more time and more mods. If you feel you can help out with moderation, please apply here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/application/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/application/)

If you want to see a snapshot of the subreddit home page, you can look at this archive: [https://archive.is/yP4yK](https://archive.is/yP4yK)

We will be going back retroactively and removing posts that clearly violate rules 1,2 and 4 so that browsing the subreddit normally isn't triggering and that medical and symptom commenting isn't happening outside the megathread.

1pmb6sw,My mother has really bad health anxiety and sometimes I get terrified of it too,"So my mother has always been someone mentally strong minded and someone who never really seemed to care about health issues that much but it changed since last year my grandmother had  paralysis attack which has been a bit of a traumatic experience to us cuz we had never really seen anything like that happening in front of us. Since then she's been having bad anxiety issues which soon turned into health anxiety and her checking her bp many times a day and doubting about her heart working properly or not. In the April her bp increased midnight she was sleeping and things happened she woke up terrified and told us her left side was feeling numb we got her checked and a few tests done like CT scan ecg and blood reports. Everything was very normal and she was told that she had GERD then I studied somewhere that gerd or acid reflux may mix up with anxiety and sometimes causes palpitations in bp. She has had really bad time with her gerd that also caused her numbness in hands or feets too sometimes and whenever she checked her bp at that time it came out a bit higher than usual otherwise her bp stays very normal like 110/65 or 120/80 and her pulse also always showed up around 70. A few days back she has had the same bp thing happened to her in midnight but it came down back normal pretty soon. This time she got ecg done again but this time very mild palpitations showed up which I asked a few doctors and they said the ecg was normal or someone said the ecg shows that there was alot of sound and movement around when the ecg was happening or something like that I don't remember clearly but overall they said it was good. But these days the digital bp machine shows her pulse to be 62-64 sometimes 70 due to which she overthinks alot again. She also have chest pains and pain in sides or maybe going to the back too but they get normal really quick after taking digestive enzymes or the capsules.
But her having this much anxiety causes me anxiety too and I get really bad thoughts sometimes which I don't really show to her because it will only make her overthink more. Also she stays pretty normal when her mind is diverted watching tv doing stuff that makes her happy and all.
I wanted to know if these things are normal in GERD ?

I've mainly said nothing because any time I've questioned his googling or chatgpt he's annoyed. The other night he was talking to me about using chatgpt and calling it ""he"". English is not his first language so I'm not sure if maybe it was just accidental because his mother tongue is gendered however I find it unlikely because he's very good in english (I don't really hear him make mistakes like that).

However, I partially agree that I should be more sensitive when I use specific medical term, but disagree at the same time about 'not using the old term'. Moreover, I'm not sure why is it wrong to say the old term to describe 'my own symptoms'.

I can’t live like this too, it’s become so limiting. It sounds so silly I’m embarrassed but it is what it is.

My story started when I was 19. I had an injury caused by trauma, so I went to the doctor and he recommended surgery. I also needed an MRI. Long story short, I had no knowledge about gadolinium and the injection was given to me without having me sign a consent form (I filed a complaint afterward).

After that, I went through a difficult period with more than 10 symptoms and several ER visits. It was a really tough time for me, but eventually I recovered and returned to my career.

However, I still can’t forget what happened — it’s always on my mind, and I’ve been having nightmares. I disconnected from everything around me, and sometimes life just feels very dark. I'm like a living dead.

1pjayu6,CSF headache,"I just spent 5 days constantly ruminating & tormenting myself, believing I have a CSF leak that’s causing a headache.. because I had sneezed & blown my nose really hard the week before. My head hurt for 5 days straight. And I spent the entire 5 days trying to figure out what was wrong with my brain. 

I really thought I was gonna die. It hurt so bad. Like a water balloon was in my brain. The headache felt better when I laid down, most of the time. It fit into the criteria of a “positional” headache. Anytime I moved, it felt like the “water” in the “water balloon” moved around with my head. So much pressure, throbbing. My ears were ringing, & I’ve never had tinnitus before. My right eye hurt. It was mostly on my right side. It fluctuated, got a little better at some points, then worse again. At one time, I felt like my pupils were dilated. I felt dizzy when I got out of the shower one day. One day, I went down a “migrane” rabbit hole.. which is a whole nother topic. One day I thought it was severe dehydration. High blood pressure, low blood pressure. Etc. I was miserable & terrified. And the pain was so bad.

I went to the dr yesterday, & he said my sinuses weren’t infected, but I had a little fluid in my ears (tinnitus). And he said we would treat it like sinus pressure, & if my head still hurt in 2 days, to come back & do “scans.” I obviously thought that was bullshit, but part of me started questioning myself. I started to remember I have health anxiety & doubt everything..

I (27F) ended up taking 1 Sudafed the dr perscribed me.. within 30 minutes, 5 days of pressure & pain, was gone.

I live in the south, and apparently it’s extremely common for most people here to get sinus pressure at this time of year. When the weather is going from hot, cold, hot, cold. I’d just never experienced any sinus issues or allergies or anything before. I’ve had sinus infections, but no headaches. I don’t usually have any headaches, which I’ll never take for granted again.

In my defense (lol), again, I’ve never had sinus issues before, and my congestion from 2 weeks before had “went away” already (it got pushed up & blocked in my sinuses, so my nose wasn’t running or anything). So I didn’t ever even think about my sinuses.
Since yesterday, soo many of my coworkers & family have basically been like “oh.. duh. yeah, that’s normal.” Atleast where we live.

The point is: Maybe, maybe, you just have sinus pressure.
That’s a possibility.

I made this post because I wish I would have found a post like this during the past 5 days.

Health anxiety is the WORST.
Sudafed & Claritin are miracles.
I’ll never blow my nose or cough super hard on purpose again.

1pil4l8,Anxiety about fit test and Bowel/C,"hi! hoping to reassure myself here instead of asking my long suffering partner…

so I did a fit test this week. I have an ongoing anal fissure and constipation since giving birth 2 years ago. I asked the gp for a referral for the fissure, it just keeps reopening thanks to the constipation, I’ve tried all the usual creams etc for this. since my constipation is persistent and my health anxiety is telling me loudly ive definitely got bowel c\*\*\*\*\*, I asked my gp if I could do a fit test and he agreed, ive got an appointment for bloods to check iron this week too.

just got my result, 4 - great! below 10 so ‘negative’. circa 1 min of relief. here’s where my brain fires up… the poo I used to take the sample was small, round, hard - constipated. what if it wasn't a good enough sample and it’s a false negative! and I really do have c\*\*\*\*\*. cue googling statistics for false negatives etc. 

argh, has anyone anecdotally used hard poo for a fit test? honestly, what is my brain. 

i highly suspect my ferritin will be super low in the bloods (it was only 13 this summer), so maybe I’ll end up getting referred for a colonoscopy anyway. siiiigh. ",1765318748.0,0,4,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
1piitfw,Feel like my body has been falling apart the past two years and nobody is taking me seriously.,"Trigger warning for neurological disorders, particularly MS and ALS-

  
I have a strong family history of MS- Both my father and his sister have it, and they were both diagnosed around the same age I am now. My father has it very, very badly. He can't do anything on his own anymore and is in the hospital with new complications several times a year. Growing up watching his condition progress has given me a huge amount of trauma and anxiety over the illness, and it has been my number one fear for as long as I can remember.

  
Starting about two years ago, I began having minor symptoms. Weird little flashes in my vision and a tingle on my back that would come and go. Fast forward a few months, and I saw an MS specialist and got an MRI done. The specialist wasn't concerned as I passed all of her physical tests, and the MRI was clean.

  
Fast forward a year after that and my symptoms have become so much worse. I get random tingling/tickling weakness in random parts of my body that come and go on a daily basis. One day its my arm, another its my leg. My vision has gotten noticeably worse. I'm stumbling a bit when I walk. Today, the weakness is in my left arm and I'm having more trouble typing this than I usually would.

  
I got ANOTHER MRI six months ago- also clean. Nobody is concerned. Everyone is chalking it up to anxiety, or potentially something nerve-damage related. My family and therapist are trying to talk me out of a lumbar puncture because they don't want me to start going down the rabbit hole of invasive testing. I know they're all sick of me talking about this. It's absolutely an obsession at this point, but it's 100% real and nobody understands. For the record, I have OCD and PTSD.

  
I feel like with the family history, the symptoms I'm experiencing, and the age I'm at, there is literally nothing else this could be. I'm getting so frustrated, because to \*ME\* it feels very obvious that I have MS, but nobody else seems to think so.

  
How do I even deal with this stress? Obviously, I don't want to be diagnosed with this disease that has been haunting my life for as long as I can remember, but at the same time, I'm very annoyed that people are writing everything off. This is my greatest fear and has been for my entire life. I've ALWAYS been anxious about it. Why all of a sudden would these symptoms be manifesting themselves because of my anxiety?

  
I really, really just want a guarantee that I'm okay, but with MS, there is no guarantee. I can't end up like my father, and I don't know what to do. Anyone else have experience dealing with people dismissing their anxiety after a while? Feeling like people are getting sick of you and aren't taking you seriously anymore?

1pic2nd,Advice on feeling anxious about body temp?,"First off, I just want to say I’m new to this sub so I’m super sorry if I’m posting in the wrong place! If I am just lmk and I’ll delete it. I chose this flair because I’m on mobile and can’t edit to be more specific but it would be tw lymphatic.

So, I’ve (18F, UK) had a swollen lymph node behind my jaw for like three quarters of a year now. Doctor says it feels benign to her, my bloods are all fine (including LDH and stuff), and it hasn’t changed or grown at all since I felt it. The doctor gave me a list of symptoms that would be worth representing for and among those was unexplained fevers.

Over the past couple of days, I’ve felt like I’m coming down with a cold. Super tried, heart being a little funky, and a mild sore throat with little spots on the arches. I visited family late last week who have since gotten sick with a cold/flu type virus and my mum who I live with says she feels like she’s got a cold too. The thing is, yesterday evening (second day of symptoms), instead of progressing like a typical cold and getting a runny nose and stuff, the sore throat more or less went away and I started to feel a bit warm instead. This morning/midday I think, I took my temperature and it was 38.1C! Obviously I’m pretty freaked out. I’ve never seen my temperature that high unless I’m more obviously sick, and like I said, the sore throat has pretty much gone completely. I will say, I’m also in the 10 days before my period’s due, a time slot where my temperature goes up by quite a lot anyway. Since my baseline temperature is around 37.1, I’ve seen it go up as high as 37.7 just from being in my luteal phase, though it’s more often around 37.5-6. I’m not sure whether this increased my baseline and a minor temperature increase from fighting a bug got added on top of that or what, but I can’t listen to logic. My brain is just like. This is an unexplained fever you must have the Big C!!! I know LOGICALLY fevers like that would follow a pattern and stuff but my brain is like nuh uh it’s scary unless proven otherwise.

My temperature’s gone down to like 37.7ish now but I still can’t stop thinking about it. Can someone tell me I’m being dumb and it’s just a (SUPER WEIRD AND NOT PRESENTING NORMALLY AT ALL) cold or provide some other explanation for why my temperature got so high with minimal symptoms? Do you think this counts as an unexplained fever? Sorry again in case I’ve posted this wrong and for rambling, haha",1765298109.0,5,2,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
1pi9tjb,My 15 year health anxiety recovery story,"I had very extreme health anxiety in my 20s and 30s, I am 49 now and have not had any anxiety for 17 years.

Let me tell you how bad

**I worked out I lost 26,500 hours to it**

**I spent £15,000 on medical tests, colonoscopies, gastroscopies and more at 28 years old**

**I saw counsellors**

**Read many books**

  
Ironically I was still relatively successful, goodness knows how.

Anyway, my ""theory"" and it is nothing that new. Is pretty simple and I tried many things and this actually worked.

1) When I thought of a health issue, I got an immediate fright response. Tangible one.

2) This led me to try to find reassurance and alleviate it. Naturally. Welcome to Google.

3) When I was on Google, oddly my mind was elsewhere at least, in a sense.

4) I would sometimes get mild relief, that clear test, that Google line that made my illness impossible.

Unfortunately though, this did nothing to break the pattern that was the issue. It if anything reinforced it for next time.

In fact, I probably was getting some sort of relief from the whole thing in a twisted way.

So I looked at it differently. How could I make it so when I had that first thought my knee jerk initial reaction was not panic. That was step one. How could I close the loop of Google, Panic, Repeat.

So I did the following and it sucks at first!

1) notice the thought

2) is it truly realistic? like does it need action. If yes take the action immediately, if no, thnik about ANYTHING else and IMMEDIATELY.

3) thank myself for being so prudent but saying that it was not necessary.

Repeat.

What this does is gradually reprogrammes that initial trigger response.

Also, it makes it so you can see progress IMMEDIATELY. Like progress can be one less intrusive thought, a stepping stone.

You need to trust this and it is not easy at first. Thoughts do not like to be disregarded like this, they are there to protect you.

In time and for me a couple of weeks there was a huge improvement and the initial triggers did not have the same power.

let me give you an analogy.

You have a dog, it jumps up for food on the table. You feed it your food. It will come back every time.

If you are not giving the dog the food at the table, it never gets it, it stops coming back altogether eventually.

This is how you can get with intrusive thoughts.

Now I am still living the same life as everyone else 17 years later, I have kids, worries etc but one thing I am NOT is anxious and I wrote a book about this from a hotel bed in Thailand when I was actually sick. 

The irony is I felt so calm lol. 15 years of worry about illness then got ill and I was absolutely fine. What a f\*\*\*\*\*\*\* waste.

More so for me it would be constant searching of symptoms and ultimately making my anxiety worse. Hence, leading to the obsessive tracking that could maybe pinpoint patterns and record those patterns. I think the recording aspect comes from to research more with new patterns or use it as evidence during doctor visits. However, you know how doctor visits go when you bring evidence(they don't care :<). So I’m wondering more from a psychological perspective: How do you see this tracking obsession?

Spoiler Alert, its not. Lots of tests later and low-and-behold I am a healthy 30 y/o F with an anxiety disorder. But it feels so very real! 

Things that have helped: 
 
Meds: I was apprehensive at first but this has been positive to help me to cope and change my brain chemistry. 

Therapy: Talk based therapy and the dreeded exposure based therapys have helped. Also side note it may get worse before it gets better and thats normal with therapy.

Having an anchor person to help me when I am starting to spiral 🌀 my husband helps to talk me off the metaphorical ledge 

Calming books to distract my brain, I use audio books and do a puzzle game on my phone to help me calm down while it passes. 

You are going to laugh.. but weeding my backyard or playing badminton 🏸. No one can have a medical emergency and play badminton at the same time lol.

The wait 15 minutes and re-evaluate rule. If I cant stand it, take out on a timer and wait 15 minutes before doing anything you might regret (like calling EMS). 

Do the body checklist, when is the last time you ate, drank water? 

Go to sleep or take a nap if you can💤

Exercise… it is a positive feedback loop of hey! I survived! and I am taking steps to stay healthier to prevent disease. 

Remember that if it was a real emergency you would know! Big bad things do not go away! And if you go to ER they will clear you and send you to a cardiologist and blah blah blah down the rabbit hole it goes. 

Tell it! Hey!! Im done with this! I deserve to rest and relax after a long day of work and that is exactly what I am going to do. I am not a victim to this feeling! I am still in control. So get out of here! You aren’t welcome here, be gone. You don’t pay rent to live inside my brain! I am in control of my feelings and actions. I dont need to let this bother me anymore! 

Trust your loved ones, they would encourage you to seek help if it was a medical emergency.

DO NOT GOOGLE YOUR SYMPTOMS. We can “what if”our whole lifes away if we let ourselves. Let the doctor play doctor, not you.

1pgqsp5,"Understanding nuance, relative risk and absolute risk when it comes to headlines","If you're like me, you see a lot of scary, likely clickbaity headlines that start making you anxious and you go into 'research' mode. But let me try to tell you some things that might reduce some of that anxiety.

First of all, we need to understand relative risk vs absolute risk.

Relative risk is when we compare the risk between two groups - like smokers vs nonsmokers. 

Absolute risk is the actual likelihood of an event happening.

It's important to know this because you'll see headlines that say doing this or eating that will increase your risk of X thing happening by however many percentage points and it *sounds* scary when it's presented like that. It's not to say that *all* are inaccurate but there are many that *are* and can cause unnecessary panic.

The headlines are going to use whatever they can to get clicks, and if you're not familiar with those concepts of relative vs absolute, it can be very frightening to see and set off your anxiety. In some cases, the absolute risk can be very low or just low enough that while the *relative* risk is increased, it might go up a percentage point or *less than.*  At most, it could contribute to an extra case a year of whatever the topic is - *if that.*

It's not always the case, of course. Some lifestyle habits truly do contribute to the risk, but there's no nuance in these headlines, usually, like if you see that *eating this food can increase your risk of X by 200%*

Nuance is very important, especially when it comes to information like this. Remembering that correlation does not equal causation is also important. There *might* be a potential link but there could be many other factors that could play into it as well. It's not always this explicitly causes that. 

Let's talk about that melatonin study. If you'll recall, there were findings that suggest long term use is linked to heart issues. First of all, this was an observational study. These kinds of studies can't prove causality because there's too many variables that aren't being accounted for. It's not as controlled, so it can show an association or correlation, but it can't prove A directly causes B. 

Experts have suggested there are likely other factors that play into it - lifestyle, undiagnosed sleep apnea, the severity of the insomnia, etc. The medicine might not have anything to do with it at all. 

I don't know if this was helpful at all but I hope it was to some people. ",1765134851.0,9,1,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

1per6d1,Increased HA due to tragedy that happened to an acquaintance,"Hey everybody, I’m 24 and female, and over the last month, my health anxiety has spiked up to levels I haven’t known before, occupying my thoughts on the daily. This was triggered by a tragic event that happened in the summer (somehow, my HA only flared up months later) in the course of which a young person that I was acquainted with died very painfully and unexpectedly. I won’t say what exactly happened so that you all won’t become triggered with that same particular worry, but due to excessive and obsessive googling, I can say that it’s a rare occurrence, and super rare for a healthy, young person, so this poor girl just happened to get very unlucky. However, although I know the statistics, my brain now thinks that because it happened to someone I knew, it must be a tangible danger and it could happen to me at any second and very painfully, like it did for her. This has caused me to spiral thinking about all the ways in which I could die, especially related to a medical emergency. My atheism has exacerbated these feelings since I think we will stop perceiving when we die, and I keep thinking such an emergency would disrupt all the plans I still have for my life.

The average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**

This means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.

* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where ""marinating in the positive"" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).
* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.
* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).
* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.
* Declaration of living life in the ""here and now"", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.
* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: ""being perfect"" vs ""being good enough"").

**REGARDING ""journey updates"" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the ""update post"" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post.

1p8pslb,How I Overcame Health Anxiety,"TLDR: I am living a normal life again after doing Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) Therapy with a professional psychologist. ERP is the gold standard for treating health anxiety. 

Hi! This post is about my story successfully working through my health anxiety, primarily talking about the type of therapy I did and how it worked. I spent the past five months seeing a Psychologist that specializes in health anxiety, and I wanted to share my story here today. I went from being borderline suicidal to my health anxiety officially being in remission. Here is my story:

Disclaimer: I don’t use reddit much, and haven’t looked at this subreddit in a very long time. So if everything I write here is just preaching to the choir, please don’t go too hard on me! Also, I’m NOT a doctor or therapist. Just someone that has experienced debilitating health anxiety. This post is meant more for support than it is to be a comprehensive guide. If some of the thoughts I’m offering aren’t helpful or are straight up wrong, please call me out. My main goal is partially to talk about concepts learned in therapy for health anxiety, but mostly it is to show that I was able to work through my health anxiety, which I never thought possible. Hopefully that means you can too- it’s possible.

Background: I’ve had on and off severe health anxiety from 2020. It started when I found a “problem” in my groin- it ended up being benign, but since then every symptom I’ve had anywhere on my body, I always assume it to be the worst case scenario. It had been manageable for a while until earlier this year, I got laid off from my dream job, then had to move back home across the country and live with my parents again as an adult. Life was pretty unpleasant, but got worse after I felt “problems” in my neck and convinced myself I had an incurable disease. (Not going into details here) I went to the doctor, they did tests, said I was 100% fine. But of course, I didn’t believe them, because I had other related symptoms later on (which mostly ended up being symptoms caused by anxiety itself). Looking back, from May-July, I ended up going to 7 different doctors, and paid over $6,000- just to be told by everyone I was fine. Yet no answer satisfied me. Familiar story? I was in such a pit of despair I finally decided to spend the last of my savings to start seeing a psychologist, someone that specializes in health anxiety. This was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I’ll try to be done with the trauma dumping, and use the rest of the post to talk about what I learned and how it helped me. 

The health anxiety cycle: The first thing I learned in therapy was the ‘health anxiety cycle.’ This is an oversimplification, but essentially, with the anxiety cycle, you start with a trigger. This could be a bodily symptom, a news article, hearing a conversation about illness, etc. Coming into contact with the trigger makes your anxiety spike. We then try to reduce our anxiety, with ‘safety behaviors.’ This could be anything like poking the part of your body that worries you, searching Google/reddit/chatgpt, scheduling (a not medically necessary) doctor’s appointment, asking family/friends for advice, etc. In the short-term, this causes your anxiety to go down. The bad part about this is that it trains your brain to rely on these safety behaviors every time your anxiety goes up because of a trigger, thus making the cycle (and long-term anxiety) get worse. (There is more info online about the health anxiety cycle- don’t want to dump too much info here). 

Question + Treatment: Most people are probably here because they want to have certainty about their health, and the fact that they don’t have it is anxiety inducing. I want to go ahead and ask: what is more anxiety inducing for you: knowing that you have an illness, or being uncertain if you have an illness or not? I could probably phrase this question better(sorry, I decided to write this post at 2:00am for some reason), but at least for me, the later was more anxiety inducing without a doubt. This probably isn’t the case with everyone, but my thought always was ‘at least if I know that I have a specific illness, we will know what the next steps are.’ Either way, the treatment is the same: To break the anxiety cycle mentioned in the last section. The way to do this is with a type of therapy called Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP).

ERP: ERP is the gold standard for treating health anxiety (according to my psychologist- again, I’m not one!) However, the way it works is likely not what you think, and the answer may disappoint you. BUT - stick around. It DOES work. The disappointing part: the goal of ERP is NOT to give you certainty about your physical health, which is what I’m assuming most of us truly want. (Side note on certainty: I had so many frustrating sessions where I would ask my psychologist if my symptom of the day was real or likely due to anxiety, and she would always smirk and say ‘who knows?’ ) The goal is to expose yourself to your triggers, WITHOUT allowing yourself to engage with your safety behaviors (like excessively asking for answers like I mentioned with my psychologist). I’m not going to lie. At times, it’s very tough, and can make anxiety spike in the short term. But over time, repeating this method trains your brain to tolerate uncertainty, reduce anxiety spikes, and weakens the belief that distress signals danger. This is an oversimplification, but there is ton of information available online about ERP and how it treats health anxiety. If you can afford it- I highly suggest you do it with a trained professional, preferably with a therapist/psychologist that focuses on behavioral therapy and Anxiety/OCD. There are also tons of books out there that talk about overcoming health anxiety that are amazing. 

ERP Example: One of my many anxieties was worrying about my weight. If it was ever so slightly off, I would have a panic attack as I thought it meant I had an illness (even though your weight can vary a lot throughout a week or even a day). Looking at the anxiety cycle mentioned earlier, I would try to get my anxiety (worrying about weight) to go down by weighing myself, so I could be ‘certain’ that I was healthy. I ended up weighing myself maybe 5-10 times a day. It made me feel better, but only for an hour or two. It got to a point where my family ended up throwing away the scale. But that didn’t actually help my anxiety, and I ended up going to multiple pharmacies every day to weigh myself. Overtime, anytime I thought about a scale or drove by a pharmacy, I would have a panic attack in anticipation that my weight could be off. Here was the exposure that my psychologist designed for me around this: (Reminder- ERP only works when you are not allowed to respond to your trigger. The more you expose yourself to your trigger without responding, overtime, you no longer see the trigger as a threat) the first week, I would drive to the pharmacy in sit in the parking lot for 30 minutes. During that time I was not allowed to go in. After 30min, I was allowed to weigh myself once. Week 2, same thing, but couldn’t weigh myself until later in the day. Week 3, I had to go inside and sit next to the scale and not weigh myself for 30min. If I wanted to weigh myself after, I would have to wait at least an hour until after the exposure was done. The goal with ERP is to cut out your safety behaviors completely, so now, months after this, it escalated to me not being allowed to weigh myself at all. And I haven’t weighed myself in over a month! Earlier this week, I ended up going to a family members house for Thanksgiving. My family is pretty cluttered, and for whatever reason they had two separate scales in their house. Once I saw them, I had a minute of anxiety, but with my ERP training, the anxiety subsided as quickly as it started, and for the rest of the week I didn’t have a single urge to weigh myself. (This is actually the reason I decided to log back into Reddit for the first time in a while, as I was so happy with my progress and wanted to share that progress is possible!)

Conclusion: Health anxiety has cost me thousands of dollars in (unnecessary) doctor’s visits. It has cost me months, if not years, of stress. It has prevented me from doing the bare minimum, at times finding it too much of a struggle to even get out of bed and brush my teeth. So at least for me, health anxiety is itself, an illness.  Through time and effort, I am now being able to live the life I want to live again. It’s not always perfect. Sometimes I still have anxiety that bubbles up, like earlier this week when I first saw the scale. But it’s nothing like it was before. I used to have endless panic attacks for weeks/months on end. I used to do dozens of safety rituals a day. Now almost none at all. Again, this isn’t meant to be a guide. And I do not mean to imply that taking care of your physical health and seeing your doctor (when medically necessary) isn’t important. But I posted this as I have been struggling with severe health anxiety for years, and thought I could never feel better, but I have. If you make an effort and put in the work, so can you. I’ll say it again. Progress and healing IS possible ❤️. 

I didn’t want to trauma dump too much or make this into a book, so if anyone wants to DM me I’m happy to do so. (And again disclaimer that I haven’t been on this sub much- so if this info isn’t helpful or if it’s in anyway wrong, please let me know and I’ll take it down!)",1764318654.0,73,20,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

1p8bnyb,My family especially and people around me have negative connotations with being proactive in health and assume it is hypochondria.,"I am not a ‘normal’ hypochondriac I guess you would say. I don’t know if even I’m considered a hypochondriac. Im 27F and I would say am proactive in my health. I don’t jump to conclusions and immediately think I have the worst disease possible or that I’m always sick but I do research when I have symptoms to figure out what it could be. I want to get help with things before it gets too bad and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. Both my parents were nurses so they think they know everything and said I would be a terrible patient to have. I don’t go in to the doctor thinking I have everything and don’t quote WebMD or anything like that.

My family, especially my parents and brothers think I’m a hypochondriac every time I bring up something and they are very set in their ways of thinking (my parents specifically). It pushes me away from them and I don’t want to talk about anything that is wrong with me anymore because of this cause they always dismiss whatever I’m feeling. My mom got really sick more recently and maybe if she was more proactive she could have caught it sooner. She is getting better now but it was still scary. I’m not saying it’s her fault but it just makes me upset that I have to not be myself around them sometimes. They are this same way with a lot of things, especially about religion or politics. I just avoid these topics.

What are good responses for this? When I say I’m proactive they just say that’s called being a hypochondriac.",1764273808.0,16,19,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

1p1co5q,Cyberchondria: When Google Makes Health Anxiety Worse,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been thinking a lot about how much the internet affects our health anxiety. There’s even a term for it: cyberchondria. When searching symptoms online makes us more anxious instead of reassured.

Recent studies show that:

* People with higher health anxiety often feel worse after looking up symptoms online.
* Information overload and “infodemics” can intensify worry and even lead to compulsive checking.
* Improving digital health literacy. Knowing which sources to trust and how to interpret info, can help reduce anxiety.

I’d love to hear from you all:

* Do you feel the internet makes your health anxiety worse? How often do you check symptoms online?
* What coping strategies or boundaries have worked for you? (e.g., limiting search time, trusted sources, therapy)
* Has learning how to evaluate health info helped you feel more in control?

Let’s share tips, experiences, and maybe figure out how to make peace with the internet while keeping our anxiety in check.",1763570575.0,91,19,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
1oz0blr,"Anxiety as ""work"" to ensure a good outcome.","HA is so exhausting. A little story to begin:

This past fortnight mine flared up bad when my family with very young children was exposed to covid over a weekend, and then again over the next weekend thanks to PIL who didn't test to see if they got it from the first exposure.

When the pandemic started my minor HA went nuts, and then I had covid 1.5 years ago and got mild long covid after, which has given me HA about respiratory viruses. I've seen psychologists and done online courses (thiswayup) and thought I had it under control. 

But this week sent me into a spin. I was testing every day, sometimes 3 times a day despite no symptoms and then finally a few days ago I tested a little bit positive, then very faintly the next morning, and then negative. So probably a contained infection. Since then I've done like 5 or 6 tests all negative.

But my brain just doesn't want to believe the negative tests. When I tested positive it was so relaxed and I was calm. Now it is negative I keep thinking ""are the tests faulty"", ""did I do it correctly"", and then ""were the positives actually false positives and I'm still going to get it"" etc etc. Just reassurance seeking on steroids and nothing does, classic fucking HA. Now I'm gonna do one more test to do the ""48 hours of negatives = clear"" and I'm nervous as fuck. What if its a postive, could it be a false positive etc etc etc. Keep in mind whole family is healthy and no symptoms!!!!

So what does my brain actually want?... I'm starting suspect it just wants to be anxious. When I put my CBT techniques into practice and calm down etc, there is a part of me that is always suspicious. **I think by brain thinks that anxiety is ""work"" that needs to be done to ensure a good outcome.** I think this is to compensate for the lack of control.

1orkbtw,Lets start a weekly laugh off thread,"Hi all,

We all have been bugged by various symptoms month after month.

New symptoms arise, old symptoms get lost all of a sudden.

And we lose our mind again. 

But the most important thing that we are losing is time. A time which could have been used to live our life to fullest. We all know that our fears of disease are going to come true down the line as we grow older and older. So why not live life till then?

I am planning to start a weekly thread about all the new symptoms that you experience. And we all together will laugh out loud, make fun of that symptom (not you)

The reason behind this is, when we talk about a symptom here, we dread on it and it stays on our mind for a long time. Lets try associating it with a light, fun, humorous thing and I am sure it would bother us less although can be little but for sure it will help some.

1oqj4v1,Ruining my relationships because of HA,"I’m ruining all my relationships because of health anxiety and medical trauma

This isn’t venting I just genuinely don’t know what to do here and need advice. I’ve had health anxiety since I turned 18- I worked really hard on erp therapy (exposure and tolerance building) got to a really great place and was doing amazing. Then I had something really rare and devastating happen to me that wound up with a longer ICU stay, then following that another hospitalization regarding another long health fear I had for years not even a month after the icu stay.

This shattered my sense of safety- especially as the initial icu stay took me advocating for myself at 3 hospitals before they actually tested me and then me being rushed into critical care because it was so bad and my care had been so delayed from them not believing me because I have anxiety. 

My trust in the medical system kinda broke, my trust in my health shattered, and all my exposure work and practice just feels like was stripped away from me. 

Since then- it’s been about a month and my health anxiety is the worst it has ever been, alongside trauma. I’m working with my therapist on the trauma and retrying exposure but I never feel safe anymore. 

It’s ruining my relationship with my mother and father because I’m always crying and wanting to rush to the ER and be tested over things. And they keep saying you’re fine, you’re fine and then yelling at me that I can’t keep doing this, that they’re exhausted running me around 24/7 and my constant panic. They just keep saying well your results two weeks ago said you were fine, and then I say but I don’t feel fine, I’m not ok right now because I was supposed to be fine and just anxious and then I was in the icu and then a month later back in the hospital undergoing more things. 

I get why they’re tired of it and I get from their perspective this is useless and expensive and a waste of time. That i should feel calm and relieved, but my entire world has been shaken from the ground up again. I worked so so hard to get to a point of confidence and trust in my body and it feels like it was stolen from me. I want to feel safe again and find grounding- I look over my old therapy notes and use my coping techniques and try exposure but my nerves are a frayed wire and the nightmares of my icu stay and subsequent rush to the hospital for another emergency wake me up at night crying. 

I don’t want to keep going to the ER and I hate I’m ruining my relationship with my parents. I’m trying to explain I don’t like this and that I’m trying to recover but it’s only been a month. ",1762484192.0,22,20,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
1oomu4b,Health anxiety is mostly about control,"Hey guys!

I don’t know if this is going to be useful to anyone, but I decided to write it anyways in case it helps someone.

English is not my first language so I apologize for eventual mistakes!

Well, after years of therapy I understood that my health anxiety was, in fact, about control. I noticed there were moments in my life (specially during childhood) that I felt I was completely out of control of certain situations (most of them traumatic) and I had this huge fear of losing control of myself. My parents are also very neglectful with their health and I’ve seen them going through major heath issues growing up, which I also think collaborated for my health anxiety as a way of trying to repair, unconsciously, this somehow (for exemple: because my parents didn’t take care of themselves, maybe if I can take care of myself, I will change what happens/happened).

And that’s why anticipating diseases and problems makes me gain a sense of control, because I think that now that I have all these diseases in radar, I can prevent them or prepare myself mentally and emotionally in how to deal with them.

Other thing I noticed is that my health anxiety was also provoked by a huge fear of death, which, in the end, simply translated to: I want to control when I die.

Once I became aware of this huge need for control, I started to let go of it. How did I do that? Through spirituality. I began watching I bunch of NDEs, stories, visiting spiritual centers and following a thousand pages that talked about death and God. Not because I’m religious and think that only god can solve all our problems, but because I need something greater than myself to take control of my life for me, so I don’t worry that much. And since I can’t hand that control to another person, I handed it to God/the Universe/The Everything (whatever you want to call it).

Because of that, I could surrender control and whenever I feel anxious I imagine myself just floating in an endless ocean and letting my body move along with the waves with no direction. It helps me remember to trust, to trust in that force that is not me.

That’s it! I hope it helps someone out there.",1762298564.0,142,24,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

The average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**

This means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.

* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where ""marinating in the positive"" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).
* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.
* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).
* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.
* Declaration of living life in the ""here and now"", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.
* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: ""being perfect"" vs ""being good enough"").

So with dealing with health anxiety I find I bounce between symptoms to focus on. These are genuinely real symptoms but my mind fixates on them constantly.

I, like many of us I assume, go to the doctor. These are professionals, some who specialise in a distinct area, for decades.

These are people who have since thousands of patients and understand how the body works. Why can’t I shake the feeling of they are wrong. Even with second opinions! What’s the point of going to the doctor if you’re not going to believe them. Even after tests too.

1ohrme9,This is your sign to get the vaccines you’ve been putting off getting,"I haven’t gotten my flu vaccine in 4 years because my health OCD convinced me that I would have an allergic reaction or that it would make me incredibly ill because it’s been so long since I got it last. I have been making progress with exposure therapy and i decided today was the day. I went to my local pharmacy and asked to get it. Got it done and sat for 15 minutes to make sure I didn’t have a reaction and now I am home!! Once I start my new beta blocker I plan to go to the health department and get any other vaccine I need to get. Especially if you’ve gotten the flu vaccine (and Covid) before you are very very very unlikely to have a reaction. The feeling a little sick after is NOT the flu, it just means it’s working and your immune system is learning how to fight off the flu. If you have been putting off getting your vaccines due to health anxiety, take this as a sign to go for it (obviously speak with your doctor before any vaccine). You are capable of handling a lot more than you think and it is a huge step towards healing❤️

1oh8gog,How to support a loved one with health anxiety that progresses into somatization,"A family member of mine came to me with fears and concerns about their health around a year ago. I supported them, but as someone with anxiety myself I immediately realised that their anxiety was making things far more worse than it seemed the physical symptoms should have on their own. 

They spent a long time convinced they had a range of progressively more and more obscure diagnosis, and only when ruled out definitively via scans would they get relief. Only this relief would get shorter and shorter everytime they went through this cycle. Now they’ve just live with a huge list of non-specific symptoms. 

They’ve been unemployed and suffering for months now, convinced that something is killing them and if they stop worrying about it for a moment it will get them. Everytime there’s a doctors appointment or scan symptoms escalate, and every time they’re distracted effectively symptoms subside. The pattern is clear to everyone but them. 

The thing that makes it really hard is I’ve been trying to get them to trial different mental health medications, but they’re extremely reluctant to. They also downplay the role of their mental health to their doctor (and themselves). It’s so frustrating - they will research and seek so much reassurance from doctors, but won’t even reserve 30% of that mental effort for trialling mental health treatment to see if it makes them better. Theres such a strong denial component.

i’m in this cycle where every doctor tells me it’s my mental health, but all of my mental healthcare professionals are having a hard time helping me because they all believe it’s physical. i have been to the hospital so many times where they tell me it’s my health anxiety, and i am begging them to check me into inpatient because if my health anxiety is so bad than i need help. but they are never responsive. i just don’t know how im supposed to get better",1761492668.0,9,5,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

1of01fx,Few Assumptions About You and Your HA,"So... Don't hate me :) the goal here is not to generalise BUT I have studied health anxiety and related things more that I should. The goal of this post is to understand if my assumptions are correct.

When we assume, we  make an ass out of you and me so they say! I am happy for it to just to be me that is the A$$ here but here we go! My assumptions based on this, myself, my studies and book are below. They will not apply to everyone and I am really keen to understand if they apply to you.

1) You feel helpless that there is no solution and this is just a part of life

2) You are a deep thinker outside of your health anxiety

3) This is not the first time you have overthought, you might have been known as a worrier, had another form of OCD or GAD.

4) You might have had an unsettling childhood or something that made you feel out of control

5) You would consider yourself above average intelligence if pushed though wouldn't like to admit that

6) You know a part of you knows this is not real but cannot access it. It is like you are in two parts.

7) You don't see a way out of this or cannot imagine feeling differently about it

8) You feel quite disempowered

The reason for this post is a mod told me to not sell anything on here (I wasn't, I was giving something) but also said ""we are all just trying to get by""

That really hit me. Yes you are trying to get by and I really get that. In the midst of this, getting by might be the best you have. I was there for 15 years, daily. I could only get by. 

What changed for me personally was likely a few things but the main one was understanding myself more and why I thought the way I did. 

Personally I think it was part hereditary, part childhood and part coping mechanism. 

The breakthrough was when I realised I didn't have to ""get by"" and that ""getting by"" was for me personally not good enough anymore. That I had a choice and that neuroplasticity can reverse whatever or whoever you think you are. Fact. And that to do that you need to untrain this.

That everything is a pattern and that you actually do have control over it. It took me as I say 15 years and I don't want it to take you 15 or more. 

Fuck getting by frankly. This is a life. It is uncertain and it always will be and I realised the one I was protecting with my HA was not even half of a life.

How did I do it? Flipping thoughts fast that were repetitive and diverting whilst taking action on ones that needed my attention. How did I know which? Deep down you know, push comes to shove you know.

So sorry this might sound unsympathetic. No one has more empathy for you than I do. But you are in control and this ""trying to get by"" attitude, I believe, keeps you under the control of this.

Message me for anything. I am fine with being wrong also. I am also fine with lacking control on things but I can control what I fixate on and for 12 years now I have had no anxiety at all. (I get all the other life shit though lol)",1761317973.0,9,31,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

1oedodv,What’s the best way your loved ones have supported you through your health anxiety,"sorry I gotta keep this really vague because my post keeps getting taken down because the bots misunderstand what I’m trying to ask lol.

My bf is struggling with very severe health anxiety rn. He’s went to get on track with the help he needs from the physician but I don’t know how the most constructive way to support him is in the meantime because he’s having a really hard time.  He’s on new meds that have a really difficult adjustment period and have a lot of side effects that are triggering

Almost every conversation lately is him reassurance seeking and I don’t know how to help. I don’t want to give in to this compulsion because from what I understand the brain functions a lot like OCD and giving into those compulsions with him is only feeding the beast and worsening those thought cycles, even if it makes him feel better in the moment. Rationality, explaining why he is feeling what he’s feeling only helps to a degree because anxiety isn’t rational. There was a week straight where every day he was in a constant panic attack and it really took a toll on him. When he’s in that severe of a mental space I just try to talk him down and encourage him to do breathing exercise, and the physical exercise to distract himself and stop the fight/flight adrenaline rush response. Trying to distract and change the conversation feels invalidating and rude to him but maybe it’s best? I really don’t know.

I just wanted to ask what the most constructive way to support someone going through this is because I’m kinda at a loss as to how I’m supposed to respond in these situations. What methods have your family and friends done that have really helped you cope and eased your mind when you’re struggling?

1oedgo9,I was doing so well,"This past week or two I was doing better at not thinking about or googling anything related to my current fear but this morning as I was on TikTok I saw what was supposed to be a joking video of a physical therapy student being practiced on for I think like a reflex test or something and she mentioned in the captioned she had failed it and in the comments they were talking about how this test is related to my current fear that’s can be used to diagnose it and it just triggered my fear tenfold and now  I’m desperately trying not to look it up. 

I’ve never heard of the test before but now my brain is trying to convince me that I need to look it up so I know what to look out for or try it out on myself even though only a doctor can do something like that. 

I don’t want to google it and I’m trying so hard not to but now I feel unsafe again.

1odzul7,The frustration of acting hard and still falling,"I suppose I always had health anxiety, but in my late twenties/early thirties, it began getting more pronounced. About 9 years ago, it got bad when I had a heart arrhythmia, but that in itself was a small thing (minor surgery fixed it) but before it was this overwhelming existential fear.

fast forward to late 2021, when I lose a friend to metastatic melanoma. That sent me into a bad spiral, so I went to my psych (who I'd seen previously for other issues) who recommends a cognitive behavioural specialist. I saw her for close to four years (before she left the practise) but late last year, I also began neurofeedback for anxiety. I stopped around July, having hit a plateau (and financially it was draining me).

so the thing is, the past few months, things felt ok. Minor blips here and there, but generally feeling like I have control. Until a few days ago. Small, dry patch of skin near my eyebrow. The rational, logical side of me can ennumerate many more likely things, but the Voice kicks in. Always whispering. And there's my problem. I'm not having the full blown panic/anxiety where I'm constantly spiralling into catastrophism planning - I just feel bad. Like I want to action seeing someone like a skin clinic, but then feeling like I'm letting myself down if I do that immediately. And I feel bad because I still feel that gloom and doom.

I did the neurofeedback as an option before going to medication, but I can't help but feel like I'm failing everyone, myself included. I have a new therapist, but we've only just started and I don't even know yet if it's a good match. I can't talk to my partner, because despite her having her own anxiety, she doesn't often grasp that my anxiety and hers manifest differently, and mine doesn't come on suddenly and fade like hers - mine hangs around like background radiation until I take action and make determinations on what's wrong. And I feel like I'm letting my old therapist down after several years of ""progress""- I know she'd tell me it's not as simple as that, but I just hate that this is where my mind is now and that it feels like it will always remain in this fragile state, where one small hiccup causes a shattering of what peace I fooled myself into thinking I'd achieved.

Doctor told me I was pre diabetic and needed to watch what I eat and exercise.

Was diagnosed with sleep apnea and anxiety went through the roof.

Just saw an endocrinologist and a gastroenterologist. I told myself that if they cleared stuff then I would try to believe them.

I showed them bloodwork ordered. There were some things a little high or low. They both said it's not a problem. 

Gastroenterologist said let's do a scanner so you can put this to rest. 

This week have felt normal and been functional. If it's like this it's livable.

1o78dcx,HA and Relationships,"Hello all, 

I’m glad I’ve found my people! 
No idea where my HA came from, but it’s debilitating now. 

Anyway! I was wondering how others navigate their need for the R word, and not “pestering” their family/friends/significant others? 

My husband is extremely understanding, and a wonderful support. But I don’t want to drag him down with me if that makes sense?
When I’m in a spiral, there are times when I get stuck in that loop of “but if they just agree I don’t have that, then I can move on and it’ll be fine”….which we all know it never is and the next fixation begins. In that moment though, I genuinely feel it’ll help so I try it to improve the situation all round.

Also, just reading others posts has made me quite emotional to feel like I’m not alone or being stupid, Yknow? I’m sorry you’re all experiencing this horrible thing.

My stubborn ass had to wait until i could barely function, eat or sleep and had no quality of life left whatsoever to finally agree to go to the hospital.

So i'll be going to the emergency care in the psychatric hospital now.

1nxonzk,The only way to truly move on... is maybe total acceptance.,"total acceptance that, instead of saying, no I am fine, say instead: maybe, and we don't know, but we will live fully and leave less regret if it ever is.

For many people, the core conflict here is that: ""do I at risk of X?"", and modern medicine cannot give that total confidence on this Yes or No question.

And yes, even if you have the magic test to confirm that you won't have something this life, is your life certain? No. You can still have Y, Z and W and you are still left to wonder if this is benign or not. it is almost endless. You could also be thrown into jail just because you failed to notice that child who wander aimlessly on road unattended by their parents in your car's blind spot and hit them unavoidably. And we have earthquake and meteor impact.

So, the way out is that, instead of assuming you have certain life lie ahead of you, assume you may not. This may sound harsh, but it is how certain things work. there is no absolute and there is no certainty and our life can all get robbed in front of us.

The way? live as is, literally live everyday as your last. Want to play something? if situation allows, play it. Want to travel in place XYZ? if situation allows, go for it. Want to practice swordsmanship? go before hypothetical something rob you of your motor skill. Rearrange your life goal and drop some ""long term saving and planning"" in favor of the QoL now. Don't strain yourself hard and fight for a far future you may not see, like participate in a decade-long mortgage.

This way, when answering the unanswerable question: what if we have X tomorrow and just die?, the answer is not that we need to wait and see to ensure ourselves are good, but that if it happens tomorrow, at least I did my part to reduce my regret today.

This is not to say planning for far future is wrong in general. Many people are optimistic enough so they don't have to answer the question of what if we have X tomorrow and just die?. But we are anxious and that question is deep seated in our mind. So, maybe, planning for far future is wrong for us anxious guys.",1759567002.0,23,3,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).
* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.
* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).
* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.
* Declaration of living life in the ""here and now"", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.
* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: ""being perfect"" vs ""being good enough"").

**REGARDING ""journey updates"" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the ""update post"" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post. Thank you for your cooperation.

1npekrg,A reminder from the mod team on sub rules,"Hey y’all, I hope everyone is hanging in there alright. This post will be a sticker for a while as a reminder of sub rules that seem to be broken often. 


#Self promotion

Self promotion is ALWAYS a PERMANENT ban. This is a big one, y’all. This sub is designed for people who are vulnerable and to seek help in what feels like the worst-case scenario. Please do not prey on them by trying to sell your product or by plugging your website. It doesn’t matter if it’s free or not. If you’re linking a self-created website/tool/channel/product, you will be banned. If you’re unsure if your post will break this rule, reach out via mod mail, and I or someone else will respond. 


#Symptoms

I understand why this one is broken so often, but it’s a necessity. Posting about your symptoms, asking for advice, or reassurance during a spiral actually breaks multiple rules, but the key behind those rules is triggering people. I’ve had people reach out to me via mod mail saying their day was ruined because of someone’s post that described symptoms or issues in detail, or other triggering things. Please refrain from this. We use a megathread, always pinned at the top of the sub for this. That would be the appropriate place for reassurance or symptoms, but please don’t seek out medical advice. We aren’t doctors, and we don’t verify anyone who says they are. If you must. Call your provider or reach out on another sub that does verify doctors.


#ChatGPT

Technically, this isn’t built into our rules, but I wanted to comment. Using ChatGPT as a reassurance source, medical advisor, etc., is a BAD idea. Seeking reassurance is bad in general, but even more so when it’s an AI that will do it infinitely. Please do not recommend AI to anyone on this sub. It has its uses, but this is not one of them. If you want to use it, fine, hell I’ve used it for that purpose before, but don’t recommend it here. It can really make the spiral worse for some. 




This sub is meant to be a safe place for you guys, and we do our best to keep it that way without overstepping. You should always feel free to reach out via mod mail with any issues you may have or leave them here in the comments. 




##TLDR

Don’t promote your stuff (free or paid), or it’s a perma ban. Don’t post your symptoms outside of the megathread, and don’t advise others to use AI for reassurance. ",1758726287.0,18,13,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

I used to have severe health anxiety . I used to be sure I was dying. I couldn’t even watch medical tv shows. Then one day all my negative thoughts just stopped. My depression and most of my fears vanished, along with guilt , shame etc. It’s not all roses and sunshine but I am 100% happier and I’ve been able to help quite a few people deal with their anxiety. It started for me when the voice in my head stopped.  

At some point you can see your thoughts as just the product of a given set of circumstances - sensations , sounds etc. Then we have a programmed response. Without realizing we act. When you can step back and see your thoughts, you gain some control over your life.  That and resilience training in meditation have essentially eliminated my panic attacks and anxiety.

1njeflo,"I think I may have cracked it for all of us that struggle with anxiety, burnout, doubt, imposter syndrome, overthinking……","I’m fairly new to Reddit and I’ve found the courage to tell you how I got here. I’m now in my 50s and over the years for some unknown reason I’ve always been the person friends, family, work colleagues and random people come to for a heads up on what to do next with an issue they may have. What's not really worked for me is how I’ve handled being anxious, doubtful, dealing with loss of purpose but little did I know that over the years whilst I've been dealing with these challenges I’ve built up a pretty good mechanism of pulling me through them. And strangely it created this persona of myself that I regularly check myself with. It's like having a person always with me whom I can call upon, question myself, kick myself into getting it right or starting something and who constantly helps me reaffirm my purpose. 

This is why I think I may have cracked it for all of us struggle with anxiety, burnout, doubt, imposter syndrome, and overthinking. In my opinion there is nothing more powerful than having advice, guidance, you name it right ‘in-the-moment’ it is most needed. So if you’re able to have the mind strength to develop your own persona in your head like I did, please try it, but we’re all different so it may just be a ‘no-go’ for some but who knows this conversation may help you understand how to forge your own individual persona to call upon ‘in-the-moment’ you need guidance the most.

1nhp2rb,The Only Thought Process That Helps Me,"Hi all, I just wanted to offer some advice for health anxiety. I’ve suffered for over three years with this and in all that time, there is only one thing that has ever helped me. I can’t go into too much detail here, but my health anxiety is a form of CPTSD which I developed after caring for my very unwell Dad for almost three years and then losing him. 

My dad was far too young, but up until his illness he had lived a pretty awesome life. He’d lived everywhere from Papua New Guinea to Australia to the UK, he’d worked in glass houses, been a cabinet maker, worked a boring office job for a while, been a painter/decorator and a stay at home Dad. He’d made hundreds of friends and had a close circle of really great friends to talk to and do fun things with. He’d driven awesome fast cars and bikes, done Route 66 with his best friend on a Harley Davidson, been married and had a child and so much more. Then I think about how his life would have been if he’d spent all those years worrying about having an illness, instead of living, he would have been constantly panicking, spending hundreds of dollars on tests, going back and forth to doctors, wasting hours looking up symptoms (it wouldn’t have been online for a lot of those years!), so that when he was eventually diagnosed with something, he’d have wasted all that time when he actually was healthy worrying about this illness, only to actually end up with it. 

The thing is, I could develop the illness I fear the most, the chances are that I won’t, but I imagine how I’d feel if I reach my dad’s age only to be diagnosed, realizing I’ve wasted my whole life worrying about it. 

This might not work for you, it hasn’t cured me, I don’t think I can be cured of HA fully, but it has significantly helped. When I do panic, I think about this and it really does make me think more clearly. I hope this can help, if only in a small way. ",1757950306.0,26,3,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

For those who've struggled with this too:

How bad did it get for you and what it felt like?

What kinds of thoughts and fears took over?

And what eventually helps you cope or start to climb out of it too?

So as I was writing I came to a realization that I have been going to the doctors and hospitals over every little thing for 3+ years. But here’s the realization..

*I HAVE BEEN TO COUNTLESS DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS, ER ROOMS, URGENT CARES, AND HAVE NEVER BEEN TOLD I AM SICK OR HAVE ANY AILMENT*

… and yet I still worry. I kinda laughed. It put into retrospect how much time I’ve let myself spend worrying about something that I shouldn’t even be worrying about. 

Interesting stuff, I encourage everyone to write a letter to their anxiety, never know what might come out. It’s been helpful for me.",1757462690.0,24,4,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
1ncwemp,My biggest advice.,"After dealing with health anxiety since 2021, caused by a trauma in a hospital, I’ve gone through a lot. I tried lots of things but I think I found a very good way to ease my fears. 

Statistics. (as someone who’s very bad at maths btw)

For example, 5% of the population has an illness. That’s 5 out of 100 people. Imagine 100 people and 5 out of them. You’re probably not going to be in that 5. 

Or think about people you know, how many of them has that certain illness? You may don’t even know one.

A symptom usually can be caused by lots of things. There are for example 100 illnesses which can cause it, so it’s only 1% that your symptoms are caused by that. 

I know it’s hard, I’m still struggling too but this is the only way that sometimes can help before I get a panic attack about a random illness which I don’t have. 

I hope this helped<3 We will all get better one day, I promise. ",1757455011.0,32,10,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

1nchduf,Cardiophobia and avoiding the doctor,"Hi all, I hope we're well. I know lots of people here probably visit the doctor regularly but, personally, I'm finding I can't anymore. So I just wanted to talk about this aspect (of my anxiety at least). 

I used to have incredibly severe anxiety that resulted in bad panic attacks everyday since I was 17 (I'm 22 now). It's still quite bad, but not as bad anymore. As a result of it I developed a phobia over my heart, and of doctors too. It's a real catch 22. What's worse is that I do medical research too - as fearful of my own heart as I am, I do still find it a very cool organ so I can't exactly distance myself from it or forget things.  Like this phobia is an OCD-like obsession.

I'm really determined to get over this once and for all. I want to go to the doctors to get tests to get the a;; clear but any test I have, I automatically get extremely anxious (like 180/90 anxious). To be honest, I really do feel like they will find something bad this time from the constant bombardment of stress and anxiety on for 5 years. The attacks were that bad that it feels plausible, even if unlikely.

**I've been really putting it off but feel I need to do it. I 100% am a hypochondriac, but I think unlike the majority of people, I avoid the doctors. Not sure who else is in the same boat or has the same mindset.**

1nahjht,Mental Health Is Crashing Because Of Health Anxiety,"I (28M) needed to get this out and I cant find megathreads on here (if any of you could tell me how to find a current one in search, please let me know for future reference). 

I work in a hospital and I think its ruining my life. I was diagnosed with GAD at a young age and I have been taking Lexapro for it for a little over a month now. While I feel mildly improvements, I am still ruminating and fixating on my health. Working at a hospital shows me all of the ways one can get sick. I see illness and death all of the time. I was burying it for years but now I think it is coming to the surface. I think I even developed fibromyalgia (which my aunt also has) from constant trauma and now I get constant physical symptoms. And when I'm going through a flare, it always feed into the panic feedback loop in my head.

I had actual medical problems I had to address like getting my gallbladder removed this year. Or that my cholesterol is high. I always convince myself there's worse things going on beneath the surface that they didnt catch. But maybe I just psych myself out cause they would've definitely found something off in the surgery bloodwork last May, or my PCP would have sent me a message if something was really alarming in my bloodwork like he did when he saw my lipid panel.

I can barely function now. I have Health anxiety every day. Ive never had it this severe. And I want to leave my job so bad but there's no where else in the area that pays as well or has as good of benefits as I have now. I know I need CBT so bad but...sometimes I just wish I could take a while off work to sort out therapy stuff. I keep trying to tell myself that I am still young, and the human body is really good at adapting and fighting abnormalities and illnesses, but sometimes I just spiral. I wouldn't wish health anxiety on my worst enemy. And the fact that it's so stigmatized makes it super hard to talk about. 

I also think the reason I have health anxiety is because I have medical trauma from when I was a child. I had lots of labs and doctors appointments over potential kidney problems and have had a fear of failing health and diagnosis processes since then. I was only 12 years old, it was terrifying to live through that. ",1757211531.0,35,4,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

I also try to avoid late-night Googling of symptoms because that never ends well, and I’ve learned to ground myself with simple things like taking a walk, stretching, or just breathing slowly until my mind calms down.

1n7rlep,Just something that makes me feel better,"This might not work for everyone, but it does for me sometimes and I thought maybe for some people as well. 

Since I was a child, I had health anxiety, once I told my mom about it and I remember she said to me that ""They're just humans like you and I"". I didnt know why that time but it helped me a lot. 

But now looking back, I now understood where did she come from. Lately when the anxiety comes back, I started to watch and read documentries about the ppl who has the disease that I am afraid of. Not in their extremly sufferring stage, but the ones that you to remind yourself, they're just humans. This is real, and it's just a thing in life. I think it helps me to get out of that spiral and getting touch with reality again. It's not something that ""super evil spooky nightmerish concept that comes out suddenly and haunts their victims who is specifically afraid of it"", or the videos on the internet who talks abt real diseases like scary stories to tell in the darkness. ARE they scary? yes. But its something that happens in the life and to livings, it IS a part of the cycle and life. 

My another point is, internet has been dramatized real life health issues that real people struggles so much for the sake of shock value that, it made people getting lose touch with the reality. People started to see them as like horror concepts, and forgot what actually are they and where did they come from. I'm not talking about every person who has been experiencing health anxiety, but there's a huge crowd started devoloping anxiety with this way and even without knowing truely about the thing they are afraid of-- I saw so many people who started to stop feeling anxious once someone sat down and actually explained the disease with an educational manner without misinformation and exaggeration. And I'm not talking about ""it's actually not THAT bad-"" type of conversations but explaining why and how it causes properly. People are tend to be afraid of the things that they know less about, talking about prevention and information is more effective in anyways.

This is a just a little reassurance for myself and anyone. I struggle with health anxiety on and off, but right now I’m out of the worst of it and I have realized some things. 

I know your body feels like the enemy sometimes. Like you have to constantly be vigilant or else something is going to go wrong. But the truth is your body doesn’t need you to do that. It’s already really good at what it does. It’s an incredibly advanced system and it knows what it’s doing and doesn’t need you to constantly backseat. Like any complex machine, it will have glitches and little problems, but your body knows how to deal with them. There are systems in place to repair so, so many things. I think we don’t really fully grasp just how much our bodies can deal with and come back from even with no medical intervention. your body is completely filled with systems of redundancies that kick in when threatened and can fix a wide variety of problems all on their own. 

Doctors and medicines are only supplemental and even in emergencies they’re often just there to support your own body to do what it already knows how to do.

* If you're short on vitamins and minerals, consider taking some supplements.
* Make sure you walk at least 8,000 steps a day.
* Try turning off your phone and other gadgets at least an hour before bed to help your body get ready for sleep.
* Eat a lot of greens, veggies, and legumes. Try to learn how to cook tasty and healthy food

1n5vnge,Psychosomatic or something “real”,"Whenever I have a flare of my HA, it’s usually provoked by some type of physical feeling/ailment that is very real and actually happening.

But I’m really still feeling the problem. Not just worrying and obsessing over something that’s not there. In the past, I’ve gone to the doctor and had labs and imaging for various complaints. And it’s almost always been nothing. I feel funny going to the doctor over and over again but I convince myself “there’s no way this is anxiety this time, this feeling XYZ is so real”.

So what do you do? Go to the doctor every time something comes up? The whole “wait a week and if it’s still there, get it checked out” doesn’t exactly work for me because almost always my anxiety and OCD cause it to persist for a while.

Lately tho I’ve started to view this as a good thing, and instead of being stressed over nothing it reminds me that their actually isn’t anything wrong, because if I have to search for it, that means nothing is actually wrong with me. So next time you’re looking for something to be wrong with yourself just remember that all that all that means is that nothing is wrong in the moment (like always lol) and just chill out.",1756733916.0,26,3,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).

1n4zrea,Hypochondria is extremely annoying.,"I've been suffering from health anxiety for over a year (because I watched a video on YouTube about Boerhaave Syndrome which started this all) now which has worsened this summer. I have lots of crying spells and mood swings due to the fear of a fatal or neurodegenartive illnesses. Distractions don't help much anymore, I cannot visit the doctor often so it makes my anxiety worser. It's sometimes hard to sleep due to the fear of something happening at night or I wake up in the middle of the night for no reason at all. It causes confusion-like state aka Brain Fog often which is even worser because it sometimes reinforces the fears that something is wrong with my brain even tho I'm perfectly healthy. I either binge-eat or don't eat at all depending on what my HA has latched on to. I am looking forward into therapy honestly.

Hypochondria doesn't have any benefits in my opinion. Yes I have a lot of medical knowledge but it's only out of the fear and compulsively researching on the internet and sometimes it's hard to distinguish from a real illness or anxiety. Seeking obsessive reassurance is also very annoying because at the end, it's only going to annoy the people around you and fuel the anxiety even without noticing.

Always checking and monitoring my own body is also driving me insane a little because I just want to be in peace and not constantly worry about normal sensations or minor symptoms. It's also putting a strain on Friendships/Relationships due to isolation and constant worry.

I never had any life-threatening illnesses in my life ever, I have a strong immune system and have visited the doctor last year and everything was perfectly fine. For people with Hypochondria which doesn't seem to be imporving at all, it's better to seek therapy because it will seriously be life-changing as I'm trying to do. I wouldn't wish Hypochondria even on one of my worst enemies.

It’s annoying to know that in worrying about dying you forgetting just to live, and that you’re alive right now and you have been alive for a long time. The feeling sort of forces you to live in the moment and makes it difficult to plan ahead for the future. But just remember that the time will pass anyway, so whether you like it or not, you’ll reach those months down the line and you’ll realise it’s for the best that you plan ahead. And remember that being out and about, enjoying your plans is the best way to not get trapped in a mental prison of procrastination, so make plans and get out of the damn house!

1n2ho7q,I finally overcame my health anxiety after months of struggle,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share my experience because maybe it can help someone out there.

After months of dealing with health anxiety, I can finally say I’ve cured it! Looking back, it was really bad for me. I realized how bad it was when I was just sitting and resting, but my heart rate was at 125 bpm. I used to constantly think I had the worst disease imaginable. I would Google symptoms nonstop, plan trips to the doctor, schedule general check-ups, and even get lab tests done—all because I thought something was wrong.

But now, I feel free. I don’t dwell on negative thoughts anymore. Here’s what really helped me:

1.	Sports + friends
Playing sports (volleyball for me) was huge. Having too much free time gave me space to overthink, but filling that time with sports changed everything. Not only does being physically active distract you, but being with friends gives you so much positive energy. Also, when your body is physically tired, you stop noticing those little normal pains you used to obsess over.

2.	Keeping busy with hobbies
Aside from sports, I explored photography and other hobbies. Keeping yourself engaged gives your mind less room to spiral.

3.	Mindset shift
I read a post here once that stuck with me: “Even if you really do have a health issue, if it’s your time, then it’s your time.” It sounds simple, but it gave me peace and helped me stop obsessing.

Conclusion:
Health anxiety felt overwhelming, but it’s not forever. Finding ways to stay busy, connect with people, and shift your mindset can really change things. If you’re struggling right now, just know it can get better.

The same thing would happen during the day: I would appear to be working while seated at my desk but on the inside I was caught in a never ending cycle.Sincerely I believed that if I repeatedly reenacted the scenario I would eventually determine the correct response or how to resolve it. However it never succeeded. I felt worse the more I thought. My sleep was terrible my chest was constricted and I felt exhausted all the time. I eventually discovered that there is a term for this: rumination. It's not merely overthinking in the informal sense rather it's like your mind keeps repeating the same unfavorable ideas.

Example today, my pee was cristal clear, I panicked cause I know that it's bad cause it might be a sign of me losing electrolytes, so i stopped drinking water and now it became normal again.

The only thing that brings me some sort of relief is the fact that I know I cannot have all these types of illnesses all together. That’d make me a one in a million medical enigma. So, I must be wrong about something that I’m diagnosing myself with. 

You feel all these symptoms, you diagnose yourself, and you’re a hundred percent sure you’re going to die.

I’m usually calmed down a bit from the breathing technique which helps smoothly transition me into reading. Then as I’m reading I can feel myself start to get even more calm. I’ve managed to even reach pretty zen like states doing this which is a complete 180 from unbearable panic anxiety.

So I've been struggling with Health Anxiety  for 6 years and there's been ups and downs in that time. Currently I'm in a big flare up triggered by having real health things happen to me.

 I'm struggling with catastrophic thinking so just assuming the worst with my ongoing health stuff whilst I await further investigations and also just over analysing every symptom I have and again catastrophising to a ridiculous degree. Its got to the point this time ,where I'm getting afraid to be around other people or leave the house to do things as I'm so afraid I'll have something terrible happen to me health wise in public or around others and not be able to 'escape'? the situation. Do other people experience this?

Additionally every day things trigger me to become even more anxious so I've become very avoidant. I'm mostly spending my days trying to distract myself with random hobbies but it's not working very well. I'm also feeling very dissociated  and I wake up every day not wanting to get up because I know ill just have to get through the whole day again trying to avoid completely losing it.

Anyway because of how much it's affecting me I am struggling to tell how much is my feeling unwell due to my actual health or how much is my anxiety and the 2 exasperate each other i think.Ive always struggled with knowing how real symptoms were, if they were just in my head or actually clinically significant and not being able to trust myself is not nice. Ultimately I know I need help on the anxiety front though because it is making me feel horrible most days and I'm sick and tired of it and need to go to therapy.

I had some basic cbt therapy a few years back which didn't seem to help at all but would be open to try again. I wondered if there were any other therapy options I should explore or just anything to try and help me out of this rut? I know it's a long term battle but yeah I just want some tips on things I can do to get better.

Has anyone ever got so fed up of health anxiety that they've gone completely 'cold turkey' on all of it? Anything relating to the anxiety or particular concern, just gone NOPE? 

I sometimes wonder if acknowledging it at all is just a way of it lingering in your life, ready to be triggered. 

By going cold turkey on it, I mean this type of thing: a symptom related to the concern? Completely ignore it. Resulting panic? Ignore that too. No Google, no doctors appointments, no checking, no reassurance seeking, no matter how much the anxiety wants you to believe 'what if it really is something wrong this time, and I'm missing it?'

Literally saying to yourself 'I know I'm taking a big risk, anxiety. I could be making a mistake. But given my track record, I'm willing to take that risk for the sake of my mental health and my life. If there are consequences, so be it, I'm capable of dealing with them if they arrive'.

1mtt4cj,Looking for ways for husband to cope with severe health anxiety,"Hi All!
My husband and I have been married for 4 and a half years and he has severe health anxiety. It has only gotten worse at this point and I dont know how to help him. He said he doesnt know how to cope with it and just spirals all the time. He now, will not do any physical activities because it makes his heart rate go up and that sends him spiraling. He won't leave town often because hes afraid he will pass out and people will see him, and he can't be far from a hospital. I really want to help him manage this and cope with the panic so was wondering what would be a good course of action to help him through this, that worked for other people. He is on setraline but won't take anything stronger because he had addiction problems 12 years ago and has been sober since.He just says I don't know how to help him, because I don't have anxiety myself so I am trying this.

1mtk128,What do you do when no one believes you?,"I have always had health anxiety, but it got really bad when I was about 15. I had my first panic attack and thought I couldn’t breathe, and since then it’s been a constant source of issues. 

It’s become really bad over the last 18 months, and I’ve been convinced at one point or another that I have every possible illness under the sun. I know that I probably don’t, I’m perfectly healthy and what I probably need is therapy and mental health help. 

My problem is, is that no one person has ever taking my health anxiety seriously. I’m 31 now and I remember the doctors telling me I have anxiety when I was 15 and recommended I go to therapy. My mum told me only freaks get therapy and that it’s simply mind over matter. Her and my dad used to get so mad when I had panic attacks and one year told me I was ruining Christmas because I had a really bad one on Christmas Eve. My family used to sit and make fun of me at the dinner table when I would become convinced I couldn’t breathe. 

My husband thinks I’m being overly paranoid and makes jokes about my perceived illnesses, and I try to laugh along, but it’s to the point now where it’s impacting my day to day life. 

I know I need to see a doctor, but after spending half my life being either shouted at or made fun of, I’m too embarrassed to go to a doctor. I don’t want them to think I’m wasting their time, or for them not to believe me about my health anxiety. ",1755518485.0,19,9,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
1mthac8,"Folk who fall under the Autism Umbrella, how do you Deal with HA?","Hello everyone, i hope the title doesn't appear as rude or offensive but ive been semi-lurking in the discord for the last 2 months. and currently going through a bad episode as of writing.

But one thing ive been curious and havent seen much discussion about is how other folk with autism deal with Health Anxiety.

I got Aspergers and ADHD and my HA often comes soon after I looked stuff up and more often than not I get aches and hyperawareness of that part im concerned about. (smthn im going through rn) ntm i become extremely paranoid about the thing im concerned with.

In the last 2 months ive been jumping from one fear to the next. with very little time for breaks or moments of clarity. and its been seriously mentally draining.

So I was wondering how other folks in a similar boat manage to cope with their health anxiety and could offer any kind of advice? so far my only real ways of helping was walking, keeping myself surrounded with people and hyperfixating on games or other things. which is easier said than done when my mind is constantly rushing and I constantly think about what I may have.

Once again I apologise if i come of as rude or blunt. but im at a dead end and as therapy or even going to the doctors unless its a genuine emergency is not something that's achievable for me, and im hoping I could find some helpful insights when it comes to this overrall predicament from a unique lense.

ive spent years of my life letting my health anxiety control me, especially these few months its been hard for me because im recovering from a small operation done on me (for my nausea, it was related to a polyp found in my stomach) and even though its been 48 days, i still have anxiety about it coming back or i always have this thought in the back of my mind saying ""what if i never heal, what i suffer from this nausea forever"" because i still feel nauseaus sometimes (even now) but come on, its been almost 50 DAYS. im healed now!! there are no reasons for me to be nauseaus, its just my health anxiety acting up. i am putting a STOP to this. im not gonna let something psychological make me suffer physically, im not gonna let it rule my life, and YOU shouldn't either. i even feel better now that i wrote all these! this is the day you and me both put an end to this, this is the day we'll be free!

One particular scare lasted a month and I forgot to apply for my entrace exam and wasted 6 months of my life.
Parents walked in on me in the middle of a panic attack this April of 2025. Talked with me for hours, I told them everything
My cousin who is a doctor suggested I go therapy. 
8 sessions in and I no longer have panic attacks. I still self-diagnose myself with conditions over minute symptoms and ask stupid questions on reddit. But I no longer get mentally exhausted from it. No longer spiral over it

What worked for me?
My therapist asked me to reason my symptoms. Ask myself what would happen if this is happening to me. Ask myself in the moment am I spiraling or is this something that actually needs attention. To ask myself why I didnt trust the doctors and wanted second opinions.

We also discovered that I have severe fear of death. And I am a gay man living in a homophobic country who might end up alone after his parents are gone and does not want a condition where theyre dependent on others for basic care. 

I dont know if i can fully feel normal again, but my therapist has helped me so much wherein I can do my daily tasks again and only have moments of health anxiety as compared to panic attacks daily. 

If you can afford therapy, its worth a try.

I’m a 32 year old who has recently welcomed a new baby into the family. Whilst this new baby has brought so much joy, it’s also brought a lot of anxiety.

I find myself becoming overly anxious from a health perspective (concerned that I will die young and thinking that I have some form of terminal disease) and I also find myself conscious about the time I have left with my own parents. From speaking to family members, some have put it down to the “new dad anxiety” and these feelings being a normal part of aging.

This anxiety is having a detrimental effect on my own wellbeing and I can’t seem to relax or switch off these thoughts. I’m not sure if it’s worth seeing a therapist or going back my doctor (I went recently with some concerns about some aches).

I just wondered if anyone had any thoughts or experience and could tell me whether this is normal? If so, how and when did you overcome these feeling?

There's one condition that fits a lot of my symptoms, and for months I have been really convinced that I have it. Doctor's appointment isn't for another few months, so I've been kinda thugging it out.

Lately, I've been finding myself planning around the anxiety. Stuff like considering what jobs I could get if I have this condition, what meals I could still cook and which I'd have to adapt, where I would live and how I would get around. In the moment, it seems like a logical move. Rather than struggle with the uncertainty, plan for what you'll do if it happens, and move on.

But on the other hand, I kinda feel like I'm just feeding the anxiety. I usually still feel anxious afterwards, and I've definitely googled the same topics (jobs, insurance, living accommodations) several times just to still be unsettled and unsatisfied with the answers. Am I silencing the anxious thoughts, or just validating them?

I’m currently dealing with a situation where I just had a dental check up last week and the past few days noticed something different (which I discovered from body checking unfortunately.) I want to go to the dentist again but I keep telling myself that would not make sense and is just reassurance seeking since I just went as recent as last week. I have to keep reminding myself that they are professionals and would have alerted me of anything concerning when I was there (but there’s  always a sliver of doubt in my mind that maybe they didn’t look close enough).

As a GAD / health anxiety sufferer I’ve been working on a small idea and I’d love your honest feedback.

1mltjad,How saying “I don’t care if I die” cured my anxiety in my teens.,"So I had pretty severe HA in my teens for 3 years straight, was heavily medicated (risperidal, dumirox and alprazolam) and nothing seemed to work.

Then, in an act of complete desperation and because my life was a misery I said: I’m gonna go out and if I die it’s ok

Since that day all the fear of death that was giving power to my HA vanished and consequently my simptoms started to gradually disappear.

10 years later (rn) I’m struggling again with HA and thinking: we have to found a deeper cure to this - some motto that is bigger than life and so removes our fear of death - but as I am not desperate rn I can’t say “fuck it” and cure myself that way

Edit: if we think - one of the way out of this is finding something worth living for (with the odds of something going wrong) , normally religion and philosophical mottos can help I think (I am not religious and I think that could help)

For example, she'll say things like ""I know you have health anxiety so you'll understand, but I'm terrified of \_\_\_\_\_\_"" and describe something scary!

A part of me wants to be able to support her, but it's difficult when I'm actively being triggered by even talking to her about this kind of stuff.

1mlajzl,How I Beat Health Anxiety,"One of the biggest things that snapped me out of health anxiety was realizing how irrational my fear focus really was.

Take these numbers (U.S. averages):
	•	Car crash (motor vehicle accident):
Lifetime odds of dying = 1 in 93 (~1.07%)
	•	Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma:
Lifetime odds of dying = 1 in 300 (~0.33%)

That means you’re 3× more likely to die in a car crash than from lymphoma.

And if we’re talking about life-altering injury, your odds of becoming severely paralyzed from a car accident are also higher than the lymphoma you’re stressing about.

Now here’s the kicker:
Most of us never get anxious stepping into a car. We take Ubers with complete strangers, having zero proof they’re sober or even competent drivers. We let them take us 70mph down a highway without a second thought.

But with health anxiety, we selectively focus on the least likely catastrophic scenarios, obsess over them, and give them more mental weight than the everyday risks we completely ignore.

When I reframed it like this - I’m literally choosing to fear the smaller risk and ignore the bigger one - my brain had a harder time taking the health fears seriously.

Bottom line:
If you can handle the risk of getting in a car every day, you can handle the risk of something 3× less likely. You’re already living with far bigger dangers - and you’re fine.

1mkjoeu,PLEASE READ IF CBT/Talk Therapy isn’t working,"Lots of people might feel trapped by health anxiety even with therapy and feel they can only get relief on drugs. 

Something that might help everyone out: I haven’t found much success treating this with regular CBT and talk therapy. More and more therapists are considering HA/IAD/Hypochondria under the OCD umbrella, specifically linked to Sensorimotor/Somatic OCD where we hyperfixate on our body and its functions (breathing, heart rate, vision, globus sensation, etc…) it’s becoming more and more understood as OCD because constant doctors visits, Google searches, reassurance seeking are compulsive behaviors that might make the anxiety subside in the moment but always make it come back stronger as it reinforces the cycle. 

OCD cannot be treated with typical talk therapy or CBT. In fact it can make it worse. OCD CAN however be successfully treated with ERP (exposure therapy) and ACT (acceptance therapy). 

I was being administered CBT and it didn’t work. Nothing seemed to help no matter what and I thought I was an unfixable case. It was only until I went to a psychiatrist and he determined I had OCD with my theme centered around bodily functions and health. Treatment with ERP has had FAR better success for me.

1mj9g5x,HA people with anxiety related to your GI system get in here,"Having HA with GI fears sucks because your anxiety can further fuel the ""symptoms"" (aka normal fluctuations in bodily functions) and make you believe you have evidence that something is seriously wrong with your body, or will be soon. If you have ever experienced this, you know how debilitating and scary it can be. Ultimately a good medication routine is what worked for me after years and years of trying CBT and other methods of anxiety reduction. However, even on medication that has vastly improved my life I would occasionally have some ""symptoms"" that would cause a lot of anxiety. Sure it was better with the medication; I could focus on work, I could focus on hobbies, but it was still affecting my day-to-day life. It was still one of the first things I thought about each morning. 

What finally worked for GI specific fears and somatic symptoms is an app I saw in an ad on FB called ""Nerva"". I was highly skeptical but was pretty desperate at the time. Also, it was actually advertised and marketed at people with IBS, which I did not and do not have. But I tried it and it has worked wonders for me. It talks a lot about your GI system specifically (sounds silly but you'll eventually hear things like ""your intestines will work at a speed that is right and normal for you"" as part of the session) and it really works. At least, it did for me. A lot of people with real GI diseases e.g. IBD also claim it works to help reduce their symptoms, so keep in mind you should still obviously get examined if you have red flag symptoms. For me, I saw immediate changes after the first week of just listening to the daily sessions which are like 15 min. Now, I just check in about once a year when I have a flare up of this GI anxiety and I start having BMs that trigger anxiety. After a couple weeks, I'm back to normal and living my life. Unfortunately it is really expensive IMO at $200/yr or $78/3 months. There may be cheaper alternatives, I'm not sure. For me, it's totally worth it. Just a suggestion for anyone out there suffering. It might help you take your life back. I wish I had tried it sooner because I really think it might have helped me before medication.",1754497913.0,25,15,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

I have now been 15 years without any health anxiety whatsoever. 

I always wanted to come back and help people and now feels like the perfect time.

Here are some details about the severity of health anxiety I had

* I thought I had over 27 terminal illnesses through the 15 years, like convinced
* I spent £15000 on medical testing, doctors and more (I was not rich I just used all my money on it)
* I googled symptoms maybe 8 hours a day.
* I could tell you the deepest stats on any disease I thought I had, im talking VERY deep stats, age of incidence, survival, stage, demographic, ethnicity, location, new treatments, palliative care options 0 you name it.

I read 20+ books on OCD, CBT, Fear of death, health anxiety and more. I watched hundreds of videos. I saw countless doctors. It overtook my life.

Here are my thoughts and I am happy to help anyone that needs it. It was personal to me so each person is different but here is what worked and didn't work

**What did not work**

* Using logic. This is not a logical ""disorder"" or whatever you want to call it. You could have age by incidence of 1 in 500,000 and still ""I could be that one""
* Searching Google (of course). Self confirming bias here makes searching Google a waste of time at best and utterly destructive at worst
* Multiple second opinions. You can have clean tests and many second opinions but this might still stay or will likely move on to something else
* Self checking...... I found things you would not believe when self checking, I spent 6 months obsessing over a part of my head that turns out is normal anatomy :) 

**The Aha Moment**

*  I was trying to treat myself for health anxiety but I had OCD really and thought patterns that were the harmful thing, health just was the thing they latch onto
* I had to find a way to get my mind to move on and to mean it. To change the knee jerk reaction of thoughts that sent me down a spiral of more and more to a knee jerk reaction that I trained myself to get to where I acted if I needed to and moved on if I could not act. It had to happen almost instantly and this took practice.
* I basically had to reverse the thought patterns. So I studied fight and flight responses, anxiety cycles in the brain, chemicals released and all the different methods. 

**I then developed something that worked for me**

*  Exercise. Learn to trust your body by moving it and getting stronger. If you cannot then just move your foot up and down or ANYTHING a little more than yesterday. Progress, the antithesis of deterioration.
* Medication. Personally venalflaxine although a horrid SNRI - worked for me to allow me to do the proper work. Not suggesting you take it, just what worked for me to get me to a state to ""do the work""

Then the method I made. I call it the Flip Method. 

* learn to notice your thoughts as if from a third party
* Assess them quickly and objectively, does this need action? Really? If yes, take the action right away and Flip the thought to ""I have done all I can and move on""
* If no action can be taken Flip the thought to ""I have done all I can and move on""
* Do something else

This method although very simple does the following

* Allows you to be an observer of thoughts rather than in them
* Takes action when needed (not just finger in ears and distraction
* The closing thought part starts to reassure your subconscious each time you are ok (may sound woo woo, I am not like that, try it)
* The speed of it is key. Repetitive thoughts can be flipped super fast under 4 seconds.
* It needs to be practiced, it will take time, it will become a healthy knee jerk reaction to repetitive thoughts.

Now when I say I am not anxious I truly do mean it. I have many flaws, anxiety does not have any hold on me whatsoever though and mentally I am completely free. 

My life was overtaken by this to a level most would find ridiculous, the stories I have are utterly absurd and for YEARS of my life.

This is very treatable.

I am very happy to help and would love to get some people out of this as I know better than most how hard it is and what it looks like both sides.

1mek643,Daily Positivity & HA Journey Progress Updates [MEGATHREAD]. Month of August 2025.,"**The megathread for vents, rants, worries, fixations, DAEs, finding support/advice, finding reassurance, symptom focused content, or the like is located here :** [**http://reddit.com/r/healthanxiety/about/sticky**](http://reddit.com/r/healthanxiety/about/sticky) Thank you for using the above thread for the above content as some users may experience distress if they were to unexpectedly read content that they were not mentally prepared to engage with or are just trying to take a breather from. 
___

The average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**

This means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.

* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where ""marinating in the positive"" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).
* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.
* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).
* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.
* Declaration of living life in the ""here and now"", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.
* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: ""being perfect"" vs ""being good enough"").

**REGARDING ""journey updates"" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the ""update post"" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post. Thank you for your cooperation.

1me7gnx,Tired of living this way,"just here and venting. Some days I have good and bad days.. I've had some things going on and overall that everyone thinks I'm okay, I feel like im not and it's something being missed. I hate living like this and it always being in the back of my mind of the, well what if? 

Like lately I suppose from being nervous over things and had worries... My chest just constantly feels tight and like I'm not breathing like I should be so it makes me feel like short of breath. I'll try to force myself into doing things and it usually is okay.. but then I think about it and I just feel like I a not breathing right. 

I feel terrible for my kids, I still try to do things and as much as I can but I seriously feel like I'm ruining their childhood. 

  
The things I have found that have worked for me, if I'm having an okay or good day, is just looking at myself in the mirror or just even repeating it out loud. ""You're okay, nothing is wrong."" 

Oh this is causing issues? ""Okay, so this could cause this problem, this could cause this problem too and now you aren't fixing it to try to help improve it! You're also getting older"" LOL

1mdw126,"Success: ""forgot"" to worry last several days, and i maybe know why.","I think my HA is clearing up. I've been having less spirals lately. And last several days i completely forgot about worrying about random stuff. I also did not notice any new symptom (as i did on a daily basis for several month).

The only thing i did was increase my **calories** and my **salt** intake.

A case for calories reducing health anxiety can be made by Minnesota Starvation Experiment

>Among the conclusions from the study was the confirmation that prolonged semi-starvation produces significant increases in depression, hysteria and **hypochondriasist**  
  
[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Starvation_Experiment)

By complete accident, i found that adding salt to my diet reduces my resting heart rate. The explanation is this: some people lose blood volume on low salt. Low blood volume makes it harder for the heart to pump blood. In order to pump more blood, **the body up regulates sympathetic nervous system. Anxiety is a state of sympathetic over-activation.**

So i don't know which of the 2 is responsible for my HA reduction: more calories or more salt. If i would have to guess, i currently lean more towards the salt. The timing fits better.

**Also, this isn't medical advice. My diet is heavily tailored to ME.**",1753950414.0,28,4,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
1mdih26,"Health Anxiety and the ""Packed Bags"" theory","I came across mention of this ""packed bags"" concept in the writing of a Hindu/Indian guru. Though in the book he doesn't mention or discuss Health Anxiety, I feel that this theory can be linked to Health Anxiety. 

So hear me out. 

Imagine you need to go on a weeklong vacation overseas. You need to leave at 6 pm today to catch your non-refundable flight.Ideally you start packing at least the day before and finish packing by 4 pm. Now you can relax. But if you sit doomscrolling or playing games on your phone till 5.45 pm, your bags still empty, your clothes still in the washer (not even in the dryer!), That is a recipe for severe anxiety and panic attacks. You scramble to throw some stuff in the bag and you are second guessing yourself at the airport. Did you even take your passport? Phone charger? You are going to the beach, did you take swimwear?


Same is true for any situation where you need packed bags ready. When your hotel room checkout is at 10 am, you want to make sure that your bags are packed and ready by 9 am so that you can then relax and enjoy the complimentary breakfast and don't have to worry about leaving stuff behind in the hotel room.


If you stay in an Airbnb for a month, you still need packed bags when it's time to leave. When you want to move out of the apartment you had for three years, you need to start packing at least one to two weeks in advance. You want your suitcases and boxes all packed up when the moving truck arrives. That's the only way to relax. 

If you are moving to another city or even country for a two year college course or job stint, then you not only need to pack all the important stuff in two suitcases, you also need to get rid of the not-so-important stuff.  Donate, sell, put in a storage facility. And take care of phone connection, bank accounts, incoming mail..


The reason we feel health Anxiety which ultimately is fear of death and /or disability is because our bags aren't packed. We haven't done the stuff we needed to do. Our affairs aren't in the order. Our ducks aren't in a straight line.  So we always feel like that person who needs to vacate her house tomorrow and has lots of mess and empty boxes all around her. How am I going to sort and pack everything in one day? 


So do the things you need to do. Ask yourself - what is the unpacked messy stuff in my life? How do I take care of that? Find your life purpose and start working towards it. Ask yourself how you can serve humanity, not just your own little self. Sort out your financial affairs and responsibilities.

Pack your bags. Sit with packed bags neatly lined up next to you- ready to board your flight when the announcement comes. Nobody is going to get out of boarding that flight. But if your bags are packed, you can enjoy the wait time. You are not worrying or second guessing. You are watching a movie or reading a book or enjoying food and drinks at the airport bar or shopping in the duty free section. ",1753909482.0,70,8,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

i have an appointment for a cbt screening at the end of next month, i've just been waiting, not knowing if it'll even have any real effect anyway. i miss when i would go on long walks, doing my uni work, having fun with friends, being tired after a full day, travelling, going to concerts, seeing new places, trying new activities. i'm so envious of people who can just do that no problem. havent felt joy in anything i used to for so long it's as if everything is a risk. i dont know how i can let things go on like this anymore, everything is so demotivating.

1md6u9z,This novel helped me at just the right time: A Spot of Bother by Mark Haddon,"After just having gone through a HA spiral (after my  2nd visit to the derm. ""just to make sure she didn't miss anything"" and my explaining that I sometimes suffer with HA, I feel OK thanks to her kindness...and also possibly due to me upping my sertraline dose and using ativan to fall asleep), I randomly picked up this book at a thrift shop: *A Spot of Bother* by Mark Haddon. Parts of it had me laughing out loud (which I can't remember ever doing while reading a book). I read it in 2 days.

I'm  not giving anything away that's not on the back cover of the book by saying that it's about a slightly dysfunctional family, but the main protagonist (George) is a 57 yo man who suddenly gets bowled over by extreme HA. The way the author describes George's descent into mental illness is extremely accurate and humorous at the same time, and can be appreciated no matter how old you are (I've had bouts of HA since my early teens). The humor comes from the author uncannily describing  EXACTLY how I've felt and the silly and stupid things I've done, and as you read George going through it (e.g., he goes to see ""Lord of the Rings"" to get his mind off of his HA, but his horror at seeing the Orcs for the first time  had me guffawing), I saw how ultimately absurd my thinking was/had been/probably will be again at some time in the future.

1mczez7,Positive youtube channels to watch instead of the usual media consumption?,"Hi there, first post here because I honestly don't know where to turn.

I (26 F) have been suffering with health anxiety for around 5 years now and am in a complete spiral lately. I recently have had some real diagnosed health problems, nothing major, but they did require me having to wait for test results. It's been around a month now of multiple tests and waiting periods and at this point I feel like I am going crazy. It's distanced me from friends and family, I feel completely irrational sometimes and other times I'm completely convinced that I'm right, the doctors are missing things, blah blah blah. I just feel so alone. Tonight I've been trying to distract myself by watching true crime YouTubers because it's something I enjoy, but after speaking to my therapist I can recognize that the media I consume might be affecting my mindset lately. I have no idea why I am drawn to these things, medical documentaries, scary true stories, that can not be helping me at all but it feels compulsive at this point.

I wish my brain wasn't my brain. I've had different anxiety fixations since I was a young child, from debilitating fear that my parents would get sick, small spaces, being abducted. I'm a worst case scenario thinker and am now realizing I'm filling my brain and time with worst case scenario media.

So here I am making an effort to watch something else and this has gone on so long that I don't know what to watch instead, maybe something to make me laugh would be nice. Something calming or distracting would work too!

Does anyone have any suggestions? Preferably a Youtube channel, but I also have Netflix and Disney+.

I have anxiety disorder since I was a child. For context, I'm a 27 years old female. 2 years ago I started to get really terrible health anxiety. Worse than ever before. So now, anytime I feel like something is wrong, I run to the doctor. I live in Turkey and while there is free healthcare, it is close to impossible to find appointments. So I have to pay for private clinics. I have spent insane amount of money and I don't know what to do.

I'm in a loop. I worry about something (lets say my kidneys) I get so panicked that I can't do anything else. I go to the doctor, see that everything is fine. I get relaxed for like 1 hour, than find something else to worry. So I repeat all.

Not only that I'm financialy drained, I'm so tried. I feel like EVERYTHING is wrong with my body. Even if I have only a small thing, I feel like the world is ending.

1matfg5,Progress in my first health anxiety relapse after 3 years free from it: nearly there again!,"Hello everyone! Just wanted to share my bit of experience. I have general anxiety since I was a child. I developed HA as a young adult after my first 100% random and unprompted panic attack in 2017, thinking it was a heart issue (apparently this is not an uncommon trigger for people with HA). In 2021, after finishing CBT and my SSRI treatment, I was completely healed from general anxiety & HA (as in, the thoughts were exceptionally rare and fleeting).

Last autumn, a ridiculous but \*huge\* HA trigger made me fall into my first full-blown anxiety (and HA) relapse after almost 3 years of total healing of anxiety. It was humbling and very difficult, but I immediately talked about it to my doctor, saw a therapist a few times and applied all that I had learned into CBT. It sloooowly got better and better. Some days are harder than others but when I look back, the progress is there, month by month, week by week.

My HA is still here, although it's ""low-grade"" at least compared to what it was. I say I'm nearly there because all I need now is to stop worrying ""quicker"" about my physical symptoms and stop googling (I do it way less than before therapy but, you guys know it, it's easy to fall back into the habit!)

What helps me the most at this stage, and what I want to highlight the most for other people who go through HA and read this... is the ""2 weeks rule"" where I book NO doc appointment and if the symptom worrying me is still there after 2 weeks, I do. But so far it could be a three day rule - and I haven't seen the doctor since February! ☺ 

Even though it still is here every day, it is amusing and greatly helps rationalising to see that my symptoms change so often. It's like my anxiety is pushing the buttons. I have various aches... but they keep travelling from from one body part or organ to another. Every week or so it changes. My HA is a creature and it's travelling, I hope it's having fun 😂

Remember, the body is always doing normal, and healthy things such as digestion, hormone fluctuations, etc. It also, you know it, reacts to stress. So, various aches, discomforts are normal and temporary, and they are enhanced by anxiety or HA. They'll pass, you will see. Yes, even what you feel right now, you who are reading me! :)

Anyway, that's where I'm at currently. Any of you have experienced total healing and then relapses? Are you progressing in your journey, noticing you catastrophise a bit less than you did a few months or years ago?

Stay strong everyone, be gentle with yourself, and be patient. Healing is possible!

A quick background of my story: I had an actual health episode which required me extensive lifestyle changes. During the process, I developed health anxiety, ended up in ER multiple times (to the point that I was kicked out of hospitals for wasting their time) Once, I even got a card by mail from ambulance workers with chocolate, for being their “preferential customer”. 

I looked for therapy because I had a combination of HA and panic attacks, which was very severe. I didn’t leave home, developed anorexia, my life quality was REALLY bad. And now I’m living normally, completely unburdened by HA! 

I want to share with you everything I learned in therapy, in hopes that this will help you as well in your recovery journey. 

—————

WHAT HELPED:

**Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)**. Goes without saying, *every person with HA should do it*. HA is an anxiety but it also has ties with obsessive-compulsive disorders, and both groups respond REALLY well to CBT. It’s the gold standard of treatment.

**Grounding skills.** This was really useful in the beginning. When your HA is too elevated and you have panic attacks, it’s important to learn how to stop a panic attack. There are many grounding skills; my favourite one is the 54321 senses (“Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, 1 thing you can taste”). This is important to take you away from the spiral.

**Identify your triggers**. At first your therapist might ask you to take inventory of your health anxiety. What are your concerns? What are your fears? Did you have a panic attack? On a scale of 0-10 how bad was it? What time did it happen? How did you feel? What did you do? How long did it take for you to feel better again? This is important because you start seeing patterns, and understanding how your own health anxiety works.

**At first, reducing exposure to triggers**. I had to be accountable and NOT Google. Or use AI. The cycle of compulsion and reassurance is what keeps HA alive. Cutting it off is fundamental. Instead, whenever you have a health concern: list it in a paper first. Go to a doctor and get this checked only once. Whatever your doctor says, take notes and refer to it.

**Creating “safety” cards**. Once you go to a doctor, write cards with their assessment. And reminders to yourself: “I’ve checked this. I am safe. There is no reason for worry. I am fine.” These are meant to be used as an emergency but they do help before you spiral down.

**Interoceptive exposure**. This is SO important! Your therapist might notice you have a certain fear related to a certain bodily sensation. So they will expose you to it, in a very controlled environment. Very gradually, you will develop resilience and desensitise yourself. Meaning your brain will stop bothering you whenever you feel something over time.

**Journaling**. This is more of a general mental health tip but with health anxiety it is really great because you can start noticing that you have survived X episodes, you have kept living despite thinking you have something. You also start noticing what are the things you pay attention to in your daily life, and can choose to start paying attention to other things instead.

**Emotional education**. Together with therapy, I did a free course from Therapy in a Nutshell (a YouTube channel) for Anxiety and Processing your Emotions. They are not directly associated with Health Anxiety but did teach many CBT skills to have a better life overall.

**Workbooks**. Your therapist might want you to do health anxiety workbooks. They are guided exercises that greatly help you. My favourite ones were from the government of Australia (should be one of the first ones that appear when you google “Health Anxiety workbook”, and Steven Hayes’s “Get out of your mind and into your life”.

**Be willing to accept risk**. This is, admittedly, the hardest part of treatment, and where you get your “make or break” moment. You have to be really intentional and honest with yourself: do you want to live a fully realised and authentic life, or do you want to be a slave to your fears forever? HA is about demanding reassurance because our brains crave reassurance, but we live in a world full of uncertainty and no one can give you 100% of a correct answer. The best doctor in the world could miss something. No one can predict anything. *Everybody lives despite their fears, not in spite of them.* I still remember how great it felt to leave home for the first time in a year, in the middle of winter (a major trigger for me), and feel the snow flakes falling from the sky. I literally cried of joy.

**Understanding that anxiety is an emotion and you can’t get rid of it**. Anxiety itself is not a problem. It is very important for our lives! The problem is our dysfunctional relationship to it.

**Knowing you can’t be “cured” of HA - but you do go on remission**. During therapy I had excellent progress as well as setback episodes. Setback episodes don’t mean you are doing worse. It means you’re human. And eventually after remission your HA might come back - but the difference now is that you are well equipped to deal with it on your own, and not let it fester.

I wish everyone courage to feel their emotions and sensations, and the vulnerability to live a full and beautiful life. Paraphrasing Emma McAdam on her Processing Emotions course: “The goal is not for you to feel better; the goal is for you to get better at feeling”.

1m8uiq6,How to find the difference between being understandably cautious and health anxiety?,"Long-time lurker here, and very proud to say that I’ve made a lot of progress since I admitted that I have this problem four years ago. 

However, I’m afab, and I have a few chronic illnesses, and there have been times where I’ve had to advocate for myself in order for a health concern to be addressed and diagnosed. Doctors have missed things in the past which has had bad consequences for me, which I think is how my anxiety manifested. Now, I’m having what I think are symptoms of something that could be worrying, which I won’t list here, but I don’t know how much is in my head and how much is rational concern. When I was in deep with my health anxiety, I never thought I sounded like I was paranoid, everything seemed to be rational to me, it’s only through the gift of hindsight that I can see that I was well off the mark.

1m8bbh0,To those struggling with health anxiety:,"I know how exhausting it is to live with a mind that won’t stop scanning for danger, where every quiet moment turns into a mental spiral of worst-case scenarios. Health anxiety isn’t about being dramatic or weak—it’s your brain trying too hard to protect you. It fixates on fear, uncertainty, and control, convincing you that something terrible is always just around the corner. But it’s not your fault. You’re not broken or crazy—you’re just stuck in a survival loop.

Here’s the truth: you don’t need absolute certainty to be okay. The more you allow life to move forward—showing up for your routines, engaging with the world, letting thoughts come and go—the more your brain learns that fear doesn’t need to be in charge. Progress comes in quiet, steady choices. You don’t need to feel 100% safe to live your life. Keep showing up. Keep moving forward. You’re doing better than you think.",1753379585.0,172,50,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
1m7qgyu,HA representations in media,"hi, i did a brief search on here but i was wondering if anyone has new recommendations on media centered around someone with HA?

i watched a film in my college french class called ""Cléo de 5 à 7"" (Cleo from 5 to 7) by Agnès Varda. it really touched me as the main character is convinced the whole time she is going to die (from a psychic reading) and i feel like her obsession and seeing things in the passerby, street, etc. helped comfort me with the sense that it is an irrational fear, but at the same time it captured the complexity of health fears and it wasn't just comedic.

1m4yrpi,A funny story about HA (and why you should not believe it),"Hey everyone! This is a silly HA story. I hope this may bring some reprieve and laughs as it did to me. 

I’ve been in therapy (CBT) for two years and I’ve had significant progress to the point I’m two sessions away from being discharged - as my therapist thinks I am in remission. Yay!

This week though, something ALMOST set me off. I went to a beach house with friends for a swim. I live in the Nordics and the water is notoriously chilly, even in summer. 

When coming home, I saw a blue spot on my foot. All my health anxiety alarms started to set off. I started thinking about the worst. I got really tense and was nearly falling in an obsessive spiral trying to figure out things. Was it a hematoma? A broken vessel? Was it the cold water? The ginger drink I had? Or worse?

Then I remembered my therapist’s advice: *“just because you think something, it doesn’t mean it’s true. It doesn’t mean you’re right.”*

And as I let that sink in, I tried to let go of obsessive thoughts by relaxing my shoulders, taking a deep breath, looking at my sandals…

… and there it was, a smashed blackcurrant.

I had conflated a blackcurrant stain with a hematoma.

I couldn’t stop laughing my way home. I haven’t had my session yet with my therapist, but I hope she will laugh about it too.

When getting stuck on some silly obsessive thought, remember: your brain is good at finding whys and at being wrong. Not everything is dangerous. Take a step back, focus on something else… and who knows. You may even find out accidentally an answer, and a silly one at that 😀

- your body is like a house. it will make noise, creak and slightly ache as it settles. 
- you would not think someone else with your symptoms has anything dangerous, so why would you think that about yourself?
- you are significantly more likely to die from your next car ride than whatever you are panicking about, most likely. but a friend offered you a ride to somewhere, youd likely still take it. 
- being aware of something doesnt make it more likely to happen. 
- you should be at the club, not staring at your shit. 
- if you were dying, you wouldnt be wondering whether you were dying. it would feel REAL. 
- so many people live wildly unhealthy lives for decades, and theyre fine! you will be okay. 
- the chances of you having something rare and terminal, AND the doctors missing something key in your tests is so insanely small. they dont want to lose their medical lisences either. ",1753006687.0,37,10,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
1m4kgni,It DOES get better,"I’m new to the forum and posted a thread a couple months ago when I was dealing with a really bad bout of health anxiety. I started worrying about headaches I was getting which quickly turned into worrying about every little thing in my body. My day today felt miserable, I constantly felt on edge and cried in hysterics multiple times a day.

I just wanted to share that if anyone is really struggling and feels miserable and worries and like it’s never gonna end, it does get better!  Even if it feels like your whole world is crashing down, and you don’t see a way out please just know that there is hope and as someone who really couldn’t stay away from googling every five minutes and making 1 million doctors appointment, I’m now at a place where at least for the time being I feel calm and I feel happy.

Please know that time is the biggest help. And with time, just like your current health anxiety fixation came, it will too go. Remember how you felt several months ago when you weren’t worrying about what you’re worrying about right now. In time you WILL feel like that again. I know it might sound like I’m lying and I know it might be the last thing you want to believe, and I get that because I was in the same position.

1m4eon1,The important thing I learned from a recent bout with health anxiety,"Thirteen years ago I beat leukemia.  And ever since then I've had health anxiety.  It has gotten easier to control over the years, but it's always there - lurking, lingering in the back of my mind.  And recently it came storming back like a bat out of hell.

Back in March, I got a cyst removed from my eyelid that I'd had for over five years.  It never bothered me, but it had very slowly gotten a little bit bigger.  I thought it was a chalazion.  Pathology came back - it was a fibrous nodule with ""atypical mast cells, benign in nature"".  The recommendation was to get my blood tested, just to be sure. Not exactly what I wanted to hear.

About a week later, I suddenly had some issues involving my groin and left testicle.  It stuck around for a few days, and I started to worry.  Bathroom run at work? Testicular self-exam. Shower at home? Testicular self-exam. Sometimes more than five times per shower. Sleeping on my side, with my legs together, became nearly impossible because of this sensitivity. Then my mind really started to wander.  Are the eyeball cyst and this newfound issue somehow related?  Worrying led to Google.  Google led to Mast Cell Activation Syndrome.  MCAS led to an issue with my blood.  Again.  There it was.  It's back. Its been thirteen years, and it's back, in some crazy new way that's affecting two completely different parts of my body.

Instant gratification - I need to solve this, and solve it now.  I can't produce at my job with this weighing on me.  I can't wait to see a doctor.  I need this groin issue to go away - NOW.  I'm single - who the FUCK do I talk to about this?  So, I talked to a doctor on a video call while on my break at work.  $35 and you're connected to a ""doctor"" instantly.  She prescribed an antibotic - a potent antibiotic, thinking I had some sort of testicular infection.  Took that for 10 days, nothing changed.  I tried to suppress the worry, to work throught the stress.  I became impatient, impulsive, and rude.  I called my old oncologist, whom I hadn't spoken to in years.  I got up at work, walked out of my office, and called him in the parking lot.  I needed reassurance.  I needed answers.  He told me he couldn't diagnose me, but told me not to worry.  It didn't work.  I started to lose weight - a few coworkers commeted on it.  My muscles ached.  I downloaded an app which let me order Valtrex - antiviral for herpes, which I've never had.   I didn't know what else to do.  Had a urology appointment the following week, but couldn't wait for answers.

Fast forward a week, the Valtrex did nothing.  Its been three weeks and the issue hasn't gone away.  Every little bruise or itch I get has me thinking the worst.  I'm staring at myself in the mirror, dissecting what I see.  I notice that the left side of my neck is slightly larger than the right side (I've always had this).  ""It's a lymph node,"" I think.  I start aggressively feeling for a mass in my neck, before I go to bed, as I'm driving to work, while I'm at work, while I'm on the couch.  Imagining this swollen lymph node has me convinced that it's actually there.  Swollen lymph nodes can be a sign of leukemia.  I have to force myself to stop.  *""I have a bump on my eye, I'm losing a little weight, my testicle aches, I'm not eating as much, I have a mass in my neck.  I'm going to die.""*

Urologist does an exam, doesn't suspect an infection.  Can't find anything suspicious on the testicle.  Pee test comes back clear.  Does a basic physical exam, feels a tiny little protrusion.  ""I think you have a hernia,"" he says.  Imaging confirms this - not one, but THREE small hernias, all three in my inguinal canal (the groove at the hip, where the leg meets the groin).  I make an appointment to have them surgically fixed.  Turns out, they can cause referred issues to the entire area, including the private parts, because they move the nerves in that area around.  And he tells me that as my body gets used to the hernias, the symptoms should subside.

Within a few days, the issues with the groin and testicle completely disappear.  But, BUT!!  A new issue arises.  Constipation.  Bad constipation, and an associated loss of appetite.  No matter how hard I try, I can't go to the bathroom.  And when I take a softener, all that comes out is a little bit of liquid.  Not pretty, I know.  But this constipation persists.  I feel full fast.  And this leads to a whole new round of Googling.  These are things I actually Googled:

* inguinal hernia and constipation
* can inguinal hernias paralyze the bowel
* symptoms of bowel \*\*ncer
* prostate \*\*ncer and hernias
* how MCAS affects the bowel

So there I am, with one issue solved, but another one happening.  I can't help but think that all of this is related by some bigger, unknown, deadly cause.  Are the hernias *really* causing these digestion issues?  My dad, noticing the worry on my face, hands me a book called ""Fiber Fueled"".  It has now been since May 8th that I had that video call with the doctor.  I flip to the index and read every page that mentions constipation.  I decide to follow the book's advice.  I start eating sauerkraut by the forkfull.  Daily probiotics, magnesium, and fiber.  Lots of fiber.  No dairy, six different fresh sources of fiber a day.  I've never eaten as many kiwis in my life.  I become a new owner of a squatty potty.  I'm desperate to poop again, starting to worry that I'll never have another normal BM in my life.  That dreaded \*\*ncer word keeps sounding off in my mind.  Not for the testicle this time, but for the bowel.

Last Wednesday, I start to feel really gassy.  Probably a good thing, I think.  It means something's happening down there.  Then, a poop.  A small poop, but a poop nonetheless.  Friday for lunch, my boss orders food.  I wolf down a Five Guy's cheeseburger like there's no tomorrow, and realize that my appetite is back.  Yesterday?  I wake up.  Coffee, feeling like a poo.  And I sit, and OH, THE GLORY!!!! WHAT A POOP!!! Followed by anoher one at lunch.  And another one, four hours later.  I'm releasing massive amounts of it, weeks of blockage.  It is a magical day.

And then this morning, I sit up in bed and realize....that the stress is gone.  That I feel happy.  That I *want* to eat breakfast.  I go to the gym, run five miles on the treadmill.  Eat a big lunch, no bloat.

I'm back.

And that's the story about how several unrelated things, and some bad timing, and some panic, led me down a very dark path for the last 2 1/2 months.  The eye thing?  Completely unrelated to everything else.  I just chose to have it sent to pathology right before my lower half went haywire.  Benign, like the pathology report had originally said.  The testicular/groin issue?  Three small hernias, that I probably got at the gym, and aggravated during a particularly labor intensive day at work (sometimes, I'm out in the field).  The constipation?  A gut imbalance, my intestines completely wrecked by the medications I took for the testicle issue, poor decisions that I made in a state of panic.  Medications that were completely unnecessary and did NOTHING but harm.  Medications that made me sore and suppressed my appetite.  A gut imbalance that was healed by some probiotics, prunes, patience, and kiwis.

And so, what I've learned is that if there's a simple explanation, and a simple path to follow, that is usually the right answer.  For me, thinking that I was dying (thanks, Google!) was really a few hernias and a simple case of disbyosis, healed by following the program in that book my dad handed to me.  The first time he told me ""you need to eat more fruits and vegetables"", I shrugged it off - I almost laughed at him.

""*What's going on here is way more complicated than that!""*

Turns out, it wasn't.  And all that stress, all that panic, all that worry that I've had since early May, was avoidable.  I made it worse by giving in to the anxiety, and by making brash decisions in the heat of the moment.

The mind is a very powerful thing.  Through a combination of anxiety and stress, I had *convinced* myself I was sick, so much so that I created a lump in my neck that was never really there. So much so that the stress in my body said hey, let's stop eating for a little while.  Let's lose a little weight.

So, the next time you're going through it, take a step back, breathe, stay off of Google, and remember that the human body is very, very good at solving its own issues.  Don't let the panic take over.  Drink water, eat healthy, sleep, and do the basics.  Breathe.",1752981364.0,170,26,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

1m3ncfc,Reversing/Opposite Focus,"Hey everyone! So like all of you lovely folks, I also have health anxiety, and my biggest coping mechanism with that is something I call “reversing”. It’s really super simple, but what I do is whatever body part I’m hyper-fixating on that is scaring the hell out of me (usually it’s my left arm or my head, since I’m terrified of things like heart attacks, strokes, etc. even though I’m very healthy/active…) 

Anyway, what I do is literally just focus on the OPPOSITE body part. Like literally put the fear in reverse and put it somewhere else in the body till it becomes clear that it’s just anxiety. 

Ex: if my left arm feels weird, I force myself to focus on the right arm, and eventually it’ll feel the same due to psychosomatic stuff, I can prove to myself it’s just anxiety. I hope this helps.

1m1r7ps,Avoiding triggers to deal with HA,"I tried my best with this post title, but it's still meh. Sorry about that lol :,)  
I think that a lot of people with HA can relate to me - I was really keen on reading and watching health content online. My whole FYP was flooded with videos about different illnesses, stories of those who had them, etc etc etc. I thought of it as ""educating myself just in case"" and ""being aware to catch it early"", but it's fairly obvious that it's just a compulsatory behavior.

I was consuming more and more of that content and meanwhile my anxiety was consuming more and more of myself - so one day I got fed up and muted a fair share of it. Muted Reddit communities, added banned words to Instagram, unfollowed quite a bit of accounts and persistently ignored triggering stuff that still managed to get through all that.

I got better after doing it, but I understand that I am just running from my fear and not getting desensitized as I should. But avoiding triggers \_for now\_ is obviously the best I could do. At the very least it's better than performing a compulsion on a daily basis.   
(To be honest, I also happen to find medicine generally interesting, but unfortunately my health anxiety prevents me from just observing it and not spiraling. It doesn't seem possible to separate my general curiosity from a HA thing at this point.)

Previously, we've been taking a default-deny approach. This means that any post has to have been approved by a human moderator, before it hit the subreddit.

The mod log is a very valuable tool, but not at all intended for this type of regular moderation style.

The new style is a default-approve, where any post that doesn't hit the filters gets through. I've tried my best to guide any reassurance seekers and symptom posters to the right mega thread with an extensive list of keywords.

That's just how life is, especially if you're not from some well-developed western European country.   
  
I \_wish\_ I could just trust my physician and move on, but again, it just doesn't work like that. Finding a good Dr (at LEAST a physician) is a big matter of luck, location, time and money, sometimes all that at once.   
I'm sure that most of the people here had this concern. What do you do and think about it?   
  
I thought of keeping on the attempts to spot a good physician for starters by just visiting different ones every time (I'm not from the States thus I'm dealing with a different system of healthcare), but my city is small and I'm pretty sure I'll meet all of the physicians here soon, and every time I'm disappointed... :/ ",1752600245.0,41,24,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

I’m not looking for advice or to give any. I’d really just love to listen to your story. What your journey has been like, how it started, how you’re coping, and how things are going for you now. If you’re comfortable sharing, I’d be grateful to hear about it in DMs and maybe ask a few questions along the way.

I’m trying not to spiral but I feel so defeated. I’m afraid I have something.

1lzb0jv,How to bring up concerns to doctor? I don't want to seem attention seeking or overly anxious.,"I've been having some symptoms that are consistent with a rare disease. I've been visiting the doctor fairly frequently to get to the bottom of some symptoms and follow up with some other stuff, but each visit, I get too embarrassed to bring up what I'm actually anxious about. I'm afraid of looking like an attention seeker, or like one of those ""doctor google"" people who think they know better than their doctor. I also am afraid my concerns won't be properly addressed/tested and I'll still be left wondering if I have this disease.

I know I need to talk to my doctor about it because I just can't stop wondering about what my future will look like if I have this disease, and I feel like this kind of limbo just isn't sustainable.

There's also a free test that a research lab offers, but I'm debating taking it. On the one hand, I would just *know*, but on the other hand, I don't know how I would handle a positive result if I got one, especially having to bring that to my doctor and explain that I did a mail-in test from the internet lol.

1lz3kj1,A song that helps me cope,"Ever since I had a rare, life-threatening illness (twice!) as a child, I’ve been a huge hypochondriac, hyper aware of every sensation in my body and always catastrophizing about what it could possibly be. Over the years, I’ve thought I’ve had everything, from aneurysms to flesh eating bacteria, all because I felt a slight sting in my head or because my skin looked a bit flaky. It got particularly bad in my mid twenties when I started having severe panic attacks—not only did I think I MIGHT die at any minute from some terrible disease, I KNEW I would die, any second now. I stayed up at night for days, constantly monitoring my pulse for any changes. I avoided going to the bathroom for as long as I could because I didn’t want to be found dead on the toilet. And when you spend such a long time KNOWING you’re going to die at any minute, it brings on quite a terrible existential crisis 😓. But that’s for another time. I’ve been better since, and one thing that’s helped me is being able to laugh at myself when my brain starts getting carried away. I wrote this song, which makes me feel better, so I wanted to share it with this community, in the hopes that if any one else has experienced what I have, it makes you feel better too:

I can't believe how good I feel because the ""imbalance sensation"" are gone when I am not paying attention to it. Though I still have other sensations and are struggling with other things.

  
Basically, to deny or confirm if you really have something concerning, the first step is paradoxically not to worry about it. Because the anxiety itself can create realistic feelings indistinguishable from genuine concerns, and you will never know if you have a real concern if you can't stop being anxious first.

Yes this is ridiculous. Yes this makes no sense. I have done tons of research finding that the probability of a mouse even becoming rabid is infinitesimally small, much less me coming into contact with one. Hospitals don't even give rabies shots for rodent bites because of how low the risk is.

And yet, here I am, 2 days after. I haven't slept, I can't eat. I keep running this stupid situation in my head, and its exhausting me. This is a common occurrence for me. Despite multiple anxiety medications and therapy visits, I always do this. How do I stop? I am so tired of spending my life afraid. Have any of you managed to break free?

Also I am sure that I have somehow screwed up where/if I was supposed to post this. I am just so tired and have found no solace in any other subreddits/forums. I understand if you want to berate me for that, but if you can even give me the smallest sliver of advice while doing so I would appreciate it.

Edit: I truly appreciate you all sharing advice as well as your own experiences. I am doing a bit better now, I have tried incorporating some of the practices mentioned in this thread and they have helped.

1lvrhvq,Psychologist's advice for me and you.,"So, I've been going through a medical whirlwind, and I cry about it to my psych often. Here's what she said. Rules of thumb, if you will.

Googling is bad, especially in specific side effects and symptoms! Because it compiles EVERY possible aspect, especially meds side effects! (because companies have to list them.) Google also isn't likely to take the rareness of these symptoms and side effects into consideration either. You likely read things that a FRACTION of people experience but of course Google compiles all of it. She said to me... weigh the chances, possibilities and operate with occam's razor in mind. Essentially, it is lacking nuance.

About Reddit. When you research things, anecdotal evidence is usually not as impartial right? When people come to Reddit, they are coming with specific symptoms usually in SPECIFIC subreddits... essentially it is going to become a cycle of confirmation bias, once you start looking up your specific symptoms on reddit. This is what happened to me with the CUTI community, which I had to mute for my own sanity... She said, that mild things most likely won't have dedicated subreddits or posts with high engagement rates.

Most importantly, people who heal, get better and don't experience complications, are NOT LIKELY TO POST ON REDDIT! Of course you feel terrified of the illness you might or might not have because you are only reading negative stories and experiences. Look up success stories. If you really need advice, seek out doctors. If that is expensive, like it was for me so many times, people working at pharmacies are also available for questions and can give supplements/suggestions for medications. I did this when I in fact was diagnosed but was still experiencing weirdness mid treatment. :-)))) 

So, 1: Google isn't nuanced. 2: Reddit is biased. 3: DON'T keep yourself guessing, you are not a professional and you WILL spiral.

My psychiatrist advised to keep reminding myself of my own anxiety. I am constantly on high alert, and I am certain you guys are too. Before distractions, remind yourself of your hyper-vigilance. 

Stay calm, give any symptoms time. The body is INCREDIBLY complicated. Mom always says: It's really hard to die. True! She was attacked by a panther at her old job at a Zoo at age 21. Still alive and kicking! If the symptoms subside, the body is bodying. 3-4 days in, doctor. You will be okay.

The average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**

This means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.

* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where ""marinating in the positive"" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).
* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.
* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).
* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.
* Declaration of living life in the ""here and now"", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.
* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: ""being perfect"" vs ""being good enough"").

If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the ""update post"" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap.

* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where ""marinating in the positive"" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).
* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.
* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).
* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.
* Declaration of living life in the ""here and now"", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.
* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: ""being perfect"" vs ""being good enough"").

1hpszy0,Social media and algorithms are making it so much worse ,"I’ve noticed recently that Facebook and Instagram are flooding me with medical posts, (I won’t mention specifics). Every day I see stuff from the CDC, news articles talking about different illnesses, videos of people in the hospital, videos of people with medical issues.

At first it was simple stuff like “wash your hands.” And I clicked it, that’s how it got me. Now, I can’t open any of them without being flooded. 

There’s a lot of talk about how social media is bad for mental health, but I never considered this facet of it. I relentlessly say “not interested” and the like, but it won’t stop. It’s like even that level of interaction is telling it that I want this. I don’t. I had my HA under control overall until this happened. And shy of deleting all of my socials, I can’t find a way to make it stop.

I guess the point of this post is to say, no matter how small a post may seem, if it seems medical related be very careful not to interact with it if you have bad health anxiety, because the algorithm doesn’t care how bad it’ll send you spiraling.

1hpqyxp,AI is the single best thing for health anxiety,"Hear me out. I have always had awful health anxiety where I get pulled into the internet spiral of doom. AI has helped me so much with this. I use ChatGPT 4o, so I’m not sure about the simpler models, but basically for any worry, I outline the concern, I explain I’m concerned, and then I ask for odds on what the cause is. 

I could be wrong, but I assume other worriers are also fairly analytical and are helped by seeing odds repeatedly for reassurance.  

With AI, you can get the answers you need to those ridiculous questions only we think about. For example, I recently learned that I’d used non food grade tubing on a reverse osmosis system.  It was only a couple of feet, but I began to freak out about chemicals. Using AI, I was able to do ridiculously tedious things like determine the possible chemicals, the risks, the actual water amount that might have sat in the tube (.3 ounces), and learned probably far too much about how tube classifications work.

I have found a way to stop googling all the time by making it more difficult for myself. However, I am still checking my body a lot and it is like a compulsion.

I really struggled through the summer and beginning of fall this year with health anxiety and these modules were the only thing to actually help. 

I haven’t actually completed the workbook yet, but whenever I start feeling anxious I open them up and work on them, and it redirects my thoughts. It’s really helped me reframe my health anxiety because for ages I felt completely out of control of my thoughts.

1h7z2cx,I think my friend has severe health anxiety; I don't know what to do...,"One of my closest friends, who I've known for about six years, is someone who I believe has health anxiety. He has always been quite prone to seasonal colds and flus and has also suffered with other types of anxiety. Each week he seems to believe he has a different illness, from long covid, lymes disease, always believes he has a cold, heart problems, food intolerance, allergic reactions, dermatological conditions etc etc etc. Over the past two years I would guess that he has told me he suspects he is suffering with about thirty different illnesses. He has gone for many, many different diagnostic tests which have come back clear to my knowledge. It also seems alot of his symptoms are environmental. For example he will stay up until 4am and then say the next day that he has fatigue from being ill again. 

My issue is that when I have tried to gently put across to him that he may have health anxiety he gets extremely defensive and upset, and says I'm undermining and dismissing him. I go between thinking his illnesses are genuine and feeling extremely bad and then thinking that it really is anxiety and that the worst thing I could do is feed into it by affirming how he feels.

I've had HA for about 20 years and when it's bad it's completely disabling. Like right now. I know not to google, I'm pretty sure most of us know it's the worst thing for us to do, but my problem is I literally cannot stop myself. It's 100% a compulsion, to the point where if I \*don't\* google my symptoms, I can have a panic attack because, in my mind, I might be missing some vital, potentially life-saving piece of information and that will result in a worse outcome. Logically I'm aware how insane that is, but I'm pretty sure I have ADHD and OCD in addition to GAD and HA, and I think my neurological wiring is just ... bad. Like it was put in by an unqualified electrician. I don't know how to beat the compulsion.  
  
So - what do you guys do to prevent yourselves googling? What works for you? I'm desperate and would really appreciate any suggestions I can try.

1h6cdn4,Exercising with HA,"Hi reader! 

How do you all handle exercising with health anxiety? I know and understand all the benefits - from improved mood, better clarity to literally actively fighting what I'm terrified of - illness and early death. 

But all the ""symptoms"" of exercising are basically like giving myself a personal panic attack. Increased heart rate, feeling dizzy and short of breath, feeling fuzzy and lightheaded, feeling faint, etc. And all of this immediately spirals me straight from exercise to a panic attack and I need to leave. 

I've been loving reformer Pilates recently and went 4-5 times a week, finally having found an exercise that just worked and made me feel great! But then anxiety showed it's evil head, as it likes to do, when I'm finally better off, and I had a massive panic attack during class. I've since then only been back once with a friend for support and that was still a struggle and it makes me so incredibly sad and frustrated. 

How do you navigate exercise? Maybe especially group exercise?  I was so humiliated having to stop and leave class early. The teacher was super kind, but I felt like such a loser..  Any tips appreciated. I already eat and drink plenty before going to avoid blood sugar issues and drink electrolytes through the workout which does help some, but not enough!

The average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**

This means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.

* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where ""marinating in the positive"" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).
* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.
* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).
* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.
* Declaration of living life in the ""here and now"", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.
* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: ""being perfect"" vs ""being good enough"").

1guknb0,My advice after getting (mostly) cured from hypochondria through psychological aid (CBT) for five months. ,"I had health anxiety as my daily norm, and the worst thing about it was that i started some kind of loop. I would worry about my heart, and then I'd get heart palpiations, and sometimes (when at its worst) something that felt like irregular heartbeats. I would then worry about having heart problems and heart attacks. I was put on a medication (anti-histamine), to ease these heartbeats so that I would be abled to sleep, as I would have palpitations for multiple hours before somehow falling asleep. 

When I first came in to meet my psychologist I had a plan set up, filled with things that I did not believe in first; Imaginary Exposure, Physical exposure - and the difference between watching and observing. 

If you are not abled to meet a psychologist, I would recommend reading into these and learning how to do different exercises surrounding them. I'm going to give a brief description of these words and my exercises, but I would also like to start by saying that I am in no way an expert, and will only be writing from my experiences. 

  
1. Watching vs observing

This is something that everyone with health anxiety does, and it is also something that increases symtoms. I still struggle with this a bit, and it is the last thing holding me back. I started getting heart palpitations for the first time in almost two months last week by wathcing a video by Dr. Mike, where he started speaking about heart problems, at the same time as I was doing an exercise that had my pulse up. This made me go from a state of observing any potential symtoms I would have in my heart (like most people do), to watching for a symtom, which is the worst thing you can do. 

My exericise here was to lie for a minute and focus only on breathing, then one minute on a symtom I've been struggling with, to then focus on something in my room. This should be done in silence, and the first two parts has to be done with your eyes closed. When breathing, you should try your hardest, not to hyperfocus on a symtom. 

I did two sets of four reps of this every day.

2. 

Imaginary exposing.

This is where the biggest difference happened. Your objective is to make a chart, and then write down the worst possible scenario, for me it was to get sarcoma, being unable to be cured, and slowly fading away from life, leaving my parents behind in tears, and missing the future I had in front of me. I would then spend 10-20 minutes making a story in my head of this happening. The most important step of this is not neutralizing your thoughts. You are not to think ""this is unlikely"". 

  
This was horrible to do in the beginning, and as someone who barely cries - this did the job. That also means that i was abled to cry on command, like an actor lol. The tears stopped after many days of doing this, and it became easier to do. This led to me being abled to handle this fear with way more control. My psychologist compared this to a scary movie. It might be very scary the first time. But if you watch it 30 times, it won't be scary.

  
3. Physical exposing

This exercise consisted of mostly doing things that simulate different symtoms. One was to wear a tight shirt (thyroid things), one was two run up staris for a couple of minutes (heart palpitations-ish) or to breathe through a straw (difficulty breathing). You can create challenges depending on who you are. I did these different things over and over again until I no longer felt any anxiety connected to this one thing. It worked really well.

  
These things might not help you, but it really helped me - and if you haven't visited a psychologist because you are too afraid to, do it! It is a big regret that I did not do it earlier. ",1731977238.0,249,33,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

The average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**

This means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.

* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where ""marinating in the positive"" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).
* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.
* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).
* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.
* Declaration of living life in the ""here and now"", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.
* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: ""being perfect"" vs ""being good enough"").

1gcwwe3,Fighting Health Anxiety with Math & Bayesian Reasoning (Rare Diagnoses and Medical Neglect Fears),"I most recently got so sick of my health anxiety, but still couldn’t fight the urge to check, look up diagnoses, and overall fear the worst. 

So I decided to use 4o to break this down into mathematical understandings I could grapple with.

I asked it what was the likelihood of another nuclear war since the 1940s. It gave me a conservative estimate of .5%. On the other hand, the statistical anomaly of you being misdiagnosed or neglected for your suspected medical condition is, conservatively, 0.005%.

This means that, on average, 1000 nuclear wars would have to have passed before you were actually misdiagnosed. The variance within one to two standard deviations does not significantly weigh the severity in either direction either. After all, we have people concerned about a FIRST nuclear war, not the 1000th. 

I am not trying to ridicule any of your math abilities, and I implore you to still seek medical attention if you have not done so nor have been cleared of anything extremely concerning. But hopefully this gives you some reassurance into your condition - more specifically, the lack thereof. ",1729982489.0,68,13,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

1g5ctj2,Seeking Advice on Supporting Someone with Health Anxiety,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for advice on how to support a loved one who I believe is struggling with health anxiety. They frequently talk about symptoms and are constantly wanting to get checked out, even after multiple reassurances from medical professionals that nothing is wrong. This has been going on for years, and it’s taken an emotional and financial toll. They haven’t been working and spend most of their time in bed, researching symptoms online and watching videos—habits that I worry are only making things worse. Though they’ve been encouraged to try things like taking walks or meditating, they agree but never follow through.

While I want to remain supportive and understanding, I’m struggling to find the balance between being there for them and setting healthy boundaries. How can I respectfully and firmly steer conversations away from health concerns, especially when they become repetitive? We’ve gently discussed the possibility that this might be a mental health issue, but they seem fixed on the idea that something else is wrong. They’re now planning to travel to get more tests, as local doctors won’t refer them for any additional ones.

I’m not sure if or when I should be more firm in telling them that they likely aren’t physically ill and that the discomfort they feel may be self-induced.

If anyone has been in a similar situation or has suggestions on how to encourage them to seek appropriate help, I’d really appreciate your advice. Thank you!",1729120239.0,1,5,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

Seeing a post, some news, a poster, hearing a conversation about the illness you are afraid of does NOT mean it’s ‘a sign’ that you are really suffering with this illness.


It’s exactly like when you get a car, and suddenly you start seeing that same make of car everywhere. It’s just self awareness, you’re seeing it out, the stats have not changed.


For example, seeing a lot of posts about ‘The big C’ does not mean it’s some sort of divine sign that you are terminally ill.


These things aren’t prophecies. When things are on your mind, you will find things to do with them. It’s not the heavens above trying to give you some holy warning or some shit.

1fwyduf,OCD Looks like Health Anxiety!,"I’ve personally had OCD for 8 years and was misdiagnosed with generalized anxiety around health worries multiple times. It’s frustrating because **the treatment for anxiety and OCD is NOT the same.** In fact, regular CBT can often make OCD symptoms worse.

If you're constantly having intrusive fears but know they’re irrational, and it’s causing you to ruminate a lot or avoid certain situations, it could honestly be OCD. Especially if you tried regular therapy already like I had.

My tips on what worked for me -

* \[Definitively the best choice\] -> Go see a therapist or psychiatrist who specializes in OCD; they can tell you whether or not you’re in the right place. 
* You can take a YBOCS quiz (one of the clinical scales for measuring severity of OCD) and see if the questions resonate with you. [Here’s a link ](https://www.thecalculator.co/health/Yale-Brown-Obsessive-Compulsive-Scale-(Y-BOCS)-Calculator-921.html)to one I’ve used in the past 
* You can talk to an [AI chatbot like this one](https://TheMangoHealth.com) to ask more questions about OCD and see if you’re symptoms line up.

Since October is OCD Awareness Month, I wanted to share this for anyone who might feel stuck or confused about their mental health. **You’re not alone.**

PS - If you already know you have OCD and have a similar story of getting the right diagnosis after being misdiagnosed, feel free to share. Your story could help someone else!",1728156901.0,3,2,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

1ftnec6,Health Anxiety - Things that have worked for me,"

I struggled with HA for over 20 years. However, the last two years I find that I have been doing really well. I have tried many things over the years from Therapy, Meditations, breaking down my thinking patterns, taking my thoughts to court, and cognitive behavior therapy.

Things that I have found worked well:

1) Do not google symptoms, websites are designed to keep you on them... how do you keep engagement? By feeding people's fears. When I had the urge to google, I did a meditation or hard exercise.

2) If my body has a weird symptom, I would give it week to 10 days before I would book a doctors appointment. I became aware that our bodies have sensations and have accepted that these sensations are normal. Try this experiment - Think about your big toe on your right foot. Really focus on it.... do you notice tightness? maybe some slight pain or a funny feeling? Our brains have enormous power, and hyper-fixation does cause physical symptoms. 

3) Meditate daily - Even if its only 15 minutes. Use a Montra. I use ""I am healthy, negative thoughts are not facts"" I say it over and over while beathing in and out deeply.

4) Take your thoughts to court. How many times have you been wrong about your illnesses? Over the years I have convinced myself that I have had over 20 terminal illnesses and many autoimmune conditions. After many medical tests and physicals, I have always been wrong. Its unlikely that you will diagnose yourself correctly by reading and not performing proper diagnostics with no formal training.

- I realized that I was having confirmation bias, I would latch on to the symptoms and make them fit a condition while ignoring the facts that proved me wrong. What's the chance that 4 different doctors would miss something, and all blood labs would be incorrect? Possible but highly unlikely. 

5) I now schedule a yearly physical and trust the results. This gives me my baseline health and my doctor can monitor for any changes. Now that I started to believe that I am in good health and try to take care of my body, magically the weird sensations have subsided.  Anxiety can cause physical symptoms and it's amazing what you can convince yourself is true.

  
6) I realized that the worry was destroying the thing I was trying to preserve (life). You want to ""catch"" the illness to prevent sickness or death, so you are constantly googling, seeking reassurance, go to endless appointments and have endless tests only to start at the beginning. Living in your head is not living life, I was making my life miserable trying to preserve it when all the real evidence was showing me that I was not in health danger. I started to try and really live in the moment, discard of the automatic negative thoughts and take deep breaths. The more I practiced, the pathways and my brain changed, and the anxiety came less often. 

I still have the occasional flare/spiral, but they don't last as long, and they don't trigger the same level of anxiety and depression that I have had before. 

Feel free to message me if you want to talk more and hoping you can start moving towards recovery.

for context, I''m seeking this on my wife's behalf. She needs social media for work and gains a lot of fulfilment from sharing memories with friends and family on social media as well. I don't think it's feasible for her to block it entirely. 

She has OCD and GAD, with a fixation on health issues, as well as terrorism amongst other things. 

Social media and news websites are huge influence on what she worries about and how much distress that worry causes. In particular, algorithm driven platforms like tiktok and reels drive triggering content to her and naturally don't recognise that her engagement with this content is hurting her. She can lose hours to ""researching"" one thing or another and this often includes panic attacks. She works from home often and experiences things most acutely when I am out at work myself.

A great lesson that I learned is to not do any testing yourself. I have tried to get some reassurance by performing some easy to perform tests to self diagnose/rule out certain diseases. Guess what, this is a rabbit hole: it only made my HA worse as now I have another ritual to perform lol.

My advice for today is: don’t ever do self test. Here are the few reasons:

1) We often don’t have any professional knowledge to understand the context and the intended usage of a test, so the prerequisite of the test may not be satisfied. 

2) We don’t know the proper procedure to perform a test.

3) We don’t know the threshold of positive or negative and how it should be associated with other factors like age etc. 

4) And we don’t know how to interpret tests: Each test has its sensitivity and specificity, and a set of tests often need to be combined to show any significance. 

So if you are really obsessed with a particular self-found test, talk to your doctor who really can educate you, and forget about this test and move on. Next time, if you see anyone advocating some tests and claims that you can do at home, ignore that and continue your life.

1fd64yj,My health anxiety arises not from any complaints I have healthwise but because social media shows it like everyone has C,"I don’t know if this makes any sense but my absolute biggest fear is getting some type of C and it’s not because I experience any symptoms. It’s because:

1- I know it’s confirmation/selection bias (or whatever they call it) for the most part that we see a slew of posts/news/threads about people dealing with C (like Kate Middleton) but it’s still disquieting as hell and makes it look like half the population is fighting for their lives.

2- This one is more concerning as almost everyone knows of someone or multiple someones in their lives who were diagnosed/passed away from that damn disease and it’s even worse when it’s someone’s mom/dad/sibling/child etc. Like you check out the statistics and it’s not THAT common but then you hear (or worse yet witness) all these horror stories and it’s just like gasoline to the fire. 

Does anyone else go through something similar? I know this sub talks more about symptoms and stuff but for me it’s basically exposure to the outside world that ups my health anxiety to eleven.",1725931445.0,27,15,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

The average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**

This means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.

* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where ""marinating in the positive"" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).
* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.
* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).
* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.
* Declaration of living life in the ""here and now"", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.
* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: ""being perfect"" vs ""being good enough"").

1f5f6s0,Let’s break down what actually causes it.,"1) Fear
2) Thoughts
3) Thinking ahead of yourself
4) Whats ifs
5) i might

I want to begin with this legendary quote. Whenever my fear starts to take control of my body, I screenshot it.

  "" once you accept death, you stop fearing "" 

So, what actually causes it? What makes you keep searching for answers about your body? It’s your fear, and it’s your thoughts trying to take control of your body.

Now lets move on to how your body precieves more negative emotions than positive ones 

  Our brains tend to perceive negative emotions more intensely than positive ones, a phenomenon called negativity bias. Negative stimuli capture more attention and are processed more deeply than positive ones. Research shows negative events have a greater impact on our psychological state and memory, leading to stronger emotional responses. 
 

The question is how you can take control of your brain and body. First, you have to realize that every instinct and every action is directly related to your body. Your body and mind work together seemingly. What you feed your brain is a direct link to your body, and it’s true. This is how people with health anxiety would describe it.

I have every health anxiety imaginable. Sometimes, I describe it as a combination of social anxiety, performance anxiety, health anxiety, waking up anxious and nervous, feeling like impending doom, panic attacks, a bloated stomach, and feeling like I’m in constant pain. I can’t eat properly, I’m underweight, and all of this is happening despite the fact that I haven’t died yet. Why is that? Because you’re only fearing your death, which is the root cause. You haven’t accepted the fact that you will die eventually, and all of this will eventually matter less. So why fear it? Why live in fear that is absolutely temporary and in a world that is not permanent? So get up, soldier, and start living. Don’t fear it; enjoy it.

For example, I told my dermatologist, and I now have a once a month standing appointment. If I find something on my skin, I have to wait until my appointment rather than schedule an emergency one. This is important, so that your physical health is safe guarded, but that the situation is treated primarily as a mental health issue.

One moment I want to beg my doctor to order an MRI, and the next I’m negative self talking myself that I’m tricking my body to feel this way. How do you balance the two?

1e58tgo,Comforting reminders I wrote about HA,"Hi all, so, I wrote these reminders for myself in my notes app during the beginning of the year when I had a bad health scare at the ER. Now, going back to it when I have an ongoing health scare reminds me about how many times I have gone through this, and how many times I have also overcame it. Hopefully, anyone who sees this can find comfort and solace in these words if you are in a difficult situation. I am with you! ❤️

1. You are in control of how you are feeling. All these sensations that you are feeling now are all sensations you have felt before with anxiety, and it is nothing more than that. If in any case it is, there are always people/resources that can help you, like going to the ER where they are equipped to handle situations like these. It is not the end of anything and you will be okay.
2. Your mind can manifest just as many physical symptoms as a normal sickness can. Anxiety can cause a plethora of symptoms that have nothing to do with actual sickness. There are lists of physical symptoms anxiety can cause and can fool you into believing that something is wrong.
3. Think of the safest place you can be, mentally. Try to see if any of the symptoms gradually disappear over time once you start to relax your pacing mind. Think of all the safe places that your mind can go to (your bedroom, for example. A favorite person? A pet? Your family?) 
4. Know that anxiety is merely temporary feelings. Even though it feels like the end of the world, you have gone through these emotions and you WILL get through it just as you did every moment before.
5. Try to think of similar situations you might’ve been in where your health anxiety spiked before. Notice the sensations in your body, have they happened before? And did I turn out okay in the end? For me, it helps to think about all the times where I was convinced that something was wrong.. when it was just my mind playing tricks on me (don’t let your mind win).
6. Though you may be tired like I am now, when you feel like it never will end, understand that things will get better. It is hard to get rid of certain thoughts and feelings that never spiral, and I am sure that it is exhausting. I know it’s tough to stop the Google rabbit hole, but remind yourself that you are strong, you have been through this before, and there is a light at the end of the tunnel!

1e37gv3,"PSA: If you're on this sub, there's a good chance your health anxiety is actually a form of OCD. ","I post this every now and then because I was in a very dark hole with my health anxiety. I had some very real health problems I was dealing with, but my anxiety made them feel like life sentences. I could barely function, and was desperate for help.



I noticed that any normal ""anxiety""-based therapies did not help my health anxiety. If anything, they worsened it. Stuff like meditation, talking about it, writing about it, etc. It made my anxiety far worse. I knew that OCD ran in my family and I had small compulsions in my life, but I didn't realize that there is something called Pure-O.  Turns out, that's what I have!

Basically, this type of OCD means you have compulsions and rituals (much like washing your hands) but they're all mental. For us with health anxiety, that means you might have an intrusive thought about your health and will immediately need to ""cleanse"" your mind by googling or asking someone for reassurance. Do you notice that you feel some relief, temporarily, but then the thought comes back and usually stronger after some time? That's OCD. That's the exact feeling someone has when they feel the need to constantly wash their hands. They just *need* to clean their hands physically, the same way you *need* someone to tell you that you're going to be ok, or you *need* to just find that one article that will tell you exactly what you want to hear and alleviate your fears.

Luckily, treating OCD is simple though difficult to achieve. You can look into Exposure and Response therapy and all the other OCD therapies, but really it comes down to this - don't act on your thoughts. Don't create secondary thoughts from them. Definitely don't google or ask for reassurance. Just let your thought come into your head, and immediately try to focus your attention elsewhere. Don't even try to force the thought out. Any type of ""interaction"" with the thought isn't going to help. Just let it stay there, and eventually, it'll leave.  This is the basis of ERP which is the gold standard for OCD treatment.  It's very difficult to do on your own, so I recommend finding a specialist if you can.  However, I did a ton of work on my own that was immensely helpful, so it's possible.

It feels difficult at first, but over time you'll have a ton of practice. I still have good days and bad days, but my bad days are few and far between whereas they were 90% of my waking life before.

1e16xxq,Why do we think a horrible disease will hapen to us ?,"Hey all, hope you're doing great. I just came back from the optometrist, who reassured me that I just have some visual floaters and that my retina isn't detaching. I'm not going blind (can't believe I even convinced myself that was probable at 27 just because of eye floaters). Anyways, I was doing some thinking and was wondering if any of you felt similarly.

Do you guys feel like this whole anxiety about something being wrong with us, us being sick, or having a horrible fate or disease comes from a place of guilt, self-hatred and low self-worth? As if we believe deep down on some subconscious level that we deserve pain, suffering, and a miserable condition that leads to a miserable end?

I know for sure that, having grown up with religious trauma, there's always a feeling of guilt whenever something bad happens. It feels like a punishment from God, as if it's because of something I did to upset Him, and now I'm paying for it. I feel like, for me at least, that definitely has something to do with it. I feel deep down that I don't deserve good things, health, happiness, or stability. Something wrong just has to happen. I am more used to stress and unhappiness anyway, so that is more of my natural state.

And don't get me started on feeling guilty for enjoying pleasure (STD paranoias all the damn time). It seems like God certainly doesn't want me to have a good time and will punish me hard for enjoying my body.

1dtcc3k,Let’s talk about health anxiety,"

Let’s pretend for a minute that your health awareness is like a home security system. It’s designed to let you know when there’s a real health problem that needs your attention. But what happens when this system is too sensitively tuned and reacts to every little trigger?

With health anxiety, your body’s alarm system sets off the alarm for every day, common, and not dangerous occurrences and that can lead to *constant* worry.  Imagine a security system that goes off every time a leaf falls or a car drives by, it would drive you crazy after a while! In a similar way, when your health anxiety is heightened even regular things like a little ache, cough, or palpitation can set off that big alarm. This heightened state of awareness and alert can be mentally exhausting because you’re bracing yourself for a major health crisis that ISN’T there. 

Figuring out what triggers your health anxiety alarms is a very important step to overcoming them. Is it because you fell down a Google rabbit hole? Is it because you’re doomscrolling on Reddit? Or could it be a new symptom or feeling you felt? By pinpointing those triggers, we can start to figure out which alarms are caused by real health issues and which ones are those false alarms. 

Once you figure out those triggers, you can start refining how that alarm system responds. Put down your Apple Watch and blood pressure cuff and stop constantly checking your vital signs (I struggle with this too), and set a specific time of day to check them, such as once in the morning and once in the evening. GET OFF OF GOOGLE!!! Knock down the amount of time you spend online looking up and researching symptoms, because you’ll end up convincing yourself that you have the thing you’re reading about, and by reducing this you’ll reduce the amount of stress you put on yourself. 

Once you get your alarm system recalibrated, you can relax a little knowing that it’ll alert you when there’s really something to worry about! It’s about finding that sweet spot where you can enjoy life without the unnecessary worrying. 

Remember that managing your health anxiety is super important, but also remember to seek out medical help any time you’re genuinely concerned about your symptoms. 

NEVER FEEL EMBARRASSED OR HESITATE TO TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR!!!!!

As a paramedic I’ve ran my fair share of health anxiety related 911 calls, it’s literally what we’re here for, and you deserve the care, empathy, and compassion that healthcare workers can give to you.

The average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**

1dne8tw,"Everytime panic/anxiety is approaching, it is an opportunity to teach your body that it's not dangerous","When something triggers your body and it starts freaking out just feel it, accept it and know that it's not dangerous. Look at it as an opportunity to heal, rather than something bad to be avoided. You then program your body to understand that there is no danger, for if there were actual danger then surely the mind would act as if there were danger also. When the mind acts as if all is well, even though the body is freaking out, then the body will eventually calm down and learn that all is well.

Don't try and distract yoursel or hide from the triggers, that only signals to your body that there is actual danger. Don't react. Respond. All is well. You will recover. This is the process. It may take some time, but it works. Honestly, just live your life like normal and you will eventually recover, probably without even noticing until you're already well again.

Also I want to add that for me, yoga, meditation, and exercise (escpecially outdoors) helps me a lot. I also think that a keto or zerocarb diet can help a lot to calm down the body. I'm also going to try out some calming nootropics, although I don't think it's at all nessecary, maybe it'll speed up my recovery and help with sleep.

I’m very concerned he has something more concerning going on and I don’t want to subject him to unnecessary tests but I can’t let it go.

1ddwbwg,Can HA be caused by emotional neglect as a child?,"Whenever I had a health concern as a child my parents would just brush it off and tell me I was being dramatic.

I feel like the lack of acknowledgement or support could have caused me to develop hyper vigilance around health/ symptoms as a coping mechanism.

Idk how to explain it but the anxiety of not being supported by my parents made me feel like I had to do it all alone. 

I didn’t want to be caught off guard so I had to be suspicious of every symptom and stay prepared for disaster by catching it early.

Maybe the real reason we don’t feel safe is because our parents never showed us we could rely on them to keep us safe.

The denial of our worries made them feel huge and unmanageable because even our parents couldn’t fix them.

The diseases don’t trigger me as much as the feeling of helplessness does.

1dc42aw,This is your friendly reminder that sleep is wonderful for health anxiety,"So I've been dealing with a period of worse health anxiety for over a month now, and the Number 1 Thing!!! that has helped me fight my way back to normalcy has been completely changing my sleep habits. Going to bed early, not eating right before bed, having a calming bedtime routine, getting 9+ hours of sleep if possible, etc. Stress can be soooo taxing on your body, and can make you ""notice"" even more symptoms if you don't let yourself rest and recover. I still have my rough moments, but I can tell I'm doing way better than a few weeks ago because I'm not running on fumes all the time. Also, in my specific case, the thing causing my anxiety was a muscle sprain, and those types of injuries heal better when you get enough sleep! So it's extra important lol. 
I know it's super tough to sleep well when you're focusing on how bad you feel, but you can practice and get better at it, trust me. Sometimes I have to take melatonin or put on soothing background noise to get to sleep, but once you do, that's the hardest part over. And noticing that I feel genuinely better after a few nights' sleep is pretty motivating!
Anyway, this community has been helping me get through a lot lately, so I hope you all have a wonderful day/night and are taking good care of yourselves <3 And get some sleep haha",1717966668.0,119,24,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

The average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**

This means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.

* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where ""marinating in the positive"" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).
* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.
* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).
* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.
* Declaration of living life in the ""here and now"", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.
* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: ""being perfect"" vs ""being good enough"").

If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the ""update post"" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap.

1d4zd5e,How do you break out of hyper awareness?,"Hello!

I have health anxiety and it’s the worst, as I’m sure you’ll all readily agree. But one of my biggest offenders that haunts me even on my best days is that I am stuck in an endless cycle of ✨ HYPER AWARENESS ✨. 

When I’m really anxious, being hyper focused on my symptoms makes sense, like if I’m being vigilant about my rapid, shallow breathing or profuse sweating. 

But when I’m at rest and calm and having a good day, I still will sometimes become suddenly fixated on a feeling or a symptom. Like “hmm this spot on my face seems kinda tingly or numb” and hours later I’m still thinking about it. Or “I think I feel lightheaded or dizzy?” And I think about it constantly and consistently to the point where I really become dizzy! 

I guess the purpose of my post is to see what others of you do to snap out of this hyper vigilance. How do you know if what you’re feeling is actually real or if it’s so thoroughly focused on that it BECOMES REAL? Do you have methods to share? I’d love to hear your answers so maybe I can stop creating more issues than I already have! ",1717171948.0,13,6,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

Which is weird because my actual healths anxiety  is stopping me from living my life properly too even though I wish I could just be normal and like my old self again.

I also can’t plan things in the future like vacations and big events now because I don’t know what will have happened to me by then or what new symptoms I could possibly get. I also find myself feeling like there’s no point in me being excited for anything, I’ll have thoughts like “I might be dead by then anyway so I better stop feeling happy” or I’ll see people my age on tiktok and be like “I’m so jealous I wish I was healthy like them” even though I probably am but my anxiety symptoms feel so paralysing and real to the point I feel like I’m not.

You will see there’s so many reasons and I guarantee it will show signs of a bad illness, it just reminds you google is very dramatic 


-focus on something else, play games, go outside, drink some water. Get your mind off of it, I like playing strategic games personally like chess!


-talk to your friends, when I have anxiety I always see if my friends want to play a game, it takes my mind off of everything.


-chew gum, try chewing the same gum every time, the taste will remind you of the time you were concerned over something but here you are now!


-listen to music 


-watch YouTube or something 


-exercise, especially cardio

1cp5kj4,Trigger word blocking advice.,"Hi all.

Long term HA sufferer here currently going through the most intense episode of my life. 

I know it's recommended not to use tiktok because of the triggers and algorithm but let's face it, we're addicted.

I had originally used the feature to block key words that trigger me but...it just didn't seem to work.

I eventually stumbled on the idea of including the hashtag# before the trigger word and it worked immediately!

Now whenever I come across a new trigger word I add both the root word and the #word to my blocked words and so far none of them have reappeared.

Now I've been going to the gym for almost a year now partly because I wanted to build muscle, but mostly to try and get my body used to having a higher HR where it's totally normal. For the most part it's fine, but even still after a year, if I stop after a hard set or hard run and notice my heart thumping in my head then it starts giving me anxiety, to the point where I've had to leave the gym early on multiple occasions to try and calm myself down.

Obviously the easy answer is to just not push myself hard at all, but I don't want to sacrifice body progress, it feels like I'm letting the anxiety win if I do that.

___

The average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**

This means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.

* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where ""marinating in the positive"" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).
* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.
* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).
* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.
* Declaration of living life in the ""here and now"", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.
* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: ""being perfect"" vs ""being good enough"").

**REGARDING ""journey updates"" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the ""update post"" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post.

1ccfojs,A solution that helped with my health anxiety.,"I have been having very bad health anxiety about small aches, pains, moles, etc for several weeks now (almost a month IIRC). I tried not googling symptoms, but I couldn't bring myself not to. It almost felt like I was ""in denial"" about obvious health concerns (which can all be explained away by allergies). So just not googling symptoms wasn't really an option for me.

Instead, what eventually ended up working as of a few days ago is what I have coined ""hypochondria procrastination"". What I do, is if I notice some unexplained issue (mildly upset stomach, minor headache, etc.) I tell myself ""I will google it tomorrow."" Or at some other specific time in the future. Naturally, being fucking stupid, I will forget to google it at that specific time in the future, and then end up not even thinking about it. If I DO remember, I just put it off again, but after a few hours the symptom I'm obsessing over usually goes away on its own (because it's from nothing dangerous, like most random aches and itches our body has).",1714008956.0,92,10,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
1c5efpu,How do you hold a healthy conversation on health concerns with those around you? ,"I have bad HA specially recently as there are few biopsies scheduled. As a result any flare ups or pains I attempt to correlated with potential diseases, which to no one’s surprise I always end up with diagnosing myself with incurable diseases.

I attempt to communicate with my family members and those who are close around me in attempt of someone to knock me back to reality, and mostly it does not turn out very well. 

E.g. With parents whose works in the medical field: it will go away soon, oh I use to have this too, I’m sure you can just self check on it 
With my partner: oh it’s just your bad habits causing these symptoms, just be healthier, just stop.

Which makes me wonder, how should people with HA communicate their concerns with those around them in a healthy manner so that the support is supportive or useful? Without bringing negativity around?

Seriously her strength was so inspiring and her determination to live in the present was beautiful. Anyways, she said her mantra was “not today” and though she was using it for what she was going through, it honestly really has been helping me the past week. When I start to worry about a potential health issue that could form, I stop myself and just say “not today.” It has helped me to cut my thoughts off and go back to living in the moment and realizing I am alive today and how beautiful that is. I have the kind of health anxiety that causes me to stress about the future often and what may happen.

1bxywyk,Meta Theory on Health Anxiety,"My theory is that we all know we will die in that we know all who is born dies. But we do not fear that happening in specific ways, unless we are taught to.  
For example all of those news stories - “Warning!! I found scary illness! Watch our report to learn more!!!” 

They make you really interested in those symptoms. They teach us or remind us, hey we can die, but if you just *always pay attention*  you won’t.  But that is not really true. We all die, and many people who do not experience health anxiety know this well. I believe those with health anxiety are struggling with anxiety in general, which can appear most prominently as health anxiety - checks. However, something deeper down is making them struggle with health anxiety.   

For me, I struggle to be myself so when I really think about it, my greatest fear is passing away suddenly without being myself to others. And if I can deal with that part first, I do accept that health is a cycle with ups and downs and sometimes terrible but unavoidable things happen. But for people in the Americas who see a dr every few years and can keep functioning, their illness was not preventable anyways. Just follow medical guidelines from large university systems and past that try to look deeper - what are you really bothered by? ",1712476450.0,17,5,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

1bx2avo,For those who live or had a chance to live in the Netherlands: Did you ever feel like the Dutch healthcare system is overwhelmingly triggering?,"
I've lived here for 5 years now, and I noticed my HA being at my highest in this country. A lot has to do with GP appointments being very.... Surface level.
And ofcourse everyone knows the ""just take paracetamol"" joke here.

Multiple times I had situations, where I had to beg them to do any tests, for issues that later turned out to be more problematic. Theres no prevention procedures either?! Atleast that I'm aware of. 
For example My bf is at risk for one disease, which may be hereditary. Both his father and grandfather suffered from it, so that puts him at high risk. Yet they brush it off and tell him ""ya, come in when you have signs""- which would most definitely be too late.

Is it just my experience or has anyone else found it to be a problematic and very HA unfriendly system in this country?

1bwa9id,Need advice about how to approach my wife about HA concerns ,"I’ve been married to my wife for five years, we have three kids in the ages 2-5 and ever since I met her she’s been concerned about death and sickness, not only relating to her but also about me and the kids. 

She often seeks medical attention in hospitals for things that I consider unnecessary. A pain in the back can easily get her to think that she has a life threatening disease. 

When we first started seeing each other I would listen and advice her to go see a doctor when she’s concerned but as I’ve learned with time, it doesn’t really help. 

With time I’ve been getting more blunt with her, suggesting that she has anxiety and that maybe she needs to go and see someone about it. 

Her reaction to this has been that she thinks I’m calling her a liar and that I don’t care for her health and that she thinks that I won’t care if there is actually is something wrong with her. 

I’ve told her countless times that my advice is strictly for her own benefit and that my fear is that if there is anything really wrong with her in the future I won’t be able to take it seriously because of all the false flags through the years. 

For anyone that has HA and are in relationships, have you had this problem and how have you guys dealt with it? How would you have liked to be approached about HA concerns from a close one. 

It’s also a concern for me that her concern for the kids health will make them anxious about their own health in the future and I really don’t want that to happen. ",1712295146.0,3,7,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
1bvwg9t,How I deal with HA in a positive and constructive way,"I am convinced that a body and a soul are two separate entities, although intertwined so tight that it's difficult to tell them apart.

Both entities are sophisticated beyond comprehension. Yet, we tend to sometimes oversimplify and treat them as being primitive and helpless.

I strongly believe that our mind and soul can positively influence our bodies, and have a first hand experience in proactively doing so - being successful most of the time.

I literally talk to my body as if I am talking to another person - with respect, but also with demands.

Many a times I stopped getting sick within 30 sec. You know the feeling - chills along your spine, nose getting stuffy. As soon as I feel this, I conduct a 30 sec self-intervention packed with inner energy, anger, and demands. 

I close my eyes, and visualize how I am projecting my inner (mental) energy as a bright light which goes through my spine, throat, nose. I move my hands as if they are the source of such energy. And such light is destroying whatever bad stuff is there. Technical details are not important - I let the body figure this out. 

I am partially angry and partially super demanding during these 30 sec periods. My attitude towards my body is this: ""Are you freaking kidding me? Get it over with! Get rid of this junk right way!"". Most of the time, symptoms are gone in 30 sec. If once is not enough, I do ii more than once.

There are other examples where I was successful - like headache, being overweight, knee pain. 

What also helps is just go for a casual walk and talk to myself, and find positive things and amplify them until it gets crystal clear in my mind that there is positive path forward.

The point I am trying to make is that each of us can exercise a lot more control over our bodies, which in turn gives us confidence to eliminate or at least mitigate whatever the symptoms and HA.

Take my approach as a template only, and maybe try to figure out what may help you personally if you try something similar. Believing in your own strength is key - because it is true.",1712259250.0,82,30,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

The average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**

This means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.

* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where ""marinating in the positive"" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).
* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.
* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).
* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.
* Declaration of living life in the ""here and now"", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.
* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: ""being perfect"" vs ""being good enough"").

If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the ""update post"" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap.

On the one hand, SM gives us access to information and doctor's platforms that empower us to learn more about ourselves and our health. Some social media influencers even discuss HA directly and offer practical advice. On the other hand, it can be overwhelming to be on your phone at 11pm before bed and see a post about someone's diagnosis experience. So, what has been your experience with social media and health anxiety?

As someone who specializes in HA, I've noticed some patterns within my practice and have my own theories but I am curious to hear from a broader audience.... 

For discussion: Did you notice a correlation to the onset of your HA and an experience with SM?

Thanks! (:

He told me that beginning to focus more on the how you can choose to respond to this anxiety instead of agonizing about why it is happening will help reduce stress and reduce this feeling of helplessness that you feel when you are worrying.

1b4nada,How I manage my health anxiety,"I’ve suffered from health anxiety for many years. I had a few rough episodes when my health anxiety first developed about 4 years ago, and this thread provided me with a lot of help when it was at its worst. Recently got back on reddit, and thought I would revisit and drop some things that have helped me manage over the years. 
1. Accept and release control. When I was in my worst episode, which lasted for months, I had seen multiple doctors regarding a specific condition I was fixated on. All of them told me that nothing was wrong, but it only provided me with temporary hits of reassurance. I was asking family members about it every single day. I soon became extremely emotional and felt like I was losing my mind. I came to a point where I exhausted all of my options and could not get any further reassurance. I remember this distinct moment where I said to myself that I simply don’t care anymore, and that if I have the condition then whatever. I released all control and accepted that if I do have the condition then fine, but I can’t suffer over it anymore. I stopped checking that specific part of my body and accepted that if I do have the condition then it’ll develop and I’ll eventually find out. Over time it got quieter and quieter until I forgot about it. I definitely did not have the condition and I was borderline psychotic in hindsight. I’ll never forget that moment as it was so liberating. I feel like so much health anxiety comes from this tight grip of control we hold over conditions we may or may not have. If it is possible to just accept and release that control it is so freeing. 
2. When I begin experiencing a new symptom, I take note of it and keep it to myself for 3 days before I ask anyone about it or make a doctors appointment. This has been so beneficial as I’ve found that my reassurance seeking was only feeding into my conditions. Nowadays when I get a new symptom I’ll usually either forget about it or it’ll go away within 3 days. If it persists after 3 days, i’ll allow myself to address it. 
3. No searching symptoms online under any circumstances. This one was the most difficult, as the uncertainty is what allows my mind to go wild, but the cost of the internet telling me I had severe conditions was even worse. There is so much misinformation online, and you’ll always get the worst case scenario.
P.S this is simply what I’ve learned works for me based on my personal experience. Everyone is not the same and you may have a different experience. I just wanted to share in case it may be helpful to anyone who took the time to read. Wish you well on your journey, it does get better.  ",1709382892.0,457,84,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

1aeq6pb,"Search Engines & Health Anxiety: Try to be more aware when you are falling into a rabbit hole created from cookies, a personalized search engine, personalized search results, and the algorithm.","Google and other search engines use a tool called “personalized search results” to help each person get results catered to what seems to be their interests and preferences, using an algorithm to find patterns in all the data from your browser.

Google and other search engines use data from frequently visited sites to create personalized search results. These personalized search results mean you might not be getting the most accurate information that exists, but rather the information which relates most closely to what you’ve accessed in the past, or whatever sites a particular search engine wants you to see based on relationships they have with different companies.

**That is why the rule of thumb when dealing with Health Anxiety is not to search things up related to the symptoms. The next time you feel the urge to search something up remember this:**

>1) Focus on the health anxiety instead of the symptom you are feeling (of course after you cleared everything up with your doctor).   
>  
>\--> Searching up 'How to deal with HA' or 'How to calm down from HA' instead of 'Found ABC, could this be XYZ'.  
>  
>\--> For some us 'searching' is a behavior that serves some type of function (ex: sensory, tangible, attention, or escape), and rather quitting cold turkey we can find a healthier functional alternative behavior to channel that input. 

**How to protect yourself from triggering your Health Anxiety on Google:**

I’m afraid my dreams will be some kind of “premonition” and that if i don’t act on them to try and prevent the negative outcome I will have missed an opportunity to save my family member. I have been ruminating on it all day.

Has anyone else experienced this and if so, how do you manage you anxiety? How were you able to convince yourself that everything was actually okay?

The average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**

This means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.

* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where ""marinating in the positive"" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).
* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.
* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).
* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.
* Declaration of living life in the ""here and now"", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.
* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: ""being perfect"" vs ""being good enough"").

I think health anxiety for me decreases when I focus my obsessive tendencies elsewhere, the more productive the better (such as creative hobbies, specific topics of interest, etc.)

What have you all noticed in your experience?

Edit: Some newish strategies for me in combatting hyperfixating are: 
1. Writing on a calendar 2 weeks in the future ""have symptoms persisted?"" This has helped me in that if in 2 weeks things have not gotten worse/they've improved I will not follow up on it. 
2. If I hyper-fixate on a different symptom, sometimes the other thing I'd noticed disappears. In a way this helps to remind me that I am likely fixating. 

Of course if things DO persist, getting checked out by a doctor is the next step. Also, I don't guarantee these strategies will work for you, but just writing them in case they can help somebody.

18kqy6c,How to stop health anxiety catastrophizing?,"I've been struggling with HA for so long, I don't even remember what life was like beforehand. I'm currently having a HA flare-up. 



I won't get into specifics as to why, but I'm stuck in a vicious cycle that goes like this:

""This symptom is bothering me. What if it's xxx? I should see a doctor.""

""Oh my god, what if it actually is xxx? I shouldn't go to the doctor because they'll just confirm it. So if I don’t go, then it's not real.""

""What if it IS real and then by the time I do go, it's too late to do anything, I'll die and I'll deserve it because I waited too long and I don't want to die! So I'll go to a doctor.""

""BUT what if it truly is xxx? No I won't go, I'm sure these symptoms are nothing anyway.""

And thus the cycle repeats...

I am so exhausted. I am paralyzed with fear. It feels like my mind is out to get me. Sometimes I try to think rationally, I try to think of what is the more likely explanation, but if there is even the tiniest sliver of chance that I could have xxx, my mind zeroes in on that and accepts that as the only possible reality. So by the time I'm ready to see a doctor I've already accepted my fate; there's just no way I don't have xxx, I'm doomed. Everything I have worked so hard to build in my life will have been for nothing. I'll lose everything. The other shoe will have finally dropped. 



The worst part is when I do end up seeing a doctor, I don't even trust the test results. I don't know why. I'm not in the medical field. I don't have an education in medicine, so why on earth would I know better than someone who spent over a decade on learning how to do this job? And yet, this fact doesn't stop the anxiety or the cycle. It's still with me all the time. It follows me like my own shadow. 


Every single time I have been so convinced that I have whatever illness, and every single time I have been wrong. Every time I wish I had just gone to the doctor sooner because then I could've ended my suffering earlier. But what would be the point? Because I know this cycle will just restart eventually with a new health concern. 



Does it get better? Will it ever go away? Is there some kind of toolkit that I don't know about that will help me feel less powerless to my own mind? I don't know how to keep living like this.",1702846329.0,112,143,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

18hf2ev,Reducing or stopping Caffeine intake will REDUCE your health anxiety by more than you think,"I speak to a lot of people with Health Anxiety and I notice a lot of people here, have an insanely high Caffeine and Sugar intake. Reducing this can actually stop a lot of health anxiety behaviours and symptoms, here is why; 

# What happens in our brain with Health Anxiety 

Our brains can be very stupid and illogical at times, they haven't evolved that much from thousands of years ago. When we saw a dangerous animal, our bodies would react with anxiety and fear causing the ""Fight or Flight"" mode to be activated.

When the ""Fight or Flight"" mode is activated it changes your brain slightly. There is a part of your brain called the amygdala which becomes super active during this stage and heightens your emotional responses, In a dangerous situation such as seeing a tiger, overthinking can actually hinder your survival so the prefrontal cortex which proccesses logical stuff actually reduces in activity, at the same time cortisol and adrenaline is released in your body, these hormones help your body physically prepare to fight or run, however they also disrupt memory and logical thinking.

When we hear or have a thought that we may have X Condition a lot of the time the Fight or Flight mode gets activated in our brain, its a very strong compulsion to act to effectively save ourselves,  however the amygdala's overactivation makes it difficult to assess whether symptoms are anxiety-related or indicative of a health issue. This uncertainty and inability to rationalize can increase the need for reassurance, perpetuating the cycle of anxiety.

Health conditions aren't usually a fight or flight type thing, they don't require immediate action, but because our minds is trying to save us, our logical part of our prefrontal cortex reduces so it makes it so much harder for us to understand that these conditions are super unlikely to be actually happening to us. 

# Why Caffeine is bad for Anxiety

Caffeine functions as a stimulant in that it energizes your central nervous system. It may also cause tachycardia, hypertension, and feelings of excitability or nervousness.

Caffeine also releases adrenalin which is also literally called the fight-and-flight hormone. It is triggered by caffeine in the adrenal gland. The adrenaline makes sure that the body reacts quickly to stress through increased heart rate, high blood pressure and more energy.  
Caffeine prevents the production of the neurotransmitter adenosine which normally induces sleep. It obstructs adenosine resulting in further release of other transmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine which causes further increase in neuronal activation.

Effectively when you take Caffeine especially in high dosages, your body will be constantly in a state of fight or flight and when you are in this state of self induced fight or flight your brain will be trying its hardest to seek what exactly the danger is, and health anxiety is the perfect area for the brain to settle if it cannot seek an immediate danger. 

Sugar also can push your body to go into flight or fight mode, because it causes your pancreas to release insulin, if you consume too much sugar in a short period, your body will produce a lot of insulin, In response to a rapid drop in blood sugar, the body will release stress hormones, including adrenaline which again pushes you into that fight or flight mode.

# Rewiring your brain

In CBT there is something called the three systems model, this states there is three main states we are in.

1. **Drive System -** Acheiving Goals, Consuming Food, Accomplishing Tasks, Going to the Bathroom etc 
2. **Threat System -** Managing Threats, Survival, Escaping, Fear etc
3. **Soothing System -** Slowing Down, Sleeping, Relaxing, Spending time with friends, Playing Video Games, Watching Movies etc etc 

Now the issue with Anxiety and especially Health Anxiety is that we spend way too long in number two which is the threat system which means we can get stuck in ""Flight or fight"" mode, you maybe here due to nothing causing it, you literally can be here from drinking too much caffeine but your brains illogical part shuts down and then you attribute the threat to be the medical condition you have. 

The goal is to try and move your default state into the Soothe system and not into the threat system, and Caffeine is one of the main causes for being in the threat system when you don't need to be.

Like, I could be relaxing or enjoying something, but then I’ll feel a random pain for tingle and start spiraling. Any tips on how to calm down from that?",1702249364.0,120,92,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
18ev7j9,Strategy for managing health anxiety: “phone a friend”,"Hi all, I have found a strategy for managing my healthy anxiety that works pretty well. I call it “phone a friend.” It is exactly what it sounds like.

When you have an anxious thought…  call a friend! More specifically, ask them for two things: 

1) To say something reassuring (I have learned there is great power in a comforting word from a friend so I ask for it directly!) 

2) To let you know what you should do to investigate the symptom further. This usually looks like 
-nothing or continue monitoring 
-tell your doctor at next visit, no rush
-get an appt with your doctor 
-go to the emergency room

This works well because our anxious brains want to take action and we do this by googling or overthinking/spiraling. This makes the “action” someone else’s responsibility.",1702181578.0,8,4,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
18ethi3,"How do you manage ""the doctors are missing something"" thoughts?","I'm sure we all get this, especially the ""answer seekers"" among us who make frequent visits to the GP (I'm in the UK). You see constant stories in the tabloids of people who are now dying because their doctor kept missing their *death sentence* symptoms (especially those that you currently have). 

I know that these happenings make it to the junk-press because they're so rare, but fuck me if it's not exhausting trying to deal with scary symptoms when your doctors can't find anything wrong with you after tests, physical exams, scans etc. And after years of symptoms, my brain keeps telling me that they missed something at the start and by the time they discovered it, I'll be too far gone to treat. 

I apologise if I've screwed up, triggered anyone or posted in the wrong place. I'm new here and, to be honest, the anxiety is affecting my ability to think logically

*Edit: I apologise for not replying to individual comments. I'm still unsure if what I can say here without being banned. Which is understandable because I know how triggering these discussions can be. 

I fully understand the physical affects you guys gave described though. I was diagnosed with panic disorder secondary to illness anxiety disorder and was subsequently put on beta blockers. I wonder if that has helped any of you? 

I've actually found yoga quite helpful. Which I didn't think would be of any use due to being a sort of ""scientific/rationally-minded"" sort of person, but I do find it really calming when I realise there's nothing I can do until I can see a doctor. I think it's the feeling of your body working in a way that's aimed at mental wellbeing rather than working out to be physically healthy that sort of grounds me a little. 

Whether or not meds or excerise works for you (and neither work to really combat this constant limbo resolutely - but I hope you all find something that does), I'd like to say thank you for replying, and it's comforting to know I'm not alone.  

Respect to you all, people underestimate how hard it is to function while dealing with this ✌️",1702175468.0,39,49,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
18akeas,How do you cope with unexpected triggers from social media outlets?,"I have an extremely hard time coping with unexpected triggers. Mostly it’s from reels or TikTok stories that I randomly come across.

These tend to cause me to spiral the most and leads me down a rabbit hole of googling symptoms.

How do you cope with these unexpected triggers? Have you found any ways to help prevent these triggers?",1701697163.0,63,44,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
18abqom,Do you find using medical devices make HA better or worse?,"Wondering if anyone else essentially has a set up of items that you use to aid in HA?

For instance I have - a pulse ox, a Kardia device, a spirometer, a blood pressure cuff and lastly my blood glucose monitor.

Now, some of these devices are necessary for me, but most were bought from HA reasons. For some, these devices tend to cause more worry, but for me they have helped tremendously with my HA. That doesn’t mean I don’t have spiraling moments (and it’s funny because I know my HA issues are not as bad when I’m not using my devices as much)

Curious if anyone else also has a set up and does it help or make matters worse?",1701662259.0,8,49,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
18abfpo,HA worse in public,"My health anxiety is so much worse in public and I think the reason is I’m so nervous that if something were to happen to me in public then other people would see it and have to help me. 

Sometimes I’ll be in a grocery store and start to feel faint because I’m panicking about health anxiety. Usually whatever symptom I’m having goes away when I leave the store because I’m back in my own space. 

In society medical emergencies are almost always taken seriously and people want to help and make sure the person is okay, but as people with HA we don’t want to inconvenience anyone and we don’t want to have a situation in public. Why do you think we feel that way?",1701661244.0,24,5,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
189yts1,What should I be doing with my therapist?,"I’ve been seeing therapists for many years now but I don’t feel like I’m getting any better through them. I’m in a downward spiral right now and trying to remember anything that any of them have said or done to help me when I get fixated on certain medical things but I can’t remember any tangible advice. 

What should I be getting out of therapy that helps my HA? How should I bring this up with my therapist at our next session?",1701625763.0,9,4,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
1893mx7,Movies making illnesses seem very frequent when they aren't and feeding my anxiety,"Hi! I've notice that a LOT of movies and shows rely a lot on character getting illnesses as part of the plot and this has made me feel like it's pretty normal to be completely happy and healthy and getting an unexpected horrible diagnosis that changes your life forever, and that idea feeds my anxiety. 

Anyone else?",1701523376.0,22,9,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

I'm a young healthy person, so like many others here I'm terrified of cäncer and invariably terminal diseases. However, as illogical as it is, I'm almost totally unfased by the idea of getting specific types of it. For example I'm terrified of getting melanoma or lymphoma, and I've gone through very draining and stressful periods of trying to repeatedly reassure myself that I'm not in any danger, but if I see a person talking about their brain tumor or leukemia diagnoses, I can just confidently think ""yeah that's not going to happen to me"".

And I just find it so weird. The craziest part is that I have zero worries about my cardiac health even though my dad passed away from sudden heart disease in middle age.

1.  **Educate Yourself**: Gain a better understanding of the human body and common health conditions. Learning more about the causes, symptoms, and statistics of various illnesses can help demystify them and reduce unfounded fears.  

2. **Limit Dr. Google**: Avoid excessive searching for health information online, as it can often lead to misinformation and increased anxiety. Stick to reputable sources and consult with healthcare professionals when needed.  

3. **Set Boundaries**: Establish specific times for health-related concerns and avoid constant monitoring of your body or symptoms. Allocate time in your day for health worries and then move on to other activities.
4. **Mindfulness and Relaxation**: Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to manage anxiety. These methods can help you stay grounded in the present moment and reduce the tendency to catastrophize about the future.  

5. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Consider seeking therapy with a mental health professional who specializes in CBT. CBT can help you identify and challenge irrational health-related thoughts and develop coping strategies.
6. **Avoid Reassurance-Seeking**: Resist the urge to constantly seek reassurance from healthcare providers or loved ones. Excessive reassurance-seeking can perpetuate anxiety and reinforce negative thought patterns.
7. **Healthy Lifestyle**: Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, get enough sleep, and reduce or eliminate the use of alcohol, caffeine, and other substances that can exacerbate anxiety.
8. **Set Realistic Goals**: Gradually expose yourself to situations that trigger health anxiety, but do so in manageable steps. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small, to build confidence in managing your fears.
9. **Support System**: Share your concerns with trusted friends and family members who can provide emotional support. Sometimes, discussing your anxieties can help alleviate their intensity.
10. **Professional Help**: If health anxiety significantly impairs your daily life, consider consulting a mental health professional who can provide guidance, support, and, if necessary, medication to manage symptoms.  


* Last of all remember that overcoming health anxiety may take time and effort, but with persistence and the right strategies, you can significantly reduce its impact on your life.

Basically, does anyone know how to distinguish actual health issues or health anxiety? I want to tackle my HA because ironically it’s impacting my health quite a bit but I’m terrified that I’ll gaslight myself into ignoring a problem that actually requires attention.

17karfz,It gets better.,"I’ve had health anxiety since 2019 and it pretty much peaked at its all time high during the pandemic. Those sleepless nights constantly searching Google with the key phrase “Reddit” just to see if someone was experiencing the same thing as me really drained me. I want you to know though, it gets better. You’ll find the answer you’re looking for. Everyone has a different way of overcoming their HA worries and fears. For me, it was a 3 month online therapy course. It specifically focused on CBT therapy + a bit of exposure therapy. My two key takeaways/exercises that really helped me: 

1. Make worry time. Designate a time during the day where you can worry. If you have the urge to Google your symptoms, tell yourself, I’m just going to wait until later tonight where I can worry about this during my “worry time”. I usually tried not to spend more than 10-20 mins on this.

2. Breath in for 3 seconds, hold your breath for 3 seconds, exhale for 3 seconds. Repeat a few times. 

You got this. Stay strong.

You make a list of medical tests for conditions you are afraid of and rank them by how much anxiety inducing they are - from least to most scary. Then you do them one by one in order.

1. Routine checkup
2. Eye exam
3. CBC (complete blood count)
4. EEG
5. ECG
6. Chest X-ray
7. Abdomen ultrasound
8. Tumor markers
9. Brain MRI

174fusd,There is a difference between 'health anxiety' and 'anxiety about your health',"Five years ago I made a post on here detailing my experience overcoming health anxiety, and I just recently became active again. I made this decision after stumbling across the immense amount of people suffering with health anxiety on a daily basis in the megathread. I decided I would start responding to these daily posts in the hopes that a small amount of my time could potentially make a big difference for someone who feels lost.

That brings me to the subject of this post: one thing I see time and time again in this thread is people mistaking *health anxiety* with *having anxiety about your health*. These are **completely different** things.

Health anxiety is a mental health disorder (thankfully, one of the most treatable), and the absolute *hallmark* of this disorder... shall we say, a **requirement** of this disorder, is that at the bare minimum you need to have been seen by a medical professional.

I will repeat that again: in order to have 'health anxiety', you MUST have been to a medical professional. If you haven't, then you don't have health anxiety. At least, not yet.

Now I know what you might be thinking: even if I haven't been to a medical professional, isn't it possible that my symptoms are caused by stress and anxiety? Of course, the answer is a resounding YES. But you have to understand that health anxiety has little to do with those symptoms, and rather your *reaction* to those symptoms.

It is completely normal for people to experience uncomfortable bodily sensations and to assume the worst. That's just part of being human for many of us. I was one time discussing this with a friend who is a nurse. She told me that every year, around the holidays, they have thousands of people come in complaining of chest pain (thinking they are having a heart attack), but in reality they are just stressed out about the holiday season.

The difference between people with '*health anxiety*' versus people who just have '*anxiety about their health*' can typically first be seen in how they *react* when a doctor tells them nothing is wrong with them and it is just stress. A person without health anxiety will be *relieved* to know nothing is wrong with them and generally that will mark the end of this experience. A person with health anxiety, on the other hand, will tend to *mistrust* the diagnosis, assume the doctor is simply incompetent or hasn't ordered enough tests, and this will often times start a multi-month or multi-year journey of seeking out a diagnosis that was already provided, but simply not *accepted.*

If you are going into the daily thread to post about medical symptoms that you have never been checked out for, you are *in the wrong place*. Not only is this subreddit not made for you, but the 'comforting replies' you may expect to get in that thread will only serve to HURT you by potentially delaying your motivations to see a doctor. The truth is, **even if you do have health anxiety, the best thing you can do is see a doctor to** ***confirm*** **that.** That is a cornerstone of the healing process, because it provides you with the ammunition to react more appropriately to your unrealistic thoughts.

The sad reality is that 'anxiety about your health' is not a disorder. That is just part of being human. It is when that anxiety becomes *irrational*, meaning you refuse to accept the results of tests or your reactions to bodily sensations are considered far outside the norm, and when that irrational anxiety begins to negatively affect your life and ability to function, that you have 'health anxiety.'",1696925510.0,27,12,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

The average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**

This means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.

* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where ""marinating in the positive"" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).

16vrgwo,How i (weirdly) overcame hypochondria almost completely,"Just found this subreddit and tought i had to share how my health anxiety is almost completely gone. And its been gone for a couple of years now.

My way of overcoming it isn't by any means a way i would recommend to anyone, since it was extremely time consuming and ate thousands of hours of my life. Hours wich i could've done something better with, even tough it almost cured my health anxiety.

So just like every hypochondriac i tought i had new diseases ALL the time. I can't even count how many diseases ive tought i had. And as most others i always googled the symptoms and some horrible disease came up. But my anxiety became worse and worse through the years and after a while basicly all i did for a period of 2 years was to read about diseases. 

I was completely obsessed. Reading in my freetime and at work every opportunitie i got. I started to read on all the ""normal"" websites in my first language (english is my second language) at first. Read everything i could get my hands on. Then i started reading these websites that had alot of words that only doctors and such would understand. So i started googling all these words and phrases so i could understand what was being said on these websites. And after a while once i didn't think my first language websites had all the information i wanted on whatever disease i had that week, i started to read everything in English too. 

I got so extremely knowledgeable on a ton of diseases that i started to understand every small detail and intricacies of alot of diseases. Then i started to understand that the first website that comes up when you google some symptom is just a short summary of an disease. And yes you might have the same symptoms, but if you get get very familiar with a disease, you start to see that the symptoms you have are not at all the same as most people with this specific disease are experiencing at for example an early stage of a disease. Im not sure if im explaining it really well, but i hope you get the gist of it.

But i think what eventually ""cured"" me from health anxiety was the same thing as exposure therapy, even tough i did it unknowingly. Becouse i did spend thousands upon thousands of hours reading (and looking at pictures) about diseases in 2 different languages. 

I do suffer from other forms of anxiety still. But i would say that my health anxiety is atleast 85-90% gone. I feared so much for so long, and i exposed myself so much that it no longer scares me. If i get some symptom now i basicly think its nothing, or im brave enough to accept whatever disease that might come and just move on with my day.

But like i said earlier i would not recommend my way of overcoming this to anyone. There are probably tons of better advice and less time consuming out there. But i wanted to share my story becouse it might help someone in some way.",1696031281.0,20,4,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

\- Writing a book similar to ""Freedom Writers"" (a compiled book of diaries) where the people depict how HA makes them feel day to day, and other things that would help others understand what HA is and to not feel alone if they feel similarly.

\- Hosting charity dinners to help raise funding for a group that specifically investigates Health Anxiety scientifically (we need more studies)

Currently slowly overcoming health anxiety. It's taken me over a year to get to this point but I am happy with my progress so far and my loved ones have seen a big improvement in me too :) 

Now and again I have what I would describe as a bump in the road. I can go a week or two without spiralling then I'll have a slip up. It can then take me a few days to recover and get back to normal again. During this I will just get on with my day but it is always in the back of my mind when it happens. 

I think a part of me doesn't want to fully let go of my fears incase something bad really DOES happen. Maybe the tests I've done have missed something. Maybe I need to go back to the doctors for more extensive/thorough testing despite my symptoms not worsening. Maybe I need a full body check to be sure I am 100% healthy in other areas I didnt think about before.

16qqokc,Interesting interaction with AI and what I learned,"Hey everyone, checking in again [five years after I made this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/898up0/comment/jvunyho/?context=3) detailing my experience with health anxiety. As I think I mentioned there, I don't really use Reddit, so I apologize for not responding to any of the amazingly supportive comments. I'm doing excellent, never relapsed, totally moved on, etc. - but that's not what this post is about.

**Note: I will NOT be sharing a link to the app I'm about to talk about. I have firmly explained why people with health anxiety should ONLY discuss medical issues with a doctor - not Google, not AI, not even family members. I completely stand by this, and you need to recognize I am writing this as a person who does NOT have health anxiety anymore. Please do not ask for a link.**

I'm a programmer by trade, and naturally I've been working heavily with AI. I recently made an application with AI that allows you to input your age, biological sex, location, medical history, and a list of symptoms you are experiencing, and it will spit out the top 5 most likely explanations based on the totality of the information present *and the relative likelihood* based on the epidemiology. In other words, based on your age/location/medical circumstances, what is *most likely*.

Most people (including myself when I developed health anxiety) think of medicine as a matching game, where the disease that best matches their symptoms is the most likely explanation. That is *completely wrong* and not how the world works, which is something those of us with health anxiety have to learn the hard way. We desperately want an explanation that fits everything into a nice clean box, so when we Google our symptoms and find a rare disease that exactly matches our symptoms, we assume that must be the most likely scenario. News flash: in reality, *it's much more likely* that we are simply suffering from a combination of much more common, benign conditions.

**That's where things get interesting.** I had the idea yesterday to take the exact symptoms and demographic data from when I first developed health anxiety, using my original post on here as a reference since I hardly remember the exact details, and I plugged it in to the app. Imagine the shock on my face when the results showed *overwhelmingly* that my initial symptoms were best explained by:

**Anxiety/Panic Disorder - Extremely Likely**

None of the conditions I thought I had, which caused my health anxiety in the first place, even made the list at all (which implies they were well below a 1% chance).

Not only that, but as I started adding more and more of the 'symptoms' that developed as my health anxiety progressed, such as my fainting incident in the shower, eye issues, etc, the diagnosis essentially stayed the same, and the AI correctly identified all of the completely benign conditions that explained exactly what happened.

**Now here's the craziest part:** I went through hell for the better part of a year. Multiple ER visits, overnight hospital stay, and more tests than I can count, *NEVER ONCE* did a medical professional mention the word ""anxiety"" or ""panic"" to me.

NEVER ONCE.

I figured out I had anxiety completely on my own, and even after explaining to my neurologist that I thought I had figured it out after all this time, he completely dismissed me. Now, I am **NOT** implying that these medical professionals are not doing their jobs - in fact, they are doing their jobs perfectly. They are running tests and ruling everything out. But on the other hand, I could have saved myself a *lot* of suffering if I had even known anxiety/panic disorder could potentially explain my situation.

Even to this day, Googling my initial set of symptoms brings up a host of potentially dangerous and extremely scary diseases that are bound to trigger anxiety, whereas an AI that has been told specifically to utilize the relevant demographic data and weigh relative probabilities was quickly able to identify that anxiety was a much more likely explanation. In my mind, that is pretty damn cool.

Once again, don't bother asking for a link as I won't be providing it. The moral of this story isn't that you should be using an app to double check if you have health anxiety, it is that you need to **get it through your head that your thoughts as a non-medical professional are completely worthless**. You truly know nothing. If you are experiencing what you perceive to be a health crisis, *get checked out first*, and then once you get checked out, remind yourself that your perceptions are not reality, and in this case AI just so happened to be the medium that proved that yet again.",1695537971.0,10,3,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
16qj8zv,Let's start thinking about life more than we think about death,"My friends, during my health anxiety days I looked to map out my dying moments in different ways which kept me in a state of great tension and health anxiety prevailed. It's amazing how future thinking is more often than not coupled with catastrophic thinking for a health anxiety sufferer, when in truth we can begin to give ourselves permission to be in the here and now. 

We can begin thinking about our lives right now more than we think about the catastrophic future that may await us, therefore take energy away from fear and give it back to safety. Please give this idea some reflection today, you can do this.

16pddiw,Isn't HA a paradox?,"Sorry if it's a dumb or insensitive question. 

So, if you know you have health anxiety, doesnt that fact mean you KNOW you're probably actually physically fine? And on the flip side, If you're having real chronic symptoms, why would you presume you have HA? Physical symptoms cause legitimate anxiety, and i think people sometimes flip that around. Ive never seen a good enough evidence that anxiety can cause chronic symptoms (while it is obvious to me it can cause acute symptoms).

For me, I've developed several neurological symptoms this last year and tried to cling to the anxiety explanation. However I don't find it really holds water and as time goes by its getting more obvious to me that I'm developing some kind of neuropathy (probably sfn)/ fibromyalgia. 

So, what do you think? How do you know if you're an anxious person thinking he's sick or a sick person getting legitimately anxious?",1695396772.0,18,27,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
16or0ta,Everyone talks about googling... but searching or asking Reddit is even worse,"Even on subreddits like r/askdocs, seldom does an actual doctor that specializes in your condition's illness post. Most often, it is grade schoolers, high schoolers, and god forbid pre-med students playing Dr. House. In some cases you'll get med students, but they aren't doctors either. 

I fell into a 3 month long depression because I posted on r/askdocs on my throwaway. For me, it was a red patch on my tongue with some white in and around it.  I posted a picture of it and everyone diagnosed it as you know what. I am not surprised, if you google this, you will see the only possible conditions are what you would expect... (C word).

When I went to see the doctor, he laughed at the notion of it being that, and immediately diagnosed me with stomach issues (he saw the evidence of acid reflux in my mouth and referred me to a GI specialist). I made some life style changes (quit smoking, stopped drinking juice at night, made sure to eat no less than 3 hours before sleeping, etc.) Within a few months all evidence of that illness in my mouth went away.  
  
Not a single person in my thread mentioned ANYTHING about GI issues. Even Google provided NO hits for GI issues (which is probably why no one said anything, since all people do on Reddit is just Google your symptoms and read back the same shit you read and frightened yourself with). The only issue that came up that wasn't the C word was ""geographic tongue"", but my doctor says this is very often misdiagnosed especially in people with GI issues and/or on antibiotics. Once I started looking into GI issues and how it manifests on the tongue, I found MANY people talking about their strange tongues, and even finally found a person who posted a pic of their tongue that looked just like mine (on one of the GI issue subreddits, no less, and he was also diagnosed with GI issues). 

Hours and weeks of research never ONCE revealed this benign condition that I had. If it had, I would have immediately known, because I had been waking up with stomach pain every day for the better part of a year, had even awoken in the middle of the night a few times with what I thought was vomit in my mouth (it was acid from acid reflux), and constantly was using the washroom 5x a day.

16jf3gx,I made a short film about my struggles with HA,"Hey everyone, 

I'm not sure if this is allowed, so mods please take down if deemed inappropriate for this sub, but I wanted to share a short film I wrote and directed that is very close to my heart and may resonate with some in this community. That being said, **this film is not pleasant and it is not hopeful, but it is** ***HONEST*****,** and those who have seen it and who don't have HA, have told me for the first time, ""I can start to understand what you're going through.""

&#x200B;

[WATCH HERE](https://vimeo.com/dansilverfilms/benignshortfilm?share=copy) *(TW: please only watch if you feel like you're in a good place mentally. The film follows a man who discovers a bump on the back of his head and spirals into madness)*

As someone who deals day to day with OCD, specifically with HA and emetephobia, I always struggled to properly explain what my struggle really felt like. This film is an exploration of what my anxiety and intrusive thoughts feel like. Invisible illnesses like anxiety, depression, and OCD, are so hard to properly explain to someone who’s never experienced it; so I wanted to explore it in a visual and tangible experience that I believe is what film, as an art form and storytelling tool, achieves best.  
I have never seen a realistic depiction of what my mental health issues feel like, especially health anxiety, and so my goal with this film was to show the rawest and most realistic portrayal of it that I could. Being able to present these inner demons that myself and many others battle every day, and make them digestible so that anyone could experience how debilitating and uncomfortable it is to go through, can maybe—hopefully— challenge the way we talk about these things.  
In a way, this film is a release of all the thoughts and feelings I’ve had and have struggled with. It’s been therapeutic to let it out. To create a worst case scenario as a reminder to myself how ridiculous it looks when you take a step back from your own inner turmoil and reflect. I feel better having made it.

16ffe4c,Health anxiety truths,"I thought some of these points could be helpful, please reflect:

1) Don’t believe everything you feel - Your immediate feelings are a reflection of past fear centered programming and often don’t take into consideration an updated perception over an experience.

2) Your anxiety symptoms are messages and signals - Messages in the form of overwhelm, a chronically stressful life chapter, suppressed negative emotions. Signals because of a need to protect from unfamiliar upcoming situations or interpretations of threat.

3) Protect from less, enjoy your progress more - It’s best to take the approach of looking to protect the body from illness less and focus on living out the progress coming from your change work more. This shift takes time to embed deeply into mind and body, so be patient.

Slow down in the face of fear and you’ll tap into the kind of inner wisdom you could never feel into while being in your old frantic state.

16bsjqv,My Humble Recommendations,"1 - You need to chance it.
* This is the big deal. This is the thing. I can't say for certain that there is nothing wrong with you physically. No one can. And I know what you feel. What if there is something? What if I convince myself I've got anxiety now only to end up with a morbid disease? Won't I feel much worse? The thing is there is no way of knowing that for certain, though of course, the chances are very low. The chances are, if you are here now, cleared of all those medical tests and such, the only thing that is pathological about you is anxiety. Anxiety is a pathalogical liar. However, you will never heal from anxiety if you don't ever chance it, and live your life in constant fear and dread and panic. You know this. No matter what, this is just no way to live. You have got to chance it. Despite physical 'symptoms,' despite everything, chance it now, and go along with it. Physical symptoms won't just go away, but you have to keep telling yourself that you have just got anxiety if you are ever to recover from this.

2 - Start doing something you enjoy
* I can't stress this enough. Anxiety is a way of our brains to say, ""Hey, you are important, too."" You have got to give yourself some time every day to do something you enjoy doing. Watch movies, play computer games, whatever. You will just forget about this irrational feeling that is anxiety. And in time, you will see how silly it was of you to feel that way.

3 - Start exercising
* One of the things that made a lot of difference in my case was exercise. I enrolled in a gym, and went every day, except Sundays. I would feel the anxiety literally vanish as I ran on the treadmill. Exercise is how you banish anxiety. It just vanishes all of a sudden, even though for a short time.

4 - Meds help
* This is a sensitive subject, but if you are prescribed medicine, be sure to use them as your doctor described. It might take some weeks and even months for them to take effect. They can make it easier for you to deal with anxiety. Meds help, but they don't cure. They help a lot, though. They can make you see things more rationally.

5 - Start therapy
* Start paying a therapist instead of a physician. For myself, CBT helped me to such an extent that it became a part of my life. It helped me see hiw irrational and negative I have been. I now look back, and only feel silly for having such heightened levels of anxiety. Now, I am no longer frightened, and live my life confidently. I owe it to therapy.",1694026473.0,15,4,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
168ciz4,CBT early stages,"Hey! 

I have been on and off with HA for about 18 years. Recently I’ve actually managed to get therapy for it which I started two weeks ago. 

I’m doing ‘high intensity CBT’ (I’m not sure if this is a specific kind). But two weeks in I’m finding it’s making me feel worse. Is this common? Should I ride it out?

1670gaz,Do you think ABA (Applied behavior analysis ) is more effective at treating Health Anxiety than talking to a therapist?,"ABA is more focused on reinforcing desirables behaviors and help undesirable behaviors go extinct. Take the following example and see how ABA would be applied:

'Client A is watching TV. The TV plays a medical commercial. Client A begins to panic. They proceed to google about symptoms until they find information that tells them they are not likely to have the disease in the commercial. After a day of googling and panic, Client A finds the information and calms down'.

In ABA we would break this down to three part contingency (ABC) - Antecedent, Behavior, and Consequence

* Antecedent (aka the trigger) -  A medical commercial plays.
* Behavior - Client panics and proceeds to google symptoms until they find information that calms them down.
* Consequence - After a day of googling, they find information and calm down

So in this scenario the undesirable behavior is the client is panic googling about their symptoms to calm down. In ABA we would want to reinforce a coping behavior that is healthier. Some examples of healthy coping include:

* Reaching out to a trusted friend
* Removing yourself from the environment to go for a walk
* Focusing on different activities

The RBT (registered behavioral technician) would then run trials (approved by a Clinical Director) where they would present the stimulus (medical commercial plays) at random times during session, and they would reinforce the behaviors (healthy coping mechanism) such redirecting them from googling their symptoms through different types of prompts and learning techniques (shaping or token prize systems). 

For example when the medical commercial plays:

* Trial 1 - Client walks to computer to google \[ERROR\]
   * RBT provides ERROR CORRECTION by 'gesturing' a phone --> Client calls friend instead
* Trial 2 - Client walks to computer to google \[ERROR\]
   * RBT provides ERROR CORRECTION by 'verbally' suggesting to walk outside --> Client complies and walks outside
* Trial 3 - Client walks towards computer, but decides to walk towards door instead \[INDEPENDENT\]
   * RBT reinforces behavior by giving them their 1st token. 3 tokens are needed to redeem.
* Trial 4 - Client walks towards phone and turns off TV to talk to friend \[INDEPENDENT\]
   * RBT reinforces behavior by giving them the 2nd token.
* Trial 5- Client walks towards door and calls friend to talk \[INDEPENDENT\]
   * RBT gives last token. RBT reinforces behavior by letting client 'CASH OUT' and letting them watch their favorite show for 30 minutes during session.

\[NOW this scenario does not run through a non-compliance scenario (client gets aggressive because they cannot google symptoms), but there are many techniques as well such as RBT prompting client, waiting for client to calm down, redirecting the client with simple tasks (blink, clap, touch nose, goes back to original task of calling friend instead of googling).\]

The overall goal is for the client to go through these trials, and eventually fade all the assistance from the RBT so that the client can become independent at managing their reaction to medical commercials.

165t337,I keep getting mad at my boyfriends Health Anxiety,"My Boyfriend has Health Anxiety and I keep getting upset about it

My boyfriend (17m) and I (16f) have been dating for 9 months. I truly believe I have found the love of my life and I want to be able to help him with any issues he has. However, I grew up very isolated. My sister takes up my parents time and when they do talk to me I walk on eggshells so they don’t snap. I never had good friends so that’s the only behaviour I learned. Whenever my boyfriend comes to me with a health anxiety concern I get frustrated at him and respond how my parents would. I desperately want to fix that.
My boyfriend has had health anxiety (more specifically illness anxiety disorder) for the past 7 years after a choking incident. No matter what he always has a worry in his head about his health. Most of the time it’s about bacterial things like meningitis or sepsis, but he also often worries about small things, like whether a pin-sized cut is infected or more rare conditions. I also used to research poisons (was writing a book for class) and have memorized the flavours of a few, so everytime my boyfriend eats something he asks me to sample it even when it’s something I dislike to which I always oblige. I hate to say it, but sometimes I find his worries to be very strange since I’m the kind of person to just let a cut bleed dry and leave it.
At the beginning of our relationship I was more than understanding. I would often spend my nights researching conditions that he believed he had, finding loopholes to show him he didn’t have the conditions he thought he did. Recently however, I find myself snapping at him rather that offering comfort. I don’t snap at him out of frustration that he’s talking to me about his issues, rather that I don’t know how to properly help him. My methods of researching conditions wasn’t working, offering comfort in a hug barely comforted him, and now I’m lost and whenever he asks me for help I simply get frustrated and tell him I’m not a doctor and would have no way of knowing. I know this hurts him and I want to do better. Please help me",1693435088.0,4,16,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

It seems to me that she could be a hypochondriac or frequently exhibits signs of being preoccupied with her health and body. Sometimes she tells me in confidence that she has such a symptom or pain, and that she thinks it might be X problem.

The average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**

This means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.

* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where ""marinating in the positive"" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).
* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.
* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).
* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.
* Declaration of living life in the ""here and now"", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.
* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: ""being perfect"" vs ""being good enough"").

This is a bit of a strange one but I need some advice on whether or not it would be a good idea to set up a dedicated service for people who struggle with health anxiety.

I'm currently doing a course on CBT and I want to help empower people who struggle with HA to take back control of their lives by giving them the tools to do so.

This would be done using a dedicated website where people can seek important resources on health anxiety and panic.

As well as one to one sessions where I work collaboratively with individuals to set small achievable goals to help them get back on track. Using CBT and exposure response prevention to help people break out of these awful cycles.

I need objective opinions because my parents think it would be a bad idea.

I've just met up with her after coming back to my hometown from university after a while and she looks noticeably worse (Like more jittery)

I've know her for as long as I could remember, she's always been battling with eating disorders and I'm proud of how far she's gotten through it. But the past few years, she's been worrying more and more about her health with an obsession on the types of food she should and shouldn't eat to the point that it takes over her thoughts day and night.

I've made myself available to her 24/7 to call whenever her thoughts become too much but it's becoming harder and harder to keep my word since I have other responsibilities like work/university and dealing with my own issues. It's also been a lot harder for me to know how to help since I'm not chatting with her in person as much as we use to.

The last thing I want to do is make the problem worse, I give her advice like find distractions, maybe seek therapy, go on walks, listen to music, learn how to draw and tell her how proud I am. But I feel so defeated when I see her look worse and it's hard to stay positive. Are these the right things to say?

152shni,Sometimes doing the math helps me.,"So I've just had a panick attack about the possibility of catching N.Fowleri, which I assume you all know well about for the past day, because I swam in a pool that I wasn't absolutely 100% certain it was perfectly chlorinated. And of course,the fact that it is ""very rare"" didn't help easy my anxiety much at all. So I tried doing the math for myself,full of worst cases.  Approximately 90 million Americans, the country with the most of these cases, go swimming, in either freshwater bodies or the ocean. So let's cut that into a quarter just to be sure, because N.Fowleri can't be found in sea water and mostly not in moving water. But that is regarding the whole USA, and N.Fowleri is mostly found in more southern states, especially Texas ,California and Florida, which makenup about 27 percent of USA population. But again,just to be sure, We will cut it down to 20.(Lowering this number will make the percentage of likelihood  go up, because we are more strict about who is actually at risk)


N fowleri usually only has 3 cases per year, but some can go unreported,due to the rarity, and similarity of symptoms to Bacterial meningitis. So again, let's be careful. According to a source, it could be up to 16 a year.


Let's also assume  that only  10%of those could have put their head under water and may have got it in their nose.

That puts as at.

Tldr.

91,000,000 * 0.20 * 0.25 = 4,550,000
(91M is people who swim, 0.2 for southern states, 0.25 for freshwater lakes)
4,500,000 * 0.1 = 450,000
(0.1 for People who dove their heads under the water and could have gotten water up their nose)

And now, 16/450,000 That puts as at 0.0000356 which is about 0,0036 %. And that's assuming the absolutely worst cases.

And now, even further , let us assume another worst case that you are extremely unlucky, so let's multiply that by 100. That is still 0,36 % out of 100%. How likely do you think that is? And that would be assuming you actually swam in a very dirty lake, which I think all of us didn't.

And of course, sources.

https://www.livestrong.com/article/13730813-swimming-statistics/ the amount of people who swim.


https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/state-map.html.  Cases of N.fowleri by state.


https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5749439/ Here is more on the actual cases of N.Fowleri a year, which is estimated to be about 16. 






Another interesting statistic is this
https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/publications.html.  Which says about 1 in 10 pools is improperly chlorinated. And at first, I know this may be anxiety inducing but despite that, most cases of N.Fowleri come from freshwater lakes. Imporperly chlorinated is better than not chlorinated at all, remember that.

I have just spend a day having a panick attack about this, and when I look at this data, and the fact that I don't even live in the USA but Greece, where there weren't any reported case as far as I found I feel like an idiot.

14ra6lm,"Is it health anxiety, or medical trauma?","CW for medical trauma.

My first bout of health anxiety occurred after a traumatic event; it wasn't medical necessarily, but that's just where my brain ran with I guess. After some time, I grew out of it. Then, when my daughter was younger, she suffered an undiagnosed acute medical incident; she made a full recovery. I myself also began to have some chronic issues by this point, albeit fairly common ones which I've all but completely gotten a handle on now after years of meds and lifestyle stuff. I still struggle with health anxiety that I know is very illogical.

I have personally never met anyone with health anxiety who doesn't have at least some medical trauma. I have also personally seen people who previously had zero health anxiety develop it following a medically traumatic event.

I'm wondering what y'all think. Would it make more sense to refer to a lot of health anxiety as medical trauma?

The average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**

This means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.

* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where ""marinating in the positive"" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).
* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.
* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).
* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.
* Declaration of living life in the ""here and now"", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.
* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: ""being perfect"" vs ""being good enough"").

14luxyk,A word of hope (what finally helped me),"To all:

I am one of you, I know what you're going through. This past month has been tough for me, I was convinced that I had at least 3-4 different types of cancers and just bounced around from one to the other depending on the type of ""symptoms"" I was feeling at the time. The dermotologist finding a suspicious growth on my skin didn't exactly help either (that is what kicked everything off). This has been the worst episode of prolonged HA of my life, and has led me to be prescribed an SSRI, which I may or may not continue taking (hasn't kicked in yet).

Today I had a regular annual physical with my doctor, I went in nervous and left feeling the most relief that I have felt in the past month. 

What changed? Instead of focusing on what I think may be wrong, my family history of diseases, screening options, the types of labs I wanted, I instead fessed up and told her that my biggest issue is health anxiety. We ended up talking about health anxiety for 90% of my physical.

What I understood from our talk, is that we do not give doctors enough credit. They know what they're talking about, they can tell things about your health just by looking at you and asking a few questions. I went through a list of things I read on google with my doctor and she debunked it all, confidently. She explained the reasons why certain things I read do not apply to me, and why other things are complete heresay, misinformation, or represents a statistically irrelevant number of cases. In the end I actually ran out of concerns to point out, she had fielded them all and I had nothing left. Even trying to grasp at ""what if in the future..."" were shut down by the simple reply of ""you are a healthy young man, with nothing to fear"". Sometimes that is just what we need to be told.

I know it's intimidating, but I urge anyone that has not visited their doctor in some time due to fear to schedule that appointment. You don't need to do any tests, just have a talk, explain your fears, and listen to logic. It ended up being the exact thing I needed to hear.",1688012607.0,79,8,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

14h9gpb,When did you first start showing signs of health anxiety?,"I only found out about my health anxiety in my 20s but I remember displaying signs as young as 7/8 years old.  I remember having an urge to check if my heart was still beating.  I would physically put my hand to my chest and check my heart was still pumping and it would give me a sense of relief.  I couldn’t enjoy myself for checking this.  

It then progressed onto having anxiety attacks about death/ dying and the meaning of life.  I would literally be going around my normal day then have a huge anxiety attack.

When I got older I moved on to poking and proddinf parts of my body to check for lumps or abnormalities.   I would literally bruise myself because I was prodding so hard. I would find a bone or a bobbly but in my body and convince myself it was a tumour and I was going to die.

Then when I was about 12/13 the first computer came into my house and I would use it to doomscroll medical websites and convince myself that my headache was a result of a brain tumour or some other severe disease.

I then began making countless doctors appointments about small minor things that I thought were life threatening.

It wasn’t untill I was in my twenties that I properly discovered what all this was caused by.  

I spoke to my doctor about it and realised that my health anxiety was probably triggered by my mother having a brain tumour and seeing her in hospital when O was only 2.

I am now on anxiety medication and I am doing really well.

I still have the odd urge to google symptoms or get triggered by people talking about illnesses but I have learned to manage it a lot better",1687553599.0,14,26,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
14guse2,Things that have been helping me with health anxiety over the last 6 months,"Hello folks, 

**Some background:** I (31M) have been suffering from health anxiety from last 8 months now. I have been diagnosed with Costochondritis (chest pains). It all started with me able to feel my heartbeat, palpitations and later developed into full blown HA. And then the chest pains obviously increased the health anxiety. I stopped doing things that increased my heartbeat like running, playing which I really used to enjoy. 

First step was obviously visiting a doctor and getting all the tests done related to heart and chest. I got it done twice because I was so anxious that what if the first doctor didn't do a proper diagnosis. Thankfully everything came all right but obviously the symptoms were still there and with chest pains I used to have random anxiety episodes. This became an anxiety loop and I wasn't having proper sleep which was increasing the stress and then increasing the anxiety. 

**What I have been trying:**

* First thing I did was to visit a physiotherapist who helped me with some stretching exercises to help with my Costo. I have been doing it daily for the past 3 months and have been paying much more attention to my posture. Most of my work is behind the laptop and Costo can aggravate due to bad posture. Costo is not completely gone but it has become manageable. 
* Doing mindful relaxation/meditation: I have been doing it almost 5 times a week on the Insight Timer app. It has helped me by far the most among all the things. Helped with the general anxiety or anxious feelings, general calmness, slow breathing, reduced stress etc. My sleep also became better due to this which has a huge healing effect. Once your sleep gets better, you will automatically feel calmness and less anxious. If you do this then try to pick up a course rather than doing the same meditation daily. They teach a lot of things including how to be kinder to yourself and to not judge or put yourself under pressure. 
* Read the DARE book by Barry McDonald and follow the practices he mentioned. He has suggested some very simple practices and it really works. He also suggests mindful relaxation along with multiple other things.
* Daily walks: This has been life changing for me. I started doing daily walks for 35mins-1hour and it really took my mind off things. Try going out even if your mind says no. Force it few times and you will love it
* Almost zero caffeine: I never liked coffee too much so this was easy for me but reducing caffeine is very important. Drink lots of water. 

Along with all of the above, my partner has really helped in the whole journey. She listens to me and supports me which is really important. 

**Where am I in the journey**

Above stuff has been truly helpful and things are much more manageable for me right now compared to 6 months ago. Costo is not completely gone and other symptoms like palpitations, feeling the heart beat etc are there but I have trying to live with it without getting stressed. I trust that it will heal in its own time. That time could be months, years but I have accepted this truth that I need to have patience. Things will happen at their own pace and I should try to be happy, calm and live the life. Everyone has their challenges and life throws ups and downs but there is no option but to navigate it. How you react to those challenges is more important than the challenge itself. 

Remember there will be setbacks, lot of them, in fact I just had one setback yesterday but it wasn't as bad as before. I was able to get through it in a much better manner without worrying too much. 

Life is a journey and not an event so don't let this even define you. You will be fine, just have patience and keep trying. Want to add that I have tried lot of other things too but some didn't work and that's fine. It will happen and different things work for people but do try things then only you will know what works for you.

Hope this helps someone. ",1687515528.0,14,7,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
14gg33p,Recovery Story: How turned the curse of health anxiety into a blessing.,"First of all, hi! My name is Dan, and I'd suffered from OCD for 18 years, which turned into health anxiety 5 years ago. Today I will tell you my story, how it began, how it climaxed and, most importantly, how it became a tool for me to live a more authentic life. 

When I was around 8 years old, I liked playing Pokémon. Not liked, LOVED. My little monsters were everything, the quality of my days were dictated by how much progress I made in the game, if I was able to catch something new. There was a twist to all of this, however: at that time, it was not uncommon for cartridges to stop working suddenly. That HAUNTED me, I was obsessed with the idea of it to stop working and losing everything. I discovered, that, after many years, what I just told you was the beginning of my OCD. 

It expressed itself in many different ways and, despite it being strong or weak, it never took the bright from living. It was until, one day, I looked in the mirror and saw a weird looking mole with a blackhead in the middle. After debating with myself, I went ahead and popped it: ""WHAT IF IT WAS C WORD'. I struggled with this thought for a couple of hours, then it went away.

 A year later, I had some weird results on my blood work. The number, the idea of having something wrong with me, my head was insane chaos. I was desperate for an answer (which I found), but it was too late: there was, then, always something new. Slowly, it became worse and worse. It stopped being something periodical, and became constant. For 6 months my life was nothing but an insane obsession with 0,001%s, I was not able to live properly, I had no appetite, and only thought about having a concussion or an autoimmune disease. Half of my day was spend on the HA subreddit, venting about my fears.

This is when I drew the line, I needed to do something. I started bringing this topic into my psychoanalysis sessions and doing ERP on the side, since it's not supported by the type of therapy I was doing. It was HARD. H A R D. In both schools of thought, ""treatment"" (I dislike this word) is not meant to be intuitive or fun. In fact, many psychiatrists say that ERP is the hardest therapy to do. I will now, share what helped:

**What I learned with psychoanalysis**: My health anxiety, as well as my OCD, was a way of my unconscious mind to express an excessive desire of perfection, as well as the belief of its existence. Me and my therapist called it the ""circle': no sharp edges, smooth. Life, however, is not like that, it might be circular, but also have some bumps and sharp turns. I believed that I NEEDED this ""perfect life"" to be happy, and looked for it through these symbolical obsessions. Why did I have this desire? My parents hardly gave me limits, which created in me a never-ending desire for more. 

This was called a core fear, often talked about in CBT. Our health anxiety is hardly ever a symptom of being afraid of truly being ill, but a fear of something rooted deep down.

**What I learned with philosophy:** I started studying philosophy, and one philosopher in particular caught my eye: Friedrich Nietzsche. It is not possible to explain his school of thought properly here, it would take more than 10 pages, but one specific ""mindset"" (if you could call it that) helped me: we, as humans, refuse to live life how it is. We create conflicts, nonsensical morals, non-existing relationships, we hardly ever truly live. We are afraid of accepting the melancholy of life in its purest form. However, by being defensive about it, we also do not allow ourselves to taste its color. What does he say that we should do? AFFIRM life. Be ready, willing and happy to suffer, to have the most intense illness, and understand that it is the nature of life. Be willing to suffer and to die. 

I started doing ""safe unsafe"" things on purpose, like for ex going for a road trip, jumping with a parachute, or traveling to a country with no great medical care. In addition, avoiding perfection in everyday life also helped. 

**What I learned with ERP:** ERP, or Exposure Response Therapy, is meant to expose you to your fear in order to desensitize you from it. Sounds easy in practice, but for us, anxiety sufferers, it is more difficult. The processes is not as straight forward as for a focused phobia, for example. How do we expose ourselves if we have HA?

1 - Do not google, check your lymph nodes, do not avoid the doctor, etc. Why? Because if you don't, you expose yourself to UNCERTAINTY. You might only be able to do 1%, and that's ok. Do 1% every day. Eventually, you will be able to do 2, then 5, then 10... it gets easier!

2 - Do not problem solve in your head!!!!! This is a type of compulsion that we do that tries, again, to take us away from UNCERAINTY. 

**LOOK FOR UNCERTAINTY!** Do not accept it, **affirm** it. My view nowadays is vastly different: I see life now as an experience that has no guarantees, and that's the **nature of it**. If life brings me pain, illness, distress, that's okay, because that's what life is. I know it sounds pessimistic, but it's the complete opposite: you live more authentically. I now cherish the present moment, I feel like I ""woke up"" and every day is meaningful in its own way. 

Weirdly enough, I thank my OCD and HA. If it weren't them, I wouldn't be sensitive to living a lie, and would experience just ""proxies"" of my desire without retaliation from my mind. Hope you all have a wonderful day, recovery is possible and we have the opportunity to learn along the way. Sending love, you can do it!!",1687470414.0,70,5,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

As long as I can remember someone in my family has been really ill. My great nan, my nanny, my grandad. My stepdad died a couple of years ago very suddenly. It's all built up now and I have so, SO much anxiety over my family and their health. My mum has a mammogram next week (it's just screening) and I'm more bothered about it than she is. My sister is always dealing with one little thing or another. My nanny, even after going through so many bad illnesses, is still going strong! But the last couple of years have hit hard. 

The idea of someone I love getting really ill again, I just couldn't deal with it. I only have a small family but we're extremely close, I couldn't live without them. It's almost easier when it's your own issues, you know yourself and you choose to get help if needed. With other people it's just a constant fear.

I went through some health issues of my own for ~6 months that was really hard, but it feels like whenever I get on track with my own issues I just get anxiety over my family instead.

14696ei,How would I bring up to my doctor that I discovered connections to my health from a video?,"Apologies for my punctuation, I’m not very good with it.

I’ve always been obsessed with the inner workings of my mind and finding a way to “get better”, but when I research a disorder/illness and it seems to connect dots to me I want to bring it up. The issue is my family tends to take the opportunity of me doing this and use it to their advantage by saying “hypochondriac” or “I’m just looking for more symptoms to add” when that is far from the truth.

For example; before I starting writing this post I was watching a video on visual show syndrome, a disorder where someone will see something like tv static in their vision. This caught my eye. All my life I’ve had vision troubles, far sighted, astigmatism, etc; but I never thought about how seeing “floaters” or the static in my vision could be something completely different than my failing vision. I would like to bring it up to my doctor the next time I see her, I’m just fearful my family’s affect on her will sway her opinion. Even if this isn’t what I’m going through, i want to make sure that I’m not overlooking it or ignoring it.

13x572q,Daily Positivity & HA Journey Progress Updates [MEGATHREAD]. Month of June 2023.,"**The megathread for vents, rants, worries, fixations, DAEs, finding support/advice, finding reassurance, symptom focused content, or the like is located here :** [**http://reddit.com/r/healthanxiety/about/sticky**](http://reddit.com/r/healthanxiety/about/sticky) Thank you for using the above thread for the above content as some users may experience distress if they were to unexpectedly read content that they were not mentally prepared to engage with or are just trying to take a breather from. 
___

The average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**

This means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.

* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where ""marinating in the positive"" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).
* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.
* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).
* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.
* Declaration of living life in the ""here and now"", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.
* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: ""being perfect"" vs ""being good enough"").

**REGARDING ""journey updates"" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the ""update post"" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post. Thank you for your cooperation.

13u1r57,Any advice on how to stop going down rabbit holes on the internet?,"For a bit of context im a girl in her early twenties. I think I've always naturally been an anxious person but over the past three years my health anxiety specifically has shot up significantly. I like to go for walks(approx about 1 and a half to 2 hours of walking most days) and I have had jabs like for tetanus, covid and meningitis etc. But it's like even though I feel ""safe"" reading that, it's almost like then I'll go on the internet and I'll find something which takes away that previous feeling of safety around my health. For example today it was going online and seeing an article saying that even if you've been vaccinated against meningitis you can still get bacterial/viral meningitis. I've often heard people say that very often with health anxiety, someone can have all the injections and vaccinations against as many illnesses as possible but it still won't take away/""cure"" their health anxiety",1685284031.0,24,20,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
13tr7np,"As someone who can't drive, here's my process for when I have to convince my loved ones to actually take me to a doc for a problem that developed out of the blue","Hi, hopefully this is the right flare for this.  Don't know if this is a stigma related thing or a society related thing. I don't mean this as a ""DAE?"" post (but apologies to mods if it is, actually lol). But this is something that happens to me often. I'm 26, but live at home with my family because of my cerebral palsy, for example. I know sometimes it's hard to convince someone to actually get you to a doctor in a prompt matter (especially after a Dr. Google Spiral). And HA definitely makes it worse because you start thinking you have a limited window to get to a doc to fix ""a condition"" (that you may not even have!)  


I've found that, if it's something that doesnt resolve itself with at home treatments, it's good to keep your loved one up to date on how you feel, and be honest about it. Currently going through that, with my mother and i trying different kinds of remedies to rule out a more mundane problem. This morning I texted her saying that it would be a good idea to go to a doctor if this doesnt sort itself out with what we're currently trying, in (hopefully) a day or 2.

Note that this is of course not medical advice and it depends on your symptoms/severity of pain. I'm lucky enough to have a problem that is possibly explained away by HA for most of it, save for the one actual, provable physiological problem. lucky as well as a supportive family.   I'm also trying to distract myself as much as possible, and that definitely helps as well. I'd recommend that as well. Put on some show you like, or even a show that you don't think is *that* great but makes a good timewaster. While I'm trying to distract myself, I'm basically going through the backlog of episodes I may have missed or shows I never had the full interest in getting into when I'm at 100% lol  


This might only work for a few people, but if you do have a specialist you see multiple times a year, try to think about how much you trust them too. Unless your doctor is really neglectful (and hopefully you wouldn't still be seeing them if that's the case, but I've been there and it happens. Even the worst doctors I've had are still smarter than me about a lot of the ailments I face, mostly!) I'm sure they would know you the best and have mentioned the possibility of any new ailments coming up. Note that you should still make an effort to see your doc about this, or given the topic the post, communicate to whoever's driving you about that. Of course, now after the era of Covid, your doc may also do telehealth appointments, which are a godsend to me when I can use them.

Lastly, and to mixed results, but mostly helpful, I try to keep a genuine mental record of my symptoms. Obviously this can sometimes go wrong or make anxiety worse. But say, if I'm concerned about if a body part stopped functioning, i think of all the ways it is still functioning. This can create less of an urgency (it does for me, at least) in the meantime while your loved ones do what they have to do in their own lives.

I'm kind of going through this myself so I thought for once this week I'd put more positivity and helpfulness into the internet, to take a break from my own doom spiraling lol.

13qz69n,"Live life, not predict life","Here's something that comes into my mind today, and I would like to share with all of you.

Imagine the following two people:

Person #1 spends 75% of his life worrying, learning, and stressing out over every body sensation and potential disease, and this person is physically healthy and lives to 100 years old.

Person #2 enjoys his life 100% of the time. This person just goes with the flow, lives very mindfully and appreciates every second of life despite having critical illness his whole life. This person dies young at the age of 40 years old. 

This is a very extreme case but you get the point. Person #1 only enjoys his life for 25 years, but person #2 enjoys his life for 40 years despite living much shorter. I guess spending less time stressing out about health can make you actually ""live"" longer. So folks let's stop googling symptoms and just trust our doctors. If you think you have a disease, discuss it with your doctors, if they say it's nothing to worry about, then move on. If it is indeed a disease, follow the treatment plan. Just try your best to live a healthy life style, and the rest of it is things we can't control, so there's no need to think about them. I know it's easier to say than done, but this is the right mentality we all should work on.

Just like you guys, I have health anxiety my whole life. My worst time was 2021 where I was learning and focusing on every little sensation and it ruined my life. My anxiety was off the roof and the more I google about stuff the more anxious I was. It became a viscous cycle and I needed psychiatry help.

13owio4,EMDR for health anxiety,"Hi everyone. I recently found out that a new form of treatment technique called Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) has had stellar results in patients with panic attacks (source: https://amnelson.com/2018/10/18/emdr-therapy-for-panic-attacks/#:~:text=EMDR%20(eye%20movement%20desensitization%20and,event%20or%20a%20negative%20cognition.). It is very helpful for people with PTSD, and some other mental disorders. Some doctors suggest this could be applied successfully to health anxiety cases (source: https://www.lewispsy.org.uk/resources/health-anxiety/#:~:text=EMDR%20for%20health%20anxiety&text=EMDR%20processing%20can%20be%20applied,and%20prepare%20for%20future%20experiences.) to disarm triggers and avoidance behaviors, among other aspects of the disorder.
I haven’t tried it for myself but I figured it was worthwhile sharing it in here. It is still a fairly new treatment, but it might just be what works for some treatment-resistant people or just people with more severe cases of the disorder.
For anyone particularly struggling with health anxiety, you could talk to your therapist about this.
Hope this helps :)",1684774871.0,2,1,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
13or55x,What kind of support do you ask for from your partner?,"Hi, 
Just found this sub and it's making me feel a lot less alone. I've been having bad, nearly debilitating, health anxiety for about 6 months now (I am in therapy, btw!) and sometimes I feel a bit out of my mind. I think a lot of it has to do with religous trauma and being so out of touch with my body for so many years, but thats a whole other issue...

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how I can ask for support from my boyfriend. I find myself constantly asking him for reassurance (like, does this look swollen to you??) and it's frustrating and draining for both of us honestly. And I don't think constantly seeking reassurance is healthy.

Is there any external support that you find helpful from partner/friends/etc when you're very worked up or having a panic attack? Affirmations, talking you down, etc? Obviously I'm doing my best to use coping mechanisms myself, but I'm really brainstorming for specific ways I can ask my boyfriend to support me, because I can tell he has no idea what to do when I'm in that state and I'm sure that's frustrating.",1684762572.0,3,2,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

13leo0k,"PSA: If you're on this sub, there's a good chance your health anxiety is actually a form of OCD.","I post this every now and then because I was in a very dark hole with my health anxiety.  I had some very real health problems I was dealing with, but my anxiety made them feel like life sentences.  I could barely function, and was desperate for help.

&#x200B;

I noticed that any normal ""anxiety""-based therapies did not help my health anxiety.  If anything, they worsened it.  Stuff like meditation, talking about it, writing about it, etc.  It made my anxiety far worse.  I knew that OCD ran in my family and I had small compulsions in my life, but I didn't realize that there is something called Pure-O.  


Basically, this type of OCD means you have compulsions and rituals (much like washing your hands) but they're all mental.  For us with health anxiety, that means you might have an intrusive thought about your health and will immediately need to ""cleanse"" your mind by googling or asking someone for reassurance.  Do you notice that you feel some relief, temporarily, but then the thought comes back and usually stronger after some time?  That's OCD.  That's the exact feeling someone has when they feel the need to constantly wash their hands.  They just *need* to clean their hands physically, the same way you *need* someone to tell you that you're going to be ok.  


Luckily, treating OCD is simple though difficult to achieve.  You can look into Exposure and Response therapy and all the other OCD therapies, but really it comes down to this - don't act on your thoughts.  Don't create secondary thoughts from them.  Definitely don't google or ask for reassurance.  Just let your thought come into your head, and immediately try to focus your attention elsewhere.  Don't even try to force the thought out.  Any type of ""interaction"" with the thought isn't going to help.  Just let it stay there, and eventually, it'll leave.

It feels difficult at first ,but over time you'll have a ton of practice.  I still have good days and bad days, but my bad days are few and far between whereas they were 90% of my waking life before.

I repeat this to myself daily, along with positive affirmations like ""I take care of my body and my body takes care of me. I trust my body to do its job like it always has."" 

I really highly recommend this book and the DARE app, even the free version is incredibly helpful and there are audios specifically to help with health anxiety and scary sensations. If you can't afford the book, what I did was sign up for a free audible trial and used my one credit to get the DARE audiobook and then cancelled and it let me keep the book.

The average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**

This means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.

* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where ""marinating in the positive"" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).
* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.
* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).
* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.
* Declaration of living life in the ""here and now"", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.
* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: ""being perfect"" vs ""being good enough"").

If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the ""update post"" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post. Thank you for your cooperation.

131od2c,"Think horses, not zebras","Hi, I'm a long-time health anxiety sufferer. I've had it for about 16 years since I had kids. 

Since I turned 50 I've gotten better at managing it through self talk. 

I would say I'm 80% improved on two years ago when I had HA pretty much 24/7 and it ruled my every waking moment. My life was a misery of lurching from one worry to the next all day long.

I had lots of therapy (CBT and Schema), but in the end I think I just exhausted all possible things to worry about several times over. 

I still get intrusive thoughts several times a day, but they don't have the same power over me as they used to.

I heard something from a doctor on a podcast the other day and I've been using it to good effect this week. 

He said when you hear hooves, more likely than not, you're going to see a horse, not a zebra and it's the same with health anxiety. All the worst case scenario things our minds go straight to when we have a symptom, rarely turn out to be anything big.

Hopefully this might help someone.",1682679512.0,85,11,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

You aren’t a doctor, nor is Google.

Think about how often your assumptions are actually right 

Anxiety can make you feel things that are not actually there 

It’s OK it’s not feel good 

Think about how often this happens , the amount of times you felt like this, you survived, right?

12n7urr,How I’ve been unarming health anxiety thoughts,"Hi all,

I’ve been in this health anxiety loop for over 10 years now. It started as a low-level anxiety, over the years evolved into full blown 24/7 panic attack loop, with the peak being a full day of me going to ER and back home a few times to make sure my heart is okay. After that, I knew I had to learn to cope and each new anxiety period became much more bearable. So I want to share with you some things that helped me. You might have heard some of these before but I’ve also added a little twist to them that helped me a ton.

1. If you can’t help but Google, better to look up actual medical publications (NCBI) and read those publications end-to-end. Because there you can see realistic picture of a bunch of bombastic newspaper headlines which are made to scare you. If you were to read the actual paper referenced in those articles you would see that there are major problems with sampling or how it was conducted etc. and that you can’t look into one aspect in medicine without considering everything else. If you find them too hard to read that probably should tell you how complex each disease is and how having one symptom or even multiple doesn’t mean chance of a disease.

2. Being active in this subreddit. I have mostly been lurker and only commented a few times when I saw my insight could help a bunch and it always did help! I’m supremely introverted so if I could do 2-3 comments over the years anyone can! It’ll help you show yourself how much progress you’ve done since you are now in position to help others even.

3. Keeping the detailed journal of every sensation and my anxiety over that sensation and making it easily searchable. I kid you not, in 90% of cases I thought I was experiencing something completely new I found an entry from like 7 years ago with matching description. We seem to always give more credit to what we are feeling right now and forget how horrible something felt previously.

My twist on all of these: I’m an AI engineer so I made a chatbot of my experience and experiences of people in this subreddit, along with some flaw-finding for “studies”. It allowed me to talk with my previous self and others in my position basically instead of having to search for similar symptoms.

Now, I’m really bad at organization but good at programming which is why this worked for me but you can probably get similar results just by organizing all your thoughts and other peoples thoughts very well to make it searchable.

I might also be willing to make this sort of bot for wider audience but only if there’s overwhelming majority asking for it as it’s a lot of work to do if it won’t help far and wide people beat this fear.

What I just want to reiterate is that things get better. It might seem dark now and you might have a setback but over a longer period they do improve and I haven’t had panic attacks as bad as I did before for some 3 years now ☀️",1681573009.0,85,6,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical
12ih7nf,How do I know when to go to the doctor about something and when to just let something go as a result of my anxiety?,"I keep doing my best to accept that I can’t always be sure if I’m perfectly healthy and that I need to let some things go and not focus on them so much that it affects me. But here’s my problem, every time I find a bump or a random pain or something I think to myself “okay don’t let this bother you it’s probably nothing, just ignore it” but then I’m consumed by my next thought which is “what if this one time it actually is something bad and I should be listening to my body and getting it checked” but then that thought comes around for everything I think could be a problem… so, how do I ever let anything go and ignore it?! I want to not care and not think about it but the idea that I might miss something that could be really bad and could have been treatable if I caught it sooner makes me feel like I need to check absolutely everything and worry about everything… I don’t want to feel like this anymore it’s so hard to deal with every single day",1681213597.0,86,31,HealthAnxiety,mental_physical

1qamowz,Odd leg pain,"I’ve been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and definitely unrelated episodic cluster headaches. For my entire life, I’ve had pain in the highlighted purple area on my left inner leg. The pain is extremely thin (millimeters even), around two inches deep, and often flickers along this line. It feels like I’m being repeatedly and quickly sliced with a hot razor. It’s intense to the point I can no longer continue doing whatever I was doing, and have to flex my foot as hard as I can like a ballerina and dig my fingers into the muscle to (slightly) dull the feeling. My calf usually cramps because of this but it’s so bad that I don’t really care. 

I get unbearably panicked as well because it can last anywhere from 2-3 seconds to 10+ minutes. This level of panic I experience is only rivaled by my cluster headaches which really makes me wonder what the fuck this thing is. The actual area experiencing the pain is so so small and it completely confuses my brain. 

This seems very distinct from the usual fibromyalgia symptoms, which only showed up when I was 14. The earliest occurrence of this leg pain was probably when I was in elementary school. The reason it’s an issue now is while before it was fairly rare, once or twice a month, now it’s every day sometimes multiple times a day.

1qam3p3,Opioid contract question,"Hi all,

First, apologies if this isnt the right subreddit for this. I looked around and it seems okay but, apologies if Im mistaken. 

I am prescribed an opioid due to chronic pain. I have an appointment with a pain management specialist once a month, and take a drug test every two months. All has been fine. 

During Christmas time, my pain was especially bad and I ended up taking a 10mg gummy that contains THC. Id take these before being prescribed opioids with some success in relief. My opioid contract clearly states that I cant use THC. I decided to risk it because I wasn't due to be tested again until February and the pain was high enough to make me try it. Didn't really help with pain and didnt try it again. 

My next telemed appointment is scheduled for tomorrow, but two days ago the doctor's office called and surprised me by telling me I had to come in for my appointment tomorrow specifically for a drug test (no idea why. New year? New insurance? Try and catch me?). 

I took a few at home drug tests and frustratingly, I've passed some and failed some. I have no idea at all tomorrow if Ill pass or not. 

So, do I admit to my doctor what happened before I take the test and be honest, risking that I may actually test negative and told her for no reason? Or should I take the test and wait until I possibly fail before admitting anything? 

Thanks in advance.",1768194450.0,3,13,ChronicPain,mental_physical

1qakgb1,Anyone else have upper back pain that’s worse with sitting/standing but better with walking or lying down?,"I’ve had chronic upper back / neck pain for about 3 years now. What’s confusing is that it’s not triggered by exercise or movement, but by holding positions. Sitting and standing still are the worst. Walking feels better, and lying down (especially on my stomach) gives the most relief.

Stretching, PT, dry needling, massage, gym work, and even injections only helped temporarily. MRIs show only mild degenerative changes, nothing serious. The pain builds over time during the day and resets if I overload myself with long, unbroken workdays.

It seems like my body just can’t tolerate static postures anymore, even with “good posture.” Movement helps more than rest, but too much stillness makes everything flare.

A year or two later I had a third surgery as I was still in a lot of pain and this is what my dr and surgeon recommended. They took out scar tissue and found out that there was fluid buildup and bone that was never covered.

1qajcvl,Feeling scared and hopeless-26 F,"I worked as a dental hygienist 4 years full-time just stopped working in June at 26 due to awful pain. I used to come home and cry because my body began to hurt so bad. I built up this chronic tension over the years that just kept getting worse and worse. This year it became so bad I had to stop. I thought once I stopped I’d feel much better and heal as time passed, but it’s been 6 months and I feel like I’m in a nightmare. Everything feels so tight and sore constantly in my TMJ, neck, upper back, especially left sided, and has even started to affect my armpit area on the left and my hips feel chronically ached and tight now. I noticed in the last week my ankle on the left side has started to become an issue as well. I’ve had a swollen trap on the left for a while too. Like a hard lump of muscle. My tmjs have knots and lumps near them to the point where my jaw is out of alignment. I clench and grind bc my pain is so bad. Advil has stopped working and muscle relaxers aren’t doing much. I’ve seen numerous doctors. No one can figure out what is causing this and have called me a zebra case. I had an mri of my cervical spine, thoracic spine, brachial plexus. MRI of cervical spine came back with extremely mild stenosis. Thoracic spine mri said I have a mild disc bulge at t2 t3. They aren’t sure if either of these are definite drivers of what’s going on. Brachial plexus mri was clear. I hear constant crepitus glowstick like noises whenever I move my neck. If I twist the right side of my body slightly forward I get awful spine pain that almost feels like it goes into my chest. Makes me feel like I can’t breathe sometimes. Rheumatology has ran all the bloodwork you can think of and it was negative. Also did pelvis mri which was clear. They want to put me on cymbalta but I don’t want to take it as I’ve heard bad things about withdrawal and starting it. Also that is just a bandaid to me. IM 26 FOR PETES SAKE. I need to know what’s going on. It’s ruined my life. I can’t function like this. I’m beginning to think that I have cancer and am dying slowly",1768186498.0,4,12,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1qajaye,Looking for feedback on goals/progress,"Hello everyone, after my finals week (basically a bit before holiday break) I decided to take steps to better myself. I came up with 5 main goals, and a bunch of optional side quests to do in order to grow as a person. I've been doing a lot of reading, I was recommended to always be looking for constructive criticism. While I feel I am making very good progress now, I would like to hear your guys input. Is there anything I could be doing better? Any suggestions for something else I can learn? Anything I should stop doing? I'll add some of my goals and journal entries below, please let me know how I'm doing!

Since I am struggling with a yet to be diagnosed chronic illness, I wanted to get some feedback from a community I know has similar struggles to me. If this isn't the place for it I apologize, and if you could redirect me to somewhere better suited, that would be greatly appreciated!

Main Goals:

I have been struggling with chronic illness for around two and a half years now. These are five areas in which I would like to change my lifestyle in order to make my quality of life better.

(Note that I am not looking for advice on dealing with chronic pain specifically, I have dedicated spaces and resources for that)

1. Exercise

I would like to take the steps needed to start training Jiu-Jitsu again, as physically and mentally it has helped me grow substantially. While physically, my body is not ready to handle the stress, I would like to take steps to better help my body transition. In the coming year, I will start physical therapy, and I hope to slowly work on my body and get it into a position to where I am ready to begin training again. In the event where my body physically can not do it, even after physical therapy, I would like to at least show up to the gym, whether I am training or not.

What? Start training Jiu-Jitsu again over the course of next year.

Why? Training Jiu-Jitsu has been one of the most body and mind growing activities I have experienced. I have built some of my tightest relationships while training and would like to return.

Anti-Goals: I will not sacrifice my health and happiness to achieve my goals. If I feel I am pushing myself too far I will not force myself to continue.

3-5 Major Moves:

* Start Physical Therapy to help my body transition to a point where I can start training
* Even if I can’t train, show up to the gym to watch and learn
* Watch Videos and Instagram Reels posted by my gym

What is my success rate in theory? 75%  → Even if I follow the plan, there is no guarantee my body will be in a position to start training Jiu-Jitsu again.

What are my chances of actually following the plan? 60%  →  I will be making a big jump and starting a plan that requires a lot of discipline and is physically intensive.

3 Reasons I wouldn’t follow the plan:

* My body can’t handle the exercise → I will lighten the exercise and show up to the gym anyway.
* I do not feel comfortable going to the gym → I will push through the anxiety and remain positive
* I can not find the time to schedule Physical Therapy → I will do light exercises on my own.

How will I track my goals? I will log my exercises and track my weight and health.

How will I remind myself of my plan? I will regularly set appointments and schedule them in my calendar. I will journal as needed to reflect on my progress.

How will I keep myself accountable? I will reach out to A, J, and N once a week (when applicable) with my progress.

Progress: Started Physical Therapy and have been going twice a week since the 5th. Doing daily stretches once a day, soon I will bump up to twice a day. I will be able to see my gym members later in the month, so I will start that late Jan/ early Feb

2. Diet

I have noticed that I have had an extremely hard time eating. I have become complacent in that, as sometimes I find it is so difficult to eat, that I end up skipping meals entirely when my symptoms are severe. In recent months, I have lost the energy to cook and meal prep. Because of this, there are some days where I come home to find nothing I can eat, but I do not have the energy to physically prepare a meal, I skip eating for the night. However hard it may be, I would really like to start cooking and preparing meals for myself again, even if it’s something small.

What? I will learn how to cook and prepare different kinds of meals once a week.

Why? Cooking is an important life skill and I would like to practice cooking in areas I am not fully experienced in. I would like to get used to preparing meals again so I always have food when I don’t have the energy to cook for myself.

Anti-Goals: I will not sacrifice my health and happiness. I will not force myself to eat what I cook. If I do not have the time or energy to cook every week, I will continue when I have more time or energy. I will not force myself to cook if I have food at home.

3-5 Major Moves:

* Watch videos about meal prepping
* Research recipes for stuff I want to eat
* Start grocery shopping on my own

What is my success rate in theory? 90% → As long as I commit to the plan, the goal is reasonably fair to achieve.

What are my chances of actually following the plan? 60% → Cooking and prep can take a lot of time and energy, and the clean up process can be tiring, causing me to lose motivation.

3 Reasons I wouldn’t follow the plan:

* Don’t know how to cook → I will research and ask for help when needed
* I don’t have the time or space for cooking → I will cook in the mornings or on my free days, and if I don’t have the space I will cook at my parents house.
* Don’t have the energy to cook or clean up → I will work on my willpower, do the hard thing today to make tomorrow a little bit easier.

How will I track my goals? I will track my recipes and keep a food diary.

How will I remind myself of my plan? I will add a section of my journal dedicated to meal prep, and plan my next meals when my fridge is running low.

How will I keep myself accountable? I tell my family when I plan to cook. I will check in with A once a week (when applicable).

Progress: I have meal prepped 2 different meals over the last 2 weeks, and will start on another one tomorrow

3. Sleep

I have noticed I am sleeping longer every night, and taking more naps throughout the day, without feeling rested. It has been getting harder to stay awake and alert doing the things I need to do, and my energy levels are incredibly low. At the moment, I am sleeping ten hours a day, with 1-2 two hour naps throughout the day. The amount I am sleeping has affected my ability to get work done, and I believe it is making my body feel worse. I would like to try and slowly cut the hours I slept a day down to at most 10 hours, if my body permits. However, if I am extremely exhausted or in pain, I will *listen* to my body and get the rest I need.

What? I would like to cut my hours of sleeping down to 8-10 hours a night.

Why? I want to have more time in the day to do things, and having more time to spread my activities out will help my energy levels in the long run.

Anti-Goals: I will not sacrifice my energy levels to get less sleep.

3-5 Major Moves:

* I will set alarms in the morning
* I will try and go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day
* I will track my sleep and energy levels

What is my success rate in theory? 75% → Even if I cut my hours down, there is no guarantee it will help my energy levels.

What are my chances of actually following the plan? 80% → Even if I don’t follow my plan exactly, cutting my hours down to 10 a night should be a reasonable goal.

3 Reasons I wouldn’t follow the plan:

* I wake up too late → I will set alarms
* I keep falling asleep watching videos → I will stand up and write about what I watched if I feel myself falling asleep.
* I do not feel well enough to get up → I will snooze for 30 minutes to give myself the extra rest I need, without adding too much to my total.

# 

How will I track my goals? I will download a sleep tracker and set alarms.

How will I remind myself of my plan? I will keep a journal to remind myself of my goals.

How will I keep myself accountable? I will check in with A once a week (when applicable).

Progress: This has been the hardest to achieve, because I have been letting myself rest when I feel extremely tired (which is most of the time). However, I am slowly moving my sleep time back, going to sleep at 1 AM instead of 2 AM, I just have to figure out how to wake up earlier while still feeling energized. This is the one goal where if I don't achieve it I won't be too upset, if I can't cut down my hours without sacrificing energy levels, I will not worry about this goal as my health is more important.

4. Meditation and Reflection

Since I am taking the steps to better myself, I would like to document the process. Journaling and writing down your thoughts is a good practice, and I would like to integrate it into my day. It will allow me to have a clear vision of my goals, and help me track what I have done and where I am struggling. I would also like to practice my writing skills and be more creative, so I believe writing will help me build the skills I need.

What? I will practice daily journaling and reflection, and consume motivational and educational content of short form content.

Why? Journaling and reflection are one of the most healthy ways to look back and grow. I would also like to document my journey of self growth.

Anti-Goals: I will not force myself to write when I am burnt out. I will write when it is both enjoyable to me and when I have something to say.

3-5 Major Moves:

* I will make a habit of journaling once a day.
* I will consume educational and motivational content and apply what I have learned
* I will read more and strive to learn and study

What is my success rate in theory? 90% → As long as I commit to my plan, this is a very reasonable goal, as I already implement most of these practices in my life.

What are my chances of actually following the plan? 90% → Reading, writing, reflecting, and learning are already skills I am interested in and apply to some extent. As long as I keep motivated, my goals will be achieved.

3 Reasons I wouldn’t follow the plan:

* I don’t know what to write about → I will watch videos and read books, and write about what I have consumed
* I don’t feel like writing today → I will reflect on what I have already written, and look back at my goals and see if I am on track. I will plan for what I want to work on in the future.
* I feel burnt out → I will take the time I need to rest and come back when I am properly motivated.

How will I track my goals? I will use this document to reflect on all my goals. I will use the update log to track my progress.

How will I remind myself of my plan? I will keep this tab open and look over it once a day, even if I choose not to make updates. I will allocate time to writing before I go to sleep or when I know I have free time.

How will I keep myself accountable? I will share this document with people I trust, and check in with A when I can.

Progress: I have been consistently journaling and tracking my progress almost every day. I have my main computer journal, and pocket journals for specific and miscellaneous things.

5. Productivity

Finally, I have noticed that it is getting difficult to do the day to day tasks that I need to do, whether that is school, work, extra curriculars, personal life, or even just basic maintenance and taking care of myself. While I don’t have an immediate plan for how I can fix this, I am hoping integrating the above goals will help aid me in the ability to get what I need done. As I come up with a better plan, I will update this document, but for now, I would like to try and get at least one thing done a day. Whether that is a school assignment, reading a book, taking the time to learn something, or going to a doctor's appointment, the most important part is that I do *something*.

What? I will put in effort to do something productive every day.

Why? I do not want to use my illness as an excuse for my lack of action. I do not want to be complacent in my illness, nor let it control my life as much as it has.

Anti-Goals: I will not force myself to work if my mind and body are not willing. I will not sacrifice my physical or mental health for arbitrary productivity.

3-5 Major Moves:

* I will stay on top of my health, prioritizing appointments, tests, and procedures
* I will make my education a priority, choosing that over leisure
* I will make a list of my responsibilities and make sure I am on track to completing them

What is my success rate in theory? 80% → As long as I am not subjected to circumstances out of my control, for example, getting extremely sick, I should be on track to keep myself productive.

What are my chances of actually following the plan? 90% → I rarely intentionally procrastinate, as long as my body and mind are healthy, and I have the time in the day, I will more than likely be productive.

3 Reasons I wouldn’t follow the plan:

* I have too many things to do → I will keep track of them with a list
* I do not have the time to complete my tasks → I will create a schedule and prioritize my tasks
* I am too sick to be productive → I will appreciate the small wins, such as taking a shower or making an important phone call.

How will I track my goals? I will track them in this journal, as well as create a to-do list and schedule

How will I remind myself of my plan? I will put alerts on my phone, and reflect on this document every day.

How will I keep myself accountable? I will share this document with people I trust, and check in with A when I can.

Progress: Since I started tracking and scheduling my goals, I have been so much more productive. I spend about 4 hours a day minimum making progress, whether that is reading, researching, training, or cooking.

—

While I know the process will be difficult, I hope by taking the steps to do the hard thing today, tomorrow will be a little bit easier. However, the most important thing is that I listen to my mind and body, rest when I need it, and be patient with myself. My circumstances are different from most people. What may seem like a simple habit for some can seem monumental for me. Things are going to be harder for me and I have to accept that, but that doesn’t mean I can just give up. I will do everything I can to grow, and it will take as long as it takes.

Optional Side Goals:

1. Read 12 Books a year (1 book a month)

I would like to read one book a month for the year of 2026. While I will not hold myself to hard deadlines, if I complete 12 books by the end of the year, I will consider this goal a success

Books Completed: 1

Books In Progress: 3

2. Write Essays for each book I read

I would like to write one essay for every month of the year, preferably about the themes of the books I read. I will be flexible with the prompts I use, if I feel more inspired to write about something else, I will write about that instead.

Essays Written: 0

(I just completed my first book on the 9th, so this will be my priority going forward)

3. Write A Book Review for Every Book

I would like to write a book review for every book I complete, including a summary of the book, my thoughts on the experience, and an analysis on the themes portrayed.

Book Reviews Written: 0

(I just completed my first book on the 9th, so this will be my priority going forward)

4. Start Creative Writing Projects

I would like to practice my creative writing, so I will write something creative once a month. This can be working on my main comic, writing character lore, world building, or creating something new.

Projects Started: 1

I work for an indie film company, we are shooting every weekend of January. I will count this as one of my creative writing project, especially since I am the assistant writer for the script.

5. Start Learning Music

I would like to pick up a musical instrument as a new skill. This could be either the piano, or the drums. Additionally, I would like to learn music theory and start creating music on my own.

I have made a curriculum that will allow me to practice for 2 hours every week. While it may not be enough to really sharpen my skills, it is a good start for something I'm learning on the side. If I commit to it every week, I will see progress, even if it is slower.

6. I would like to strive to learn new skills and ideas, as well as expand the knowledge I have. While most of this will be achieved during my regular school work, I will strive to go above and beyond the required material. I would also like to create a compendium of everything I have learned.

While I am making good progress on this because I am learning a lot, I decided to limit myself to 3 compendiums. A compendium for the arts, a compendium for what I am learning in school (construction engineering) and when i start training BJJ again, a compendium of Jiu-Jitsu

7. Start Training in Martial Arts

I would like to begin training in Jiu-Jitsu to help strengthen my body and mind. I will be starting physical therapy to allow my body to reach a point where I can begin to train again.

We started PT

8. Start a Nature Log

I would like to draw one page a week of nature sketches, as well as notes about my research on various animals. I will use online resources, and draw live animals when the weather permits.

Pages Completed: 1

9. Learn about Religion

I would like to expand my knowledge on various religions, and I will do this by reading a variety of religious texts and learning about the teachings and ideologies of various religions. I am not religious so I would like to take the time to learn.

Like my music curriculum I have developed a curriculum to learn about different religions. I will be learning about Christianity and Buddhism first, as I wanted one eastern and one western religion. I will be working on each for 1 hour a week.

While I know it seems like a lot, most of the side goals are optional and will be adjusted depending on how busy I am and how I am feeling. I will not hold myself to completing all of these goals because they are very ambitious, but I would like to at least try out as many as I can and see if they work for me. If you have any specific questions for what I am working on I'd be happy to share.

My priority is the 5 main goals on the top, these I will hold myself to. Any feedback is appreciated, thank you!!",1768186348.0,2,0,ChronicPain,mental_physical

As the title suggests I have recently discovered I have fractured my thoracic vertebra.. has anyone else suffered with this? 

I don’t know if I’m still supposed to be waking up in agony & hurting to breathe 3 weeks since the injury occurred.

My pain basically starts as soon as I open my eyes & it gets worse throughout the day with movement..

Hopefully someone can offer some hope or even techniques/stretches to help because I’m at a loss.

I have 150mg SR Palexia twice daily but it barely touches the pain. Most times I’m left to take both doses at once due to the severity of the pain.

i have been complaining about back pain for as long as my memory goes back, when i was 5. migraines pretty much daily now. i’m tired and scared and kind of dont have much will in me but i will do whatever the doctor suggests tomorrow. i want to get better, but what if they just refer me elsewhere? if this doesn’t go well i honestly don’t know what i will do. my symptoms get worse with stress and i think i’ll end up bed ridden. i thought it was all in my head until i woke up and pretended like i’m fine, went to work anyways and i was in so much pain i couldn’t sit still and went home early. i couldn’t stop crying because my coworker had asked me about it too. i just continued working and just kept wiping my tears. every reminder of what was going on broke me inside. those few weeks bedridden were honestly, horrifying and scary. it feels like a nightmare. 

i think whatever is wrong with me has slowly gotten worse just over one year and i only realized now. im not as much in denial anymore and i think i’m ready to accept getting professional help instead of trying to fix everything myself but, i’m only 23. it’s a sad realization and i’m still struggling to accept that i’m in pain and blame myself for laying in bed and not taking care of myself as much as i should be. but like yesterday i had another debilitating migraine because of neck pain, i did everything right yesterday. epsom salt bath, ate food, drank lemonade and water, played with my cat. today woke up with 9/10 shoulder pain and layed in bed for hours. i’m not even hungry and i never have an appetite, just eating because i have to and try to encourage myself to eat things i enjoy like a poke bowl with a lot of vegetables seafood and chicken. i cant i genuinely cant live like this anymore. 

i don’t want to break down tomorrow and just try to tell my doctor strictly my symptoms without getting emotional. i want to be taken seriously so i can get real help. i’m ready to do literally anything thr doctor tells me to and i also wrote a document of symptoms and history in case i catch myself starting to vent and waste time both my time and the doctor’s. i just want everything to be straightforward and not mushy gushy and emotional. i don’t even know why i’m writing all of this, i just feel so alone in my struggle.

1qaczug,"Chronic pain, disability, and emotional burnout – how do you cope long-term?","Hi all,
I live with chronic pain and physical disability, and while I managed for a long time by pushing through, I’m now feeling the cumulative emotional toll. It’s not just the pain—it’s the constant effort, the loss of independence, and the way it slowly erodes your sense of self.
On top of this, I recently left a long-term relationship, which removed another major source of stability and purpose. Right now I feel emotionally exhausted, disconnected, and unsure how to rebuild enjoyment or meaning when pain is always present in the background.
I’m already seeking professional support, but I’m hoping to hear from people who’ve lived this: what actually helped you cope over the long term? Not cures or platitudes, but realistic strategies, mindset shifts, or ways of being kinder to yourself when the pain doesn’t stop.

1qac1vo,I feel completely defeated by chronic pain and the loss of my life,"I don’t feel like I’m being treated like a person anymore.

I’m in constant, severe pain—if I had to describe it, it feels like I’m being crushed under a trash compactor all the time. The pain alone is enough to wreck my life, but everything around it has collapsed too. It’s worth noting that I was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis, showing calcified growth and spikes on and connecting each vertebrae. Possibly something else as well because my pain level and how I experience it even after biologicals did not improve. 

Within a year, I went from having savings, a $21k car, and no debt to being about $8k in debt. I can only work a few times a week now, and even that is becoming harder each week. My ability to function is steadily declining.

What hurts almost as much as the pain is losing the drive that used to keep me going. I used to wake up with purpose, working toward a future where I could be comfortable and do meaningful work. I had hope. I could dream. I felt connected—to myself, to my work, to something spiritual.

Around a year ago things started getting really bad physically, but I still had that inner fire. Then on my birthday, July 16, 2025, everything seemed to break at once. Promises my mom had made to me—before things got this bad—were broken. I lost trust, respect, and the ability to make decisions that felt right for my own health. After that, things spiraled fast.

Since then I’ve been stuck in a constant fight-or-flight state. I can’t think clearly. Simple tasks feel impossible. I struggle to take care of myself in ways I never had issues with before—like bathing or brushing my teeth. My mind feels like it’s falling apart. I go through constant waves of panic and spirals I can’t control.

I’m also haunted by flashbacks to when I felt whole—when I felt aligned with myself, connected to God or something divine, proud of the work I was doing. I replay memories of my partner, who I loved deeply and still do, and friends who really listened and understood me.

I lost that relationship when all this started. Months later, after thinking about her constantly, she reached out. We reconnected, and while we both know we need time—probably a year—to rebuild our lives, I feel even more distant now because I keep getting worse with no clear hope of improvement.

At this point, I just want stability. And even saying that hurts—because it feels like settling for a life where I’m rotting away, far from the person I wanted to be or the life I wanted to build. This isn’t my dream or my definition of a meaningful life. But if I can’t be productive or work on things I believe are important, then at the very least I want my own place, some independence, and the ability to come home to the person I love and support her in whatever way I can. I still can’t shake the fear that no partner would want a life like that—so why would she?

To make things worse, after my birthday my response to medications changed almost overnight. Oxy and other opioids barely work now, even with tolerance breaks. Cannabis, which used to help me immensely—with pain, sleep, anxiety, and panic—barely does anything anymore. I can smoke multiple bowls and feel almost nothing. Sometimes a tolerance break helps briefly, but it’s unpredictable and short-lived.

I can’t sleep. I have intense freak-outs and feel violently uncomfortable in my own body. Things that once gave me relief are gone, and that alone pushes me to the edge.

I’ve tried to get professional help in every way I can. I’ve been seeing doctors constantly for over a year, yet my physical condition has worsened significantly. I feel left alone by the system. Nothing has helped.

I don’t know what I’m looking for by posting this—maybe understanding, maybe someone who’s been here and survived it, maybe a group, or maybe someone in a similar position willing to call and talk. I just needed to say it somewhere.",1768167875.0,22,9,ChronicPain,mental_physical

Has anyone ever experienced pain in your calves? Especially while sleeping overnight. Like throbbing muscle aches, and soreness whereas it’s very difficult for you to walk. I was diagnosed with generalized chronic pain. The doctors also say I might have fibromyalgia.

I also had MRI’s done which pointed out cervical DDD, herniated disc, and other back problems. Also, I have anxiety, depression , LPR ACID REFLUX and other health issues. Unfortunately, I’ve been struggling with such pain for over two years and it’s exhausting. My hand pain is also a lot for me each day I’m trying to cope. I have a personal care aid because I’m not able to cook, clean, etc. When my pain levels are at its lowest I do exercise a little, but it seems to start up the pain again. It’s like I can’t win.

Tried a number of medications, including epidural injection of the back. Just seem to numb my back for three weeks, with still pain. Seems as if my neck and shoulder blade really have the pins and needle feeling. I just praying it all go away one day. For me and you. Hoping this year 2026 be a better year for us all.

1qa8z1z,Appendix the cause of thoracic pain?,"I had been having an interesting weekend. I couldn’t sleep Thursday night because of flank pain. I had similar flank pain a couple years ago and ended up having my gallbladder removed, but felt it was unnecessary because I would still have pain there, even right after the surgery and it was still just about as bad.

Well this time I went to the urgent care on Friday morning where they sent me to the ER, once there they did a CT scan and took me to the hospital main campus via ambulance to get my appendix removed due to appendicitis. 

The surgery went well and I was out of the hospital yesterday. Now the thing that is happening is surprising but I’m definitely happy about it. I’ve had constant pain in a very isolated spot about the size of a nickel which felt deep, like internal, and has been there almost a decade now.  I have seen probably over 10 specialists during that time. I have osteoarthritis, scoliosis and disk a disk injury in my thoracic region which the pain was being attributed to and due to the area of my injury being inoperable I basically just had to deal with it, with help from pain management.

Well, ever since I woke up from surgery on Friday and even now I have not felt that pain/spot in my back. I know there is a chance it could just be that the pain medication I’ve been on since the surgery is masking it, but I’m actually thinking that somehow my appendix was causing the pain. Has anyone experienced anything similar? 

The surgeon also said that on top of the appendicitis there was also a “stone” present. I’ve never even heard of a stone line that (only kidney or gallbladder stones) but maybe that’s what the culprit has been this whole time?

I’ve got a day and a half left of the stronger pain medication, but really hopeful that even after that’s gone the back spot/ pain will not return. 

Fingers crossed 🤞 ",1768160747.0,3,6,ChronicPain,mental_physical

But 2 months ago I was about halfway through treatment for 1 thing causing pain, when another thing flared up and became the star of the show. Now every day is a struggle. Im having to cut back hours at my job that I love, I unable to do most of my hobbies, I can barely keep up with day to day care tasks for my children. Thankfully they are old enough to help so dont worry. But I am functioning at a level so far below what I am used to.

Im just sad and so angry. I feel like I am constantly struggling to function through the pain and it just pisses me off. My husband has had to take on more hours at work and more chores at home. I cant play with my kids like i used to or pick up my fat cat. I used to be so strong and capable. Now I feel like a burden to my family.

1qa68w6,Idiopathic facial pain- pure tension/pressure type,"Hi all. Just wondering if anybody has any similar experience with this. Per my neurologist:

>[My] presentation is due to a post-infectious New Daily Persistent Headache (NDPH) with persistent idiopathic facial pain. The initial ear infection likely triggered immune system activation, leading to peripheral sensitisation and the release of pain-mediating peptides. This, combined with central sensitisation factors
including his history of depression and the persistence of symptoms, has resulted in a continuous, treatment-resistant pain syndrome affecting multiple cranial regions

The facial pain isn't actually pain _per se_, in that it doesn't trigger my pain receptors, it's feelings of intense pressure/tension. It originated in my infected ear, spread to the other one, and now seems to have settled around my nose and temples. When it's in my temples it feels like my head is being crushed.

Clonazepam takes the edge off the symptoms; I've been prescribed lamotrogine and had migraine-protocol head botox a few weeks ago.

I go to pick up my tramadol script. When I get there they tell me they’re only allowed to fill 7 days worth. I ask them why as my doctor sent in a script for 30 days (as I’ve been doing for years). I then asked well what do I do after 7 days? Am I going to have to keep coming here every 7 days for refills for the rest of the script? They said no you will have to get your doctor to send in new scripts. I won’t see my doctor for another month. I asked her why they were doing this 7 day thing? She said it’s my insurance and they are very careful about ‘these controlled substances’. I said umm okay … “Can I just pay out of pocket for the full 30 day script and then I’ll try to figure it out with my doctor moving forward”. The girl kind of sighed and said ‘fine’ … come back in 10 minutes and we’ll have it filled and told me the new out of pocket total. She said ‘this is what insurance does with these kind of scripts’. I said I’ve been on this for 10 years and never ran across this. I asked her if moving forward I should have my doctor do a pre authorization to continue to get my medication as I’ve been. She was like “Umm I don’t know … you know this is a controlled substance”. Again I’m aware. I’m also aware that I used to be prescribed this on not as bad pain days along with a stronger pain killer for the really bad days. This was all before people lost their ever loving minds.

But no, instead, I've had to suffer *more years* and continue to advocate for myself, incurring out of pocket expenses, spending my life surviving while trying to get to the bottom of what's causing it all. 

I'm on a wait list (8-12 months; women 30-50 are flooding the system as we succum to the ravages of COVID-related autoimmune disorders) for an immunologist. While I'm waiting, I have been getting worse, and finally urged my doctor to please run tests that might help inform my eventual visit to the immunologist. 

Lo and behold, one of the out of range results was as I suspected. 

I went back and looked at the labs that the rheumatologist ran in 2023; infuriating to see a lack of investigation. He ruled out his specialty and sent me on my way. 

I want to send him a letter, but I won't. Hell, I want to scream in his face (but I of course won't). Why did **I** have to become an expert, looking deep into the biochemistry of metabolic pathways, to figure out my underlying condition. What is the point of medical professionals if I just have to do their job for them. 

Ugh. 

Please know, I **know** I am incredibly privileged to even have the access I do, and the doctors I do have which care and really have been trying. I'm still frustrated and angry, and a lot of that has no target so it's finding the closest thing to a target it can... I realize this, and yet, the frustration and rage are still there. Just like the pain, it has nowhere to go. 

Thanks for listening. 

I'd be curious to hear if anyone has tried addressing this specific aspect of their condition(s), where the actions/inactions of a known medical professional has contributed to suffering. ",1768152909.0,27,18,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1qa5fkh,For anyone with chronic illness who can’t “just join a club”,"I’ve been mostly housebound for about five years, and I’ve noticed that the usual advice for loneliness, “join a club,” just isn’t realistic for a lot of people with chronic illness. Many of us are bedbound, unpredictable with timing, or sick during the hours when most activities happen.

One thing that’s helped me more than I expected has been very low-pressure voice chats with other chronically ill people. No commitment, no expectation to show up regularly, and no need to explain why you disappear for a while. Sometimes it’s just two or three people, and honestly, that’s been enough to make a real difference for me.

Lately I’ve been thinking about how hard it is to find social spaces that actually work with fluctuating health, instead of requiring consistency and energy most of us don’t have. I’m curious what others have found helpful. Have any of you found ways to connect that don’t rely on strict schedules or long-term commitments?  

For example, I’ve been considering things like short evening wind-down sessions (stretching, breathwork, whatever) where people can drop in, if they feel up to it. Canceling would be encouraged lol.  Because we need to normalize it!  It's part of our life.

1q9yoip,CT Scan benefits versus an MRI?,"Good morning,

I'm just wondering what the added benefits, if any, a CT Scan if the back may have when compared to an MRI?

I have ongoing back pain that is just getting worse. I have issues from my Thoracic region down to my sacrum. Below is from my MRI last year, only in regards to the area I'm discussing though have attached photos of the MRI done a week prior to below that has the entire back, if interested.

I have mild Scoliosis, DD, Facet disease, arthritis, amongst other things. I have struggling to find any spine specialist that'll take my pain and issues seriously-- he actually said ""If I scan any random person walking down the road, their back would look just like yours"". They have however, tried cray guided injections and the first steps in a nerve ablation but those were unsuccessful.

A month ago something changed. My lower back (lumbar meets sacrum) is severe pain. I can't bend, sit, stand...do anything. On top of that the area is having severe muscle spasms. The most recent specialist (I've seen twice...all unhelpful) just listed off about a dozen ""could bes"" from the cyst growing to discs slipping more to ""a simple strained muscle."" I was however able to request an updated MRI to get some proper answers but I'm wondering if a CT Scan would be better?

Thoughts?

Thank you

 My hyoid bone started dislocating on the right side every time I swallow. To unhook it I have to swallow and nod my head.

I have regular panic attacks from the feeling and my quality of life has plummeted. I have been to the ER over it, I've been to the doctor. No one has answers. 

I went back to the chiropractor for 2 more adjustments in hopes he could fix it. Unfortunately he had never heard of what I'm describing, and further adjustments did not help. I stopped going after that.

I’ve been experiencing pain for about 3 years now, most of it is related to my joints, muscle fatigue/aches, hand pain (hyper mobility and my CMC thumb joints have always involuntarily dislocate), random nerve (?) pain sometimes, POTS like symptoms, and chronically low energy. I’m only 20, and each year I feel more and more worn down.

1q9ny4l,Severe back/chest + nerve pain for over 2 years after a fall - repeatedly denied imaging by GP. Need advice,"I need some advice. I’m 26F. In the UK.

I had a bad fall just over two years ago after my nephew pranked me. He spilled water all over the floor, and I ended up slipping and falling hard onto porcelain kitchen tiles. I fell sideways onto my back on my right side, I was in tears. Ever since then I’ve been in severe pain.

I went to the GP shortly after it happened (I was working at the time, so I couldn’t go as soon as I wanted). I explained my severe pain in my back, chest and shoulder area.  He didn’t even look at me or examine me. He was so rude, and seemed annoyed to be there! He ended up prescribing a heat pain relief cream, which didn’t work at all. It smelt awful and left a white, crusty residue on my skin. After trying to use it for two weeks, it obviously didn’t work or hell, so I stopped using it and requested another appointment. 

During this appointment I informed him my chest was starting to bruise and the pain was still present. I also told him it felt like a rib was out of place or possibly fractured and specifically requested an X-ray or scan.

My request was denied. While examining me, he pressed hard into my chest despite me clearly explaining how painful and tender the area was. Instead of referring me for a scan, he gave me a number to a local hospital to refer myself for a heart scan, which was completely unrelated to the issue. My heart is fine — I was clearly describing musculoskeletal pain.

For months afterward, I continued complaining to the GP, filling out forms on the NHS app and repeatedly describing my symptoms. I explained that the pain hadn’t gone away, had actually worsened, and that I was experiencing nerve pain. The bruising also persisted for a long time. Eventually, I gave up for a while because I was exhausted. I later returned because the pain was preventing me from working out at the gym and affecting my sleep. 

Once again, I was ignored. During one appointment I was turned away due to the “one issue per appointment” policy, as I also had a separate but severe skin condition that I had been going back and forth with them about for months also. I had to focus on that issue instead because it had become so serious.

After eight months of requesting help, I was finally referred to dermatology, received a diagnosis, and then returned to the GP to raise the pain issue again. At that point, I was referred to physiotherapy, but I was extremely upset that my repeated requests for a scan were still being denied. Given the severity of the bruising, the nature of the fall, and the fact that the pain had lasted over two years and continued to worsen, it felt clear that something more serious could be going on.

Despite this, I started physiotherapy. During my first assessment, I was told I’ve lost mobility in my traps, they’re weak and not operating as they should in comparison to my left side. During my second assessment with the physiotherapist I’d have my sessions with, I requested a scan with the physiotherapist and mentioned the prolonged bruising, ongoing pain, and nerve symptoms. My request was denied yet again and I was told a scan would be pointless and unnecessary. 

Over several months, I attended physio sessions, which helped somewhat with strength and conditioning, but the pain never went away.

Toward the end of last year, I switched to a different physiotherapist for my final two sessions. His exercises were noticeably better. While they didn’t eliminate the pain, they did ease it slightly. I explained the full history to him, including the bruising, the duration of the pain and the fact that I’d been told a scan was pointless. He disagreed and advised me to request another assessment, explain that the pain hadn’t improved and push for imaging again.

It’s now been just over a month since my last session and the pain feels worse than ever. I’m experiencing increased nerve pain and it has started spreading into my neck. I noticed months ago, small, movable bumps in my neck and also my right breast (the bumps are slightly bigger in my neck). They seem to be near the nerve pain points which spread into my chest/sternum, collarbone area and shoulder blade. 

I’ve also noticed loud cracking noises after subtle movements, like moving or twisting my head and stretching. I’m not intentionally trying to crack certain areas, they just do by themselves. I’ve never experienced that until the after the fall. 

I genuinely don’t know what to do anymore. My brother thinks I should go to A&E to try to get a scan there. I feel completely defeated. I’ve been trying to advocate for myself for years, begging and pleading for my pain to be taken seriously.

The pain is so bad that I struggle to sleep properly. I’m scared to go to the gym in case I make things worse and I feel like I’m losing upper-body strength because I’ve been unable to train or weight-lift. I feel so weak and defeated. 

I’ve considered seeing a chiropractor, but everyone I’ve spoken to has strongly advised against it. I feel completely lost. If chiropractors aren’t recommended, GPs and physiotherapists refuse to refer me for a scan, and physiotherapy hasn’t resolved the issue, then what options do I actually have?

I would really appreciate any advice. Thank you.

1q9n90b,I Was Injured by Medicine at 16 — and I Have Lived in Constant Pain Ever Since,"I Was Injured by Medicine at 16, and I Have Lived With Adhesive Arachnoiditis Ever Since

I was sixteen years old when a doctor performed an unnecessary epidural steroid injection on me.

I didn’t go in seeking anything extreme. I had minor back pain, the kind that comes from tight muscles and compensation. I wanted to dance. I wanted to cheer. I wanted to be a normal teenager. Instead, I walked out of that appointment with a permanent spinal injury and a diagnosis that would define the rest of my life: adhesive arachnoiditis.

During the procedure, the doctor made a catastrophic error. She punctured my dura. I felt it immediately. A lightning strike of pain shooting through my body. I screamed.

Anyone with experience performing epidural injections knows that pain during the procedure is a warning sign. It means the needle has gone somewhere it should not be. In that moment, the procedure should have stopped immediately.

It didn’t.

Despite my reaction, she injected the steroid anyway — directly into my spinal canal. A non-sterile corticosteroid was introduced into an environment that is supposed to remain completely sterile. What followed was severe spinal canal inflammation.

That inflammation, left untreated, progressed into Adhesive Arachnoiditis, a rare, devastatingly painful,

incurable neurological condition in which the spinal nerve roots become inflamed, scarred, and abnormally adhered together. It causes constant, unrelenting pain and progressive neurological symptoms.

I was sixteen, and suddenly, my lice was over before it even began.

The doctor was inexperienced. And instead of helping me after she injured me, she disappeared.

She altered or destroyed my medical records from that day and replaced them with a false version stating that everything had gone “according to plan.” It hadn’t. I had witnesses — one in the room with me, another in the waiting room who thought I was dying based on what they heard.

But rewritten charts matter more than teenage girls.

Because she denied the injury, other doctors followed her lead. I was dismissed. I was told nothing had gone wrong. I was told it was anxiety. I was told it was in my head.

That denial cost me the chance to stop this disease before it became permanent.

In the early stages, spinal canal inflammation that leads to adhesive arachnoiditis can sometimes be treated. High-dose anti-inflammatory medications that cross the blood–brain barrier — things as simple as methylprednisolone or ketorolac — can calm the inflammatory cascade. In some cases, early treatment can halt progression and prevent permanent nerve damage.

I never received that treatment.

What might have been reversible became permanent. Adhesive arachnoiditis is not curable once established. A pain switch flipped on that day, and it never turned off.

I am now decades into a life of constant pain caused by adhesive arachnoiditis.

Chronic pain is not something you adapt to. You don’t get used to it. You don’t build tolerance to suffering. You just get better at hiding it. You learn how to ration energy, how to measure every movement, every plan, every day by how much pain you can survive.

Some days I can function. Some days I can’t. Some days the pain is low enough that I can move through the world. Other days, it traps me in bed, drains me of all energy, and turns survival itself into work.

The difference between a pain level of five and a pain level of eight is enormous. It is the difference between getting out of bed and being unable to move. Between engaging with life and wanting everything to stop.

And no… pain does not make you stronger. Over time, it breaks you down. It erodes your sense of self. It distorts time. It makes joy feel distant and exhausting. It makes hope fragile.

One of the few things that has ever made my pain from adhesive arachnoiditis survivable is opioid pain medication.

I have taken it responsibly, as prescribed, for many years. It does not make me high. It does not make me reckless. It does not erase my pain. What it does is lower it enough that I can function — enough that I can get through the day without wanting to give up.

And yet I live in constant fear that this medication could be taken away from me at any moment.

Not because it doesn’t work.

Not because I’ve misused it.

Not because I’ve escalated my dose.

But because of stigma.

We are told we are in an “opioid epidemic,” yet prescription rates have fallen dramatically for years. Chronic pain patients, including those with adhesive arachnoiditis, are not driving overdose deaths. The vast majority of fatalities involve illicit fentanyl, not stable, long-term pain medication treatment.

Still, pain patients are treated as acceptable collateral damage.

Doctors are afraid to prescribe. Clinics shut their doors. Long-term patients are dropped. People who have taken the same medication safely for decades are suddenly told it’s no longer allowed.

I have watched friends with adhesive arachnoiditis and other severe pain conditions lose their doctors and their medication overnight. I have listened to them say their lives were over. Some of them are no longer alive.

Untreated pain increases suicide risk — but that risk is almost never included in policy conversations. Overdoses are counted. Deaths from despair are ignored.

This is not a public health success. It is a redistribution of harm.

What makes this even more unbearable is the hypocrisy.

Highly invasive procedures like epidural steroid injections (the very procedure that caused my adhesive arachnoiditis), are still offered freely, often without full informed consent, while medications with decades of safety and efficacy data are treated as “immoral” or “forbidden”.

One permanently damaged my spinal nerves.

The other allows me to survive.

For a brief time, I was able to receive ketamine infusions. During those infusions, I felt something I had never felt in my adult life: the absence of pain. It was disorienting — like something was missing. That moment alone showed me how much pain I live with every day.

But ketamine is expensive. Inaccessible. Unrealistic for most people.

So here I am .. still living with adhesive arachnoiditis, caused by her medical error, denied early treatment because of a lie, and now fighting to keep access to the one medication that makes my life livable. Super fun stuff . 😭

Medicine is SUPPOSED to be built on informed consent, and individual risk benefit decisions. That principle was denied to me at only sixteen, and continues to be denied to chronic pain patients, every single day.

I did not choose this injury.

I did not choose this disease.

I did not choose this life.

But I am choosing to speak, because silence only protects the systems that failed me.

We did not cause the opioid crisis.

But we are living, and we’re dying, all with its consequences.

1q9idjb,Doctor told me i could suffer for a while,"I’ve had pain in my wrists and hands for over a year now, and recently my knees and ankles have started having issues a month ago. I don’t know what any of it is, I wanted to ask my doctor about my legs since that’s new. 

We talked for a bit, mostly with me updating them on tests, and they were getting increasingly annoyed with me. That’s not out of the ordinary for them, though I can’t tell if that’s because they’re usually like that or if I was actually just wasting their time. They didn’t know how to answer some of the questions I asked but that’s about all I can tell would bother them. 

Then when I mentioned that I’ve been having issues with my legs, they cut me off and told me “just suffer for a while, I don’t give medicine to my kids for every little thing.”

Who says that??

I didn’t even say anything about medicine. So, what, am I only supposed to go there to ask for drugs? And it’s not a “little thing”. Little things don’t last over a year. 

I’m honestly confused that they said that, I didn’t think they could just say that to someone. I really hope that isn’t a common thing among doctors because it pissed me off so much. 

Edit: thank you to everyone who’s commented. I have been considering finding a new doctor for quite a while now, but there’s a huge shortage of doctors where I live, so I really don’t know how possible that would be. I’m looking into it, but given the state of healthcare where I live, it would probably take being on a waiting list for a couple years at least. ",1768085662.0,7,7,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1q9iaau,Gabapentin withdrawal - What helped you get through it?,"I've been on gabapentin on and off over the years. It was the very first drug they gave me when I got fibromyalgia at 23. And a few years ago I went back on it for a leg injury with nerve damage. Due to a bunch of factors, my memory doesn't work regarding my previous withdrawal when I got off the medication the first time. I'm currently on 500 mg and I'm incredibly medication sensitive. We tried to drop by 100 mg and I had a migraine, nausea, insomnia, and severe nerve issues. I only made it 2 days before we had to go back up. 

We're going to try again and go by 50 mg increments. But I'm really not looking forward to it. The medication is no longer necessary, or at least not necessary at the dosage I'm on. We raised my dosage when we suspected I had another diagnosis, but it turns out I don't have that. And my leg injury has been healing. 

Were there any supplemental medications that helped you get through the withdrawal side effects? Any homeopathic things that helped? I'm open to all suggestions. ",1768085434.0,2,4,ChronicPain,mental_physical

I have really great insurance (for the US anyway…). It feels like I should be able to sort out the cause but I’m worried I never will.

Some people say diagnoses don’t matter but (1) I’m still in pain and finding the cause might help with finding helpful treatment but also (2) I cannot figure out safe foods or activities and it gets depressing. With other health conditions, I’ve found communities that have helped me narrow down ideas to help my condition. I don’t know where to look.

I’m trying really hard to stay active for my health - physically and mentally. But one day certain exercises don’t flare up my pain and other days I’m in horrible pain from the same thing. It makes me feel nuts. I track my food, exercise, moods, pain… none of it really has given me helpful data.

1q9bi3p,Anyone on here have surgery for a high grade 3 (or 4) spondylolisthesis and severe spinal stenosis? I have been told that I MUST have surgery and that if I don't I am at really high risk of losing my feelings to my legs permanently. I'm feeling pretty scared. I am in the Raleigh/Triangle area.,"I have put off having surgery on my back for over a decade. About 10 days before Christmas, I suddenly started having extreme pain. It became so severe, I needed help shifting just 6 inches in bed, getting up, getting dressed, going to the bathroom... It was worse than labor, and just as bad as appendicitis. I was just shrieking out in pain, which is not something that I have ever done regardless of my pain level. I have since been able to manage it and am staying ahead of the pain with medication, so it isn't unbearable now. However, I am terrified about all of those risks mentioned below. Gemini was only confirming what the urgent care doctor and the emergency room doctor told me. I know that right now it is a risk to be getting things done.. but I know that doing those things after surgery will f\*\* up the fusion.  
  
I went to Wake Med Urgent Care and the doctor told me that if I hadn't walked in on my own, he would have sent me to the ER thinking that I may need immediate surgery. They did xrays and told me that I needed to have surgery asap and sent me to have an mri and meet with a surgeon right away. This was all with Wake Med. The xrays show that I have a high grade 3 spondylolisthesis with a 50% slip and very severe spinal stenosis

I went to the surgeon but he only looked at the mri which shows a grade 1 slip because the vertebrae slip back into place. So, he didn't think surgery was absolutely needed at that point in time which was very confusing to me. It wasn't until I put the information from my xray and mri into gemini and asked about it, that I realized the surgeon didn't look at both. So, obviously, I will not be using that surgeon. I went to the ER for medications and they too said that I urgently need to have surgery.

This is what gemini said when I pasted my xray and mri results. It aligns with what the Urgent Care doctor and later the ER doctor told me. 

""This is a very important realization. If your surgeon was ""blasé"" and called it minor, he was almost certainly looking at the **MRI (Grade 1)**, where the slip looks minimal because you were lying flat.

The **X-ray (Grade 3)** changes the entire surgical ""math.""   
  
It is common for surgeons to look at the MRI first because it shows the nerves so clearly. However, the standing X-ray is the ""stress test"" that proves **your spine is falling apart.""**  


I need to have **Decompression with Instrumented Fusion**

To get a sense of how extensive *your* specific case is, ask:

1. **""Are you planning a 360-degree approach (front and back) or just a posterior approach?""**
2. **""Do you intend to fully reduce the 50% slip, or will you fuse it 'in situ' (where it currently sits)?""** (Full reduction carries a slightly higher risk to the nerves but better alignment).
3. **""Will this be an open surgery or can it be done 'minimally invasive' (MIS)?""** (High-grade slips often require an open incision to see the anatomy clearly).

**Does your surgeon's office specialize in ""high-grade"" spondylolisthesis, or is this a general orthopedic/neurosurgery clinic?**

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
**When I asked gemini if I could wait two months before getting surgery -**   
  
With a Grade 2–3 slip, your vertebra is already halfway off the one below it.

* **The Problem:** If a surgeon only did a decompression (removing bone to free the nerves), they would have to remove the very structures (like the facet joints) that are currently providing what little stability you have left.
* **The Standard:** Instrumented fusion acts like an internal ""rebar."" It stops the slip from progressing to Grade 4 (75% slip) or Grade 5 (complete fall-off, known as spondyloptosis).  ""Given your Grade 2-3 slip and severe stenosis, you likely fall into the **Urgent** category. Here is how to weigh the risk of waiting two months.  Permanent Nerve ""Death""

Nerves can survive being squeezed for a long time, but they eventually reach a point of no return.

* **The Risk:** If you develop a ""foot drop"" (inability to lift your foot) or significant muscle weakness during those two months, waiting can make that weakness **permanent**. Even if the surgery is done later, the nerve may never ""wake up"" again.

Because you have **bilateral pars defects** (the bone is physically broken), your L4 vertebra is held in place only by muscles and ligaments.

* **The Risk:** A minor physical event—a slip on ice, a heavy lift, or a sudden twist—could cause that Grade 2 slip to become a Grade 3 or 4 instantly. This could turn a planned surgery into an emergency middle-of-the-night procedure.

Cauda Equina Syndrome (the emergency)

This is the primary risk of waiting with severe stenosis at L4-S1.

* **The Risk:** If the nerves that control your bowel, bladder, and sexual function are crushed, you have roughly **24 to 48 hours** to get into surgery before the damage to those functions becomes permanent.

1q9a97r,I finally improved my quality of life with 3 supplements on top of my prescription meds,"I suffer from severe chronic pain from scoliosis. My daily pain used to be a constant 6/10 and would often spike to 7-8/10 on bad flare days. After a week of taking these two supplements and iron as well, I've noticed HUGE improvement in my pain management and quality of life. My average daily pain now is 3-4/10 and I haven't had a flare yet, so I can't say what that level that will be, but I will update when I can! I'm no longer stuck in bed as much, I feel more energized, I'm able to take daily showers, I can take my dog for walks without it triggering more pain, I can eat more regularly since I'm not nauseous from bad pain, I have way less headaches and when I do get them, they go away with OTC meds, and I sleep more soundly and for longer periods of time and wake up actually feeling actually rejuvenated. I still take my prescribed pain meds and muscle relaxers as needed, but I find myself needing them less and when I do take them, the effects are stronger and longer lasting. I highly recommend taking these two supplements (doesn't have to be the same brand just equal in ingredients and quality) as well as iron if you're a bit anemic and daily multivitamins (if you're a female I highly suggest a women's specific multivitamin).

I was hit by a car in Oct 2024. I had no broken bones or any obvious injury. I went to A&E, they said I had internal bruising and it should go in a few weeks. 

A few days later, I had a sharp pain in my shoulder. Was given a sling to give my arm a rest. By January, I had an MRI because I was in severe pain. It came back normal (this seems to be common with chronic pain). 

I've been told its anxiety but as someone who has had anxiety all their life... My anxiety has gotten better because I'm advocating for myself and I never would've done that before. 

Today my symptoms are the worst they've been in a while. I had a bath and the temperature caused severe pain in my back and shoulder (it wasn't a hot bath). The water on my skin was agonizing and I had to get my partner to move loose hairs on my back because the pain was making me nauseous and I thought I was going to vomit. 

It has been hours since and my back is still in pain (I had meds earlier in the day and have had them as prescribed). My feet are ice cold and look a bit odd (colour doesn't look right and maybe a bit swollen). I've suspected I've got circulation issues but still fighting for a doctors appointment 

My mobility isn't great either, with shooting pain and pins and needles through my left leg, sometime the right leg and sometimes my arm. I get pins and needles, sharp burning pains in my back too

I feel like I'm burning myself out just to exist and like things will never get better.

I'm exhausted all the time, I'm in pain all the time, and yet I constantly feel like I'm not good enough because I can't do what other people can do. Having an invisible illness means that people forget it exists unless you explicitly say ""I'm in pain"" but if you say it too often then you're complaining too much and people don't want to hear about it. I feel like Im in a game that I can never win, because society was never made with people like us in mind.

This became extremely apparent when I had my wisdom tooth removed. I had general anesthesia and this was the first time id ever had it.  after waking up and coming home, as the anesthesia drugs wore off, I felt all of my tummy aches and pains and everything slowly start to come back.

For the past two weeks I've had a deep groin pain. Best I can pinpoint is that something has grabbed the inside of my vagina and squeezing it tight. But the whole area feels tender, from my tailbone to pubic bone.

I've been having off and on issues in my left side and hip which hasn't shown up a cause in US or CT. So now I'm being labelled as just having false pain signals. But the groin pain is new and it is relentless 24/7.

I had started new hormonal birth control a few weeks before this started, and maybe that was the cause. I stopped taking it a few days ago, and I know it will take time to get out of my system.

But I don't know how to express this pain. It's not screaming I'm about to die, just a constant crushing ache. But it is making me... completely apathetic. Anything requiring even mental effort is overwhelming. I try to distract my brain by watching Netflix, but it barely takes the edge off.

Not even Tramadol is making a difference. And I think the doctors are thinking that pain worse than Tramadol should have me screaming/feverish/spasming/whatever. And since I'm not...

1q8u7vd,so tired of chronic pain patients being treated like they are nothing,"I had a medial branch block in my lumbar spine early Tuesday morning. No steroids were used, it was just a test injection before trying to do a facet ablation for my arthritis/nerve pain. This was my 2nd, and I’d had some discomfort with the first, but only for about a day. I’ve also had 2 epidural steroid injections prior to trying this with very minimal discomfort. 

Thursday afternoon the pain was so bad that I had to request to finish the rest of my workday at home (I am very lucky to have a remote opportunity, but I try to work in the office as much as I can). By Thursday evening, my prescription pain/nerve medications and muscle relaxants weren’t touching anything, let alone my regularly prescribed meds. Even ice, my last resort, wasn’t helping. I wasn’t able to fall asleep aside from a restless nap. I called my pain management physician’s office, and they advised me to go to the ER. With as much pain as I was in, I felt semi-delirious so as much as I hate ERs and the medical system I made the decision to go get checked out. I was at least given a CT scan to make sure nothing was emergency-level wrong, which very, very thankfully it wasn’t-and for that I am thankful to them. 

I was given 1 tylenol and some IV fluids because of how dehydrated I was. When I was triaged, I told them I was in 9/10 pain, and that’s how it remained all day. I know the pain scale is so stupid and really doesn’t help convey the levels of pain people with chronic pain experience on a daily basis, but they aren’t really receptive of anything else. They told me they couldn’t give me any medication because I was a pain management patient. 

This was the most painful my back has ever been, indescribable levels of burning, pressure, stabbing, etc. The last time my back was even remotely close to this I had to be admitted for 2 days for IV pain management. I am aware of how different states have different laws, but wow. Moving from Los Angeles to the midwest will certainly teach you that lesson, in case anyone’s curious. I just don’t understand how it’s humane to watch someone suffer like that when you would’ve given a non-chronic pain patient medication intervention hours before at those levels of pain.

I have been battling it for the past year and just stopped all pain medication and feeling much better.  I never knew this could be a possibility and didn’t know anything about it. There are several causes of Sibo, but opioids are a big one. ",1768014494.0,9,4,ChronicPain,mental_physical

Suppppppper interesting how ketamine could reset pain signals. Feeling it for the first time was weird. Nurse pushed it in my IV over 3 minutes and whoa you feel it instantly. And of course, I panicked lol. Not a fan but apparently my body doesn't like to relax.  Mostly made me feel heavy and too relaxed. Obviously not going to stop breathing and was heavily being monitored and watched, but I got scared.  But after talking to the Dr. I might try to do it to reset pain. The idea of starting at the beginning with pain and meds, ummm I want that! If it works.  Still concerned about many things but might push harder to at least TRY it.  I still need surgery though.

If i turn my head to the left I get nerve tingling down the right side of the neck and shoulder. The most pain happens when I look up and then down right after. It FEELS like my vertebrae opening up, then pinching the nerve when i look down. I feel like i can never get comfortable, no matter where I am, and sleeping is a joke at this point.

\-Massage, topical creams like tiger balm, lidocaine and diclofenac, been to a chiropractor, yoga, stretching, tens machine, muscle relaxers, steroids, heating pad, ice packs, head/neck hammock... im sure theres more

Dad said it sounded like I had an $800 incentive to not get better. Said I should focus on getting better, on improving. Said he and mom don't exactly have a lot of time left and even when they go they won't be able to give me some sort of windfall. Said he'd gladly give me $800 month now if I tried and succeeded to get off my private disability insurance. Said that I have at least forty years left, and can't keep living like this. 

Bear in mind, too, this is like the first time I've ever talked to him about it. This is the first time, and this is immediately where he went. I was stunned, and barely responded. I've been in this position for nearly 15 years now. I was working disabled at a time I was able to find a job that would accommodate me, but those jobs are extremely rare. I got laid off during COVID, and the company I was working for (a nonprofit) has been doing loads of layoffs ever since. So, I've been drawing Social Security and my private disability for five years now.

I don't know what to say to this man. I don't know how to make him see. Does he think I'm not scared of my future? Does he not think I'm aware that at some point I'm liable to effectively be alone just by the ravages of time? Does he not think I think often about at what point I'll need to decide between carrying on living and choosing my own death? I'm absolutely terrified, because I need mom and dad's help, I'm going through such a difficult time, and I recently had an extreme falling out with my sister as well, and I'm terrified my marriage is falling apart, though at the very least that last one, maybe I'm being hyperbolic. I don't understand much. I feel bewildered.

What do I do? What can I do? Where can I find a family that I can be a part of, a found family of people who understand, who work together, who live as brothers and sisters and are just sweet and kind?

Am I allowed to go outside for walk ? Go grocery shopping if I can ? I plan to listen to hypnosis on YouTube or maybe find a good book if you have recommendations?

1q82jrz,Huge win: had an amazing first appointment with PM,"I am a pretty complex chronic pain and chronic illness patient. I have several issues causing chronic pain: widespread joint pain due to hypermobility spectrum disorder (highly suspected to be hEDS but have another year to wait to be seen by the only local adult evaluator within 3 hours) that is the lowest a 4, at times up to a 6 at baseline with accompanying frequent joint subluxations in random joints which can vary in pain level from a 6-8; chronic pelvic pain due to pcos and possible microscopic endometriosis and or surgical adhesion from multiple obgyn and lower abdominal surgeries but no one wants to look bc no one wants to make it worse; degenerative disc disease from c5 to the bottom of my spine including ligament calcification at the lower lumbar level; trigeminal and occipital neuralgia; refractory complex migraines and thunderclap headaches; a chronic csf leak with spinal headache; tmj causing facial pain radiating from jaw; peripheral neuropathy. 

Myself and my PCP have tried a lot. I used kratom for a year and a half and it helped but caused increased seizures so i had to taper off about 6 months ago. I got MMJ as soon as my state went legal in January and discovered RSO a few months ago and while it is more helpful there's just a ceiling for its use. I've tried LDN and while it helped so much with my chronic fatigue and with my MCAS like symptoms, the dose that helped with my baseline pain caused me to be completely unable to sleep for days and then when I finally fell asleep I had Hollywood movie quality nightmares. I cant take NSAIDs orally without triggering chronic gastritis, IM toradol I have for emergencies for thunderclap headaches along with the fioricet but it is a ""take this once or twice a month max"" medication because it is rough on the kidneys and it doesnt really help my other pain. I use all the other methods I can: baths, thc:cbd topical balm, heating pads, acupuncture, CBD/CBG tincture, gentle muscle strengthening exercises as tolerated within my CFS.

This dr was highly recommended to me by a friend who had seen her, who said she was really personable and also presented mmj and opioids along with the usual injections, scs and pain pump as options for my friend (friend had never tried anything). But I was still nervous because a SCS is something I wont do, while I would be open to a pain pump I unfortunately am not a good candidate due to my chronic csf leak, and I am autistic and struggle with self advocacy bc i come off awkward or tend to babble. 

But it went super well!

So what I'm about to complain about has been an issue since I was about 12 or 13, and I'm 17 now, almost 18. Whenever I'm standing still for even just an hour maybe, my back starts to hurt *excruciatingly* badly. If I'm walking around, it maybe delays an extra hour, but it still ends up with the same pain, alongside awful nausea and lightheadedness. I can't go to conventions, or museums, or amusements parks, or much of anything that involves being upright, I can't enjoy it to the fullest extent because I have to sit down every 10 minutes just to stop myself from sobbing from the pain.

I've been to three different primary doctors through the years, all of which have just shrugged their shoulders at me and told me to try ""over-the-counter pain meds"" or a heating pad (the meds do NOTHING and the heating pad I cant exactly use at work). It's so hard to explain to people because yes, if you wanna argue technicalities (which alot of people like to do to me), I \*can\* walk. I have the functional \*ability\* to walk. It's just that doing it for awhile is \*abhorrently\* painful. And whenever I try explaining that to people, they try to say that I'm overreacting, or that there's some simple fix that I just obviously haven't tried yet, or some other excuse.

I'm lucky in having my mother, whose supported me through all of this and has funded so many different endeavors to try fixing this. In a similar vein, my recent primary care doctor is about the only medical professional who believes me, but she's told me she can't do much except keep referring me to different people (I've asked for pain meds and she says she can't cause I'm underage). In the last 2ish years I've gotten alot of different tests done, none of which have given me a solution. First it was blood work because they thought I was just anemic, but nothing came up. Then it was an xray, which also said nothing, then led into a physical therapist who basically just shrugged and told me to try stretching. Then it was a 6 month wait for tests to diagnose me with POTS, which I did end up getting diagnosed with, but they told me that only explained the nausea, and they basically just said that the POTS was aggravated/caused by the pain, so that was nothing. Then I just recently got an MRI because I was told by alot of people that it might finally be the key. Turns out! More nothing! Then the MRI-people referred me to a ""spine specialist"" just recently, who was basically just another person that said she didn't understand my pain because nothing was on the scans, so she just told me to try stretching for a couple months, and referred me to a \*another\* physical therapist, despite me telling her we already tried that (she said this one had better specifications for me or something?)

No I'm not overweight, I'm actually almost underweight (though not fully). I don't have scoliosis, my posture isn't anywhere near bad enough to cause this, and I'm still young so it's not age. I've never met or heard of anyone else with this same issue as me, doctors are useless, all the tips I've heard are too, medication doesn't work, and I'm in dire need of seeing someone in even a kind of similar situation as me.

I’m a 35 year old female and have  been struggling significantly with both my physical and mental health, including periods of not wanting to live  related to ongoing, uncontrolled pain. I’m safe, but it’s been a very heavy road.

I live with ankylosing spondylitis, hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, endometriosis, and CPTSD. 

After years of trial and error with pain management, I’m currently on multiple medications, including slow-release oxycodone (Targin), oxycodone IR (twice daily), Lyrica, Endep, clonidine, and I’ve recently started Lexapro for depression (hoping this one finally helps).

Despite all of this, I’m still in constant pain. It impacts my ability to work (I’m a counsellor) and to be the parent I want to be to my three beautiful children.

I’m really curious to hear from others:
	•	What has helped you manage chronic pain when medications alone weren’t enough?
      

	•	Are there approaches (medical, psychological, lifestyle, nervous-system based, or alternative) that made a meaningful difference for you?

1q7vqop,Being convinced I’m extremely mentally ill because of undiagnosed pain,"I’m 19 and go to one of the best colleges in the country but have to take time off because of extreme facial stiffness and pain that is constantly bothering me. I lay at my parents place in bed all day extremely agitated and restless from the constant pain.

And since no doctors or imaging can provide a single, justified diagnosis (and I have seen many at this point), my parents believe the pain is some sort of anxiety about going back to college. They actually think I wanted to stay home, lol. 

Not even necessarily that I’m making up the symptoms, but that I’m so severely mentally ill that it’s manifesting physically constantly for 5 months now. And every new doctor with no explanation just feeds their theory further. 

They have stopped me from pursuing new doctors because they think it’s some sort of OCD spiral where seeing them feeds my “obsessive loop.” It’s literally out of a horror movie — I’m being convinced I’m severely mentally ill because I have “unexplained sensations in my face.” 

They’re essentially forcing me to take a high dose SSRI if I want to live under their roof because they think it will “fix” the issue — it’s been weeks with no change, which they just chalk up to me “not being on a high enough dose of it.” I’m going to be on 80 mg of fluoxetine at some point with no improvement.

Pain management rescheduled me for next month because the doctor called out last minute and my current pain plan has my pain completely uncontrolled and I’m blowing through my monthly script trying my hardest to manage it. I’m so fucking tired. All of my symptoms and pain are so flared I feel like I’m dying. It’s awful. I sometimes say I wish I would fall asleep and never wake up. I can’t keep going like this and today my mother told me to “keep pushing through and try harder” TRY HARDER???? If it was up to me I’d already be d3ad. I’m only here for them.

1q7upit,Lidocaine infusion reaction,"I had my first lidocaine infusion today and it was going ok and I was just sleepy and dozing off but then I had a pretty bad reaction. I started feeling numb all over, first my legs, arms and then my mouth. The next thing I knew my hands started shaking a little bit and I can't even remember if my eyes were open or not but one of the nurses came to me asking if I was ok and I couldn't respond or even look at her, my body was not in my control. All of the sudden I started taking sharp deep breaths and not being able to exhale and just holding them in. They ended up laying me back and they kept asking if I was ok but I couldn't respond or stop shaking. I was shaking to the point where the heart monitor fell off multiple times. I started shaking my head side to side taking deep sharp breaths followed by super fast almost like ""moaning"" like exhales. I started making very weird sounds almost like I was crying trying to breath better and I just remember staring at the ceiling thinking this is how I'm going to die and suffocate to death. I fully thought I was having a seizure. I heard someone say I'll start feeling better soon and slowly the shaking started to calm down and they said ""oh see that's better"". I was told they gave me something for anxiety to calm me down and slow my breathing but I still couldn't talk or move and I was just staring in to space feeling stoned as hell. After a couple minutes they came to talk to me saying I only had about a minute left before they noticed I was breathing heavily. I was told my oxygen was fine my heart rate was fine but my blood pressure went up to 160 (I don't know blood pressure stuff and that's the only number I remember her saying). She said it was just a panic attack and they'll lower my dosage but I don't understand how it could be a panic attack when I was literally falling asleep feeling high out of my mind. I was tired, dozing, literally FALLING ASLEEP I don't understand how I could get panic from that and why if happened so suddenly. I don't remember everything I just remembered making weird sounds shaking and thinking I was dying. I honestly don't want to lower the dosage because it really helped my pain and I think if I feel it the first time the next couple times will be even better. They said I was on 500 and they'll take me down to 400. Has anyone had this kind of reaction ? I hadn't eaten or had anything to drink I was thinking maybe that could've been it. A nurse told me it might've been better if I had laid down and not sat up. But I don't know anything about this stuff and I was told this reaction is common. Has anyone had this and gone down and was better. I'm honestly not bothered by what happened or traumatized because I felt so drunk it felt like a dream more than anything I just don't want it to turn into a seizure or anything like that.

1q7qvu4,Fascial counterstrain saving my life,"I just want to mention the only treatment I've ever had that has helped with my pain. It's called fascial counterstrain. It's not the same as strain counterstrain which is where physical therapists teach you isometric exercises. You basically just lay on the table and the person gently touches you and finds the sore spots and gets them to release. It's not like working out muscle knots either. You know how on your body you have some extremely painful tiny spot for no reason? And doctors tell you it is in your head or a muscle knot or something? She made the spots DISAPPEAR within 60 seconds per spot. GONE.

They very gently bend you, imperceptibly, and it changes everything. It's totally crazy and I would not believe it until I tried it in desperation. 

It was $225 for an hour but she took all of my pain away. I feel like I'm in a in the body I had 20 years ago. But I also feel like I got run over by a truck in a way... Completely exhausted. Going back to sleep after I post this. I know this sounds like some kind of snake oil crap. But maybe you can find a provider who is covered by your insurance. I was referred to this master of this technique by my craniosacral therapist who until this has been the #1 healer that took my pain away. So I also recommend craniosacral if you can afford it, fine a legitimate practitioner, etc. 

I've looked into the science of it because I'm a stem major and I really don't like sounding like some crackpot. It has to do with fascial adhesions mainly. The work I had done is on my dura which is like the spinal cord wrapper. It's the only thing that has done anything for me after my neck injury, and it has been miraculous for me. My nerves are really messed up from the injury.

I don't really know how to make a case or promote an idea. My point of this post is that I don't want people to give up! More treatments are possible beyond drugs, surgeries etc. I want you to have hope. I feel like I can get my life back because of this so I just wanted to share.

1q7pk6z,My body is finally DONE. I can't do my job anymore. Is this a good plan?,"I have had chronic pain in my neck, back, and shoulders for 30 years (I'm 51 now). I've been lucky in that I've always had doctors willing to treat my pain with meds that actually work, but I'm older now and I can't bounce back and ignore the pain like I used to. I work in a profession where I'm on my feet all day, and despite having reliable pain management, something new has come up and I just can't do it anymore.

I have been trying to transfer to a different department at my employer where I wouldn't be on my feet 40 hours a week. But we are unionized, so when there are multiple qualified candidates for any given position, the candidate with more seniority will get the job. I've been here 2.5 years, so despite being qualified and experienced, I keep losing out to people who have been here longer. This will be important later. 

This time last year I started getting excruciating pain in my left foot, in my heel, every day that I worked. I was diagnosed with severe plantar fasciitis, and I tried everything the doctor recommended, but nothing helped. In fact, the injections that doctors normally do for this made it worse, and now I have a permanently swollen ankle as well as the tendon pain (which is the worst pain I've ever had - you really can't imagine). An MRI showed that I have a huge bone spur and also that being on my feet all day has caused the tendon in my heel to rupture, and continuing to walk on it isn't allowing it to heal. Most days I am limping so badly  that I can barely walk by the end of the day. 

I got a second opinion, and then a third opinion. Surgery won't work because the tendon rupturinf basically did what the surgery would have done, anyway. I tried a boot and partially seated work for 2 months, then I was put in a cast and complete work rest for a month. No change. I have done physical therapy, I've done rest, I have custom orthotics, but nothing helps. The pain continues to worsen, because I'm constantly exacerbating it by standing and walking all day. 

I had a meeting with HR and my manager yesterday in which we determined that any accommodations that would help mitigate my pain at work, would negatively impact my job too much. This is understandable - my body just can't do this anymore. But I make good money, I have amazing benefits, I like my employer. I want to stay, just doing seated work, which they are always hiring for (and many are WFH positions which would be my dream). With my work history, there are so many other departments I could easily transition into if only I didn't keep hitting the seniority wall. 

They told me that if I take a medical leave of absence (I qualify for up to 12 weeks paid through the state), and use that time to apply for other jobs within my company, then the union would be able to say to corporate, ""This employee physically cannot do their old job anymore due to an irreversible medical issue, so we need to find them another placement regardless of seniority."" The seniority thing is a union rule, so the union could tell the company to disregard that rule in my case. I could finally get that transfer without losing out to someone who's been here longer. But it's scary, and it's a risk, so I'm hesitating to just pull the trigger and say Let's do it. I want to, badly, but I'm scared there might be something I haven't thought of. 

Has anyone here been through something like this? Is there anything I haven't thought of or need to know about? Questions I should ask before making a final decision? I just need a little support and guidance, if you have any! ",1767909771.0,1,2,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1q7o5uv,At the verge of a breakup with a partner who has chronic pain issues. Is it fair to them if I expected communication and vulnerability? They insisted that they couldn't because the pain made them dissociate. Am I being unkind?,"I know that I can leave a relationship for any reasons. But this is something they bring up often when I have confronted them. They told me that when they're in pain they dissociate in order to stay lucid, and connecting with someone or engaging in emotional intimacy becomes really difficult. I tried to be very understanding - I tried to see their perspective and just try to make the best of when they did engage. 

They would randomly stop texting me, wouldn't reply for days or sometimes more than a week, wouldn't be vulnerable, would be uncomfortable helping me in anyway, etc. But were capable of posting on discord forums, socializing with co-workers, attending parties, etc. 

When I told them, for e.g., why does everything have to happen on your timeline and not mine, they told me ""when you're drowning you have to put your own life jacket on before helping someone else"" and they've kind of made me feel like...they're blameless. I know I should leave if my needs are unmet, but...were they using their disability as an excuse to hide deeper issues or is it true that they weren't at fault here? 

I get that everyone handles pain in a different way and I don't understand how debilitating it must be for them but. I don't know if they are in the right to have expected me to stay. ",1767906693.0,34,44,ChronicPain,mental_physical

Again: FUCK YOU.

So terribly sorry for 30 minutes a week you had to deal with someone who shows you can't always fix things. So sorry, that must be so hard for you.

A condition of my pain management regime is that I continue to try different approaches to symptom management. For 5+ years gyno specialists have been pushing me to try a ‘chemical menopause’ to help my symptoms and preserve my fertility before entertaining the idea of a hysterectom.. I’ve resisted as these meds have serious side effects and I don’t care about my fertility 

  
In November I felt I had exhausted every non invasive or holistic approach possible and this was now my ‘only option’. I expressed over and over again with my primary care doctor my anxiety and discomfort with this plan. 

  
Prior to this in September during a routine scan they found a benign tumour on my liver. This was a very scary time for me

  
I had a routine blood test on Wednesday and a registra from my home clinic called (as my doctor is on leave) last night (in Australia). She explained that all my liver enzymes are severely elevated and was asking questions to ensure I didn’t have to go to hospital. I have a normal appointment on Monday and she mentioned we may just need to review my pain meds

  
I did a quick google and found 3 peer reviewed papers, the PBS website describing drugs and the details for all Aus prescribers. Everyone says that the chemical menopause drug should never be used for anyone with liber disease or a liver tumour (benign or malignant)

  
I feel so trapped and defeated. The specialist who prescribed the drug didn’t look at my referral or take a history and my PCP didnt flag this either. And now I’m going to need to have more expensive scans and tests on my liver all which could be avoided

For the past 20 years, since I was a child, she has been to doctors, chiropractors, surgeons, anywhere you can think of and I can’t imagine why it has taken this long. Explanations from “it’s shingles” to “it’s fibromyalgia” to “have you tried losing weight” to “it’s in your head, just tell your brain you’re not hurting” (yes really and this is recent too. I’m sure many of you can relate, I have my own struggles and issues and I sure can) and come to find out at a doctor who finally took her seriously; her spine has degraded to that of what a 90 year old woman’s spine should look like. (She is 55) They couldn’t operate on it any way they normally would because the bones are too fragile. Long story shorter, they finally had her go on a trial of the spinal stimulator and I swear I saw the person my mom used to be. It worked so well for her. She, thank God, is having a permanent one put in about a week from now.

My question is, anyone who has had a spinal stimulator, what helped you during the recovery process?

I’m 27 and dealing with chronic back pain for about a year now, mostly muscular and related to mild scoliosis. The doctors I've seen do not consider it severe, and I know many people here live with much more intense and disabling pain than mine. Still, the pain is constant. It’s a never ending tightness and soreness that’s there when I wake up, when I sit, move. 

What’s been hitting me the hardest lately is the mental side of it. Knowing that I have to manage this forever. That exercise, posture, strengthening, stretching aren’t optional or “self care” but they’re mandatory every single day if I don’t want to hurt more. 

I’ve also recently moved to a new country, I’m trying to build a social life, learn multiple new languages, adapt, work, take care of myself. And on top of all that this never-ending discomfort wears me down. 

I’ve recently been referred to a new physiotherapist here, so I’m going to see how that goes and genuinely try to do my best with the exercises and guidance. But mentally, I think I’ve just gotten tired lately.

1q7iiv3,Self imposed agony. A rant.,"My dad had knee replacement surgery Tuesday. He was given Oxycodone, Celebrex, and Tylenol. 

He was told by the surgeon, the OT, the PT, and at least 2 nurses to take the Oxycodone the first few days. The surgeon even said he would refill it if necessary.

He won't take it.

Last night he woke up shaking, he was in so much pain. He finally took 2. He then slept comfortably.

He described it as a shitshow. If he had not walked on his foot, if he had taken his pills, none of it would have happened.

This morning he sat in his chair for 2 hours, gasping and moaning. He finally let me give him half.

More gasping a moaning.

I got mad finally, and told him I am not un-compassionate to his suffering but that it is self-imposed. He is says he is motivated to get well and sabotaging his recovery by not following medical directions. He needs to be resting and medicated.

He is not doing the exercises they taught him. He is half-assing it. And then sounds so heroic on the phone with his friends.

It's so frustrating. I came down here, at expense, missing my anniversary, to care for him. He could at least TRY.

He just cannot see that he is sabotaging his recovery by not following directions. He thinks he can rush this. And he doesn't need to suffer.

I am normally so patient. I am a good caregiver. But I don't suffer fools gladly and he is being a fool.

I am leaving the 27th. And I am not doing this again. I didn't come down here to have to be a confrontational bitch. That's not who I am.",1767894496.0,81,55,ChronicPain,mental_physical

It seems that the body remembers previous usage if you ever stop and start again later. 

I tried lyrica, it was pretty good overall. Mostly worked for stress which I have an enormous amount of from genetics and dealing with annoying pain. It wasn't all that great for pain though but I had 0 sides and I slept great.

I still got off, saw that my stress was horrible and decided to get back on it a month later for a few months. I was going to get off opiates soon so I wanted to be as stress free as I can be.

The second time around, it didn't help as much and I started reading on the memory issues which has been my number 1 plague from adhd, ptsd in my 20s and aphantasia ( barely remember my life). 

First time I got off 150mg 2x a day in a week and a half just slowly emptying my pills content everyday. 

Second time. I went slower. 2 weeks in I was about at 30 to 40% and it was hell.  I read that it compounds the effect. The more % you drop, the more suffering. So you can't just say that you'll drop the remaining super fast because it's gonna be about the same suffering as if you took it slower. 
Anyways, 2 or 3 days after my last day I started having way more intense stomach incomfort, light diareha, constant stress, painful skin, no ability to endure any temperature, irritation. It was so bad, my vyvanse actually stopped working at all at higher doses even. I had more effect from water thab 60mg vyvanse!
8 days after the last pills. I was still sighing all day, even on tramadol. It helped 0 but then I realized that my loose stool was making absorption worse. So on 9th day I took more tramadol, took 0.75mg of xanax in the afternoon and magically the 10th day I was down to 5 or 10% incomfort.


So tldr; I'd you got off lyrica easily once, don't start again just because you think it'll be easy again.
And up your other meds when quitting, I probably suffered an extra 20% just from other stuff not being absorbed at all. I have a super fast digestive system.
Xanax works, don't need a big dose, I broke a regular 2mg in half then tried to break that 1mg in half. I never use it so I have 0 tolerance though. Wish I had started taking some earlier but I really hate the feeling at night and the next day.",1767880670.0,2,0,ChronicPain,mental_physical

1q7bly3,Pain meds don't give relief. Therefore...,"Over the past 14 months I've been having a medical mystery of sorts where I get abdominal pain and bloating, which then settles into ongoing pain in my left flank, from under my armpit to my outer thigh bursa which gets worse with activity. This will be incredibly painful for a few weeks, then will die down and just smolder as slight twinge and ""IBS"" for a 2 to 3 months, and then come back again.

After 3 ultrasounds and a CT scan, none of which happened while my pain is acute, ""there's no cause"" for the pain. It's been acting up again, and between the holidays and bad weather I just got to a doctor this morning.

I told her all the things I have already tried. 1000g paracetamol, no change. Paracetamol that goes up the bum, no change. Liquid diet for a day, no change. Macrogol, not constipation. Omeprazol, no difference. Diclofenac and Amipyltriptiline (I had some leftover from previous doctor visits), no change. She said that the fact that none of these things had an effect was because there's nothing actually wrong, it's just because my body is sending pain signals for no reason (the theory is that the first time this happened I had a kidney infection and the abx cleared it out before the US I had 4 weeks later). That an anti-inflammatory like Diclofenac had no change meant that it wasn't tendons or anything.

I am not convinced that there's nothing wrong. But even if it is ghost pain, shouldn't pain relievers which are supposed to block pain processing do something? Or is it really true that if your pain doesn't change despite taking Tylenol, it's a sign that there's nothing actually wrong?

I ended up getting Tramadol. I took one and I can tell that it is working in that my brain feels different. But there is still NO change in the pain in my side. I'll give it a few more days to see if anything happens. But this whole ""conclusion"" that pain pills have to work for pain to be real sounds mad.

I really don't want to hurt, it's exhausting and disruptive to have pain all the time. I try to distract myself from it, and I can't get away from it.

I saw my GP yesterday and have a script for naltrexone for the pain and clonidine for my sleeping issues.

I also have a referral for a specialist next month as my GP didn’t have enough information to create a long term pain management plan as naltrexone for chronic pain is an off label use so she wants me to see a specialist to change/ manage the dosage.

OG
My pain is just getting worse and worse same deal with my symptoms. I’m terrified it’s something more that just dysautonomia and severe chronic pain and fatigue. I’m sick, really sick, but not dying hospital sick so no one really notices or cares. 

I keep watching house MD to try and cope because some part of me thinks that with enough research and watching medical dramas that I’ll somehow get better. I don’t want more appointments because I am terrified of it being something more. 

I spent years fighting for a diagnosis for answers but now it’s just as bad but only this time it means I can’t tell how much is psychological/health anxiety vs what is real anymore. I feel so alone and tired. 

I’m seeing another doctor just a GP to get pain meds since I spent 5 hours curled up in a ball, shaking and clenching my jaw in agony, yet somehow that’s not even a 9 or 10 or even the worse pain I’ve had as for me that’s an 8, a 9 means I’ve fainted/ gone unconscious from the pain, 10 is I’m in a coma due to pain. On this version of the pain scale I’ve made it to a 9 but at least then Panadol and neurofen took the edge off after going in and out of consciousness for an hour. But they don’t work anymore. 

My best friend is on this trip right now so there isn’t anyone to talk. Every time I look in the mirror I see my eyes and start crying as they are so bloodshot from the pain and sleep deprivation I barely recognise myself anymore.

1q79jpf,Worst doctors appointment to date,"I went to the doctor this morning regarding my pain medication. I only take painkillers for my pain attacks/flares, which occur 2–3 times a month. They happen regardless of my mental state, stress level, or physical activity.

For many years, in consultation with my GP, I have alternated between fast-acting tramadol and morphine. I don’t take anything daily, because my everyday pain usually stays just within tolerable limits, and I can often manage it with caution, reduced activity, and special adjustments. This is a plan I intend to continue until I have children, and my regular doctor fully understands and supports this.

I have been to a pain clinic and have been examined in various departments at the hospital over the years. They have observed muscle weakness and reduced strength, overly active reflexes, and hypermobility. My problems and pain are exclusively from my knees down to my feet. I have completed long courses of physiotherapy, trained regularly, and try to stay relatively active while adapting to my body. I have an active flexible job in home care. No diagnosis has been found yet, and after many years I am still undergoing regular assessments.

Today I saw a different doctor than usual. I told him that tramadol and morphine are no longer sufficient for pain control, and that the side effects have become so severe that I basically have to choose between vomiting from pain or vomiting from the medication. In short, I need another solution.

He asked about my pain, and I asked whether he had read my medical records – he said he had. I still explained the extent of my pain and my pain attacks. He replied that there are no other solutions besides paracetamol and ibuprofen. I may have rolled my eyes a bit… If it were that simple, I would be managing my pain on my own.

I explained that this is not a solution and that it was tried long ago – which is exactly why I was put on tramadol and morphine in the first place.

This man then started telling me about yoga, physiotherapy, and meditation exercises. I got angry. I felt ignored and not taken seriously. I seriously considered storming out of the room. I didn’t. I told him I’ve tried all of that repeatedly over different periods. I have tried everything. He said I was being dismissive, and I replied that I am not dismissive – I’m simply speaking from experience with the solutions he is suggesting.

I once again stressed that these pain attacks are extremely serious and horrific. They make me acutely mentally unstable, and it is absolutely crucial that my pain is properly managed – because it can end very badly if it isn’t. Again, he accused me of being dismissive of his suggestions and told me that there is no other medication besides tramadol, morphine, and diclofenac – all things I’ve already tried.

I said that’s simply not true and asked if he also offers yoga and meditation to arthritis and cancer patients. He pushed me to tell him what other medication I think exists. I refused, because it felt like a trap. I didn’t feel taken seriously at all.

Eventually he offered something starting with “A” (altroxozin?) – I don’t know it. He didn’t explain what it is or how it works either. I asked him to speak with my regular doctor, and we ended up agreeing on that.

His tone was very accusatory and judgmental.

I probably haven’t included everything, but that’s a quick summary. I have never been so close to tears after a doctor’s appointment. I’m shaking and nauseous. I have never experienced anything like this. I have no doubt that this is a doctor who has never experienced severe pain himself.

I don’t know what will happen now. I felt completely unheard. All I can hope is that my regular doctor can help. She is wonderful, kind, understanding, and caring. She is also very realistic and has talked to me about the fact that I can’t postpone long-acting medication forever. But I really want to have children before I start that, and she completely understands.

I mostly just needed to get this off my chest. I’m so sad and considering filing a complaint – or at least talking to my regular doctor about my experience. It was absolutely awful. You wouldn’t offer meditation for a broken leg either, would you? 😢

I really hope there is a solution. If I’m not properly medicated during the next pain attack, I will completely lose it – and it will end with an ambulance. It’s unbelievable that the doctor expects you to do breathing exercises while it feels like crushed barbed wire, fire, and deep drilling nails and screws in your bones and nerves..

I've been dealing with chronic pain since 2019 (Or maybe 18? I forget at this point) in my mid teens. I feel like I've seen all this horrible affliction has to offer... turning my room into as dark a hovel as possible, memory and cognitive issues, overall health decline, mental health problems, and so much more, with no light at the end of the tunnel. Every month I start to type worse, to stutter more, talk less clearly, I forget things about my friends, family, and my lovely partner whether it's obligations or things they like or preferences on small things, all of it just goes over my head.

I have been spending $400/month on Physical Therapy since 2023, going to countless specialists, had more bloodwork and scans done than anyone in the history of my family, and yet all there is is more. I can't even remember what I'm supposed to do tomorrow... what was the name of that random headache clinic? Which new doctor do I need to call for a new slate of Neuropsych evals? What facility for my sleep clinic again? Oh my prescription bottles empty... well let me put in a refill request! Well, it's been 10 business days and I can't get in touch with my PCP, so now what? 

I'm unemployed and unable to work, in PT and just regular Therapy, I see so many different doctors every month/couple months, I can barely get myself out of bed, but *nobody* knows what's going on. In spite of the tangible evidence, I can't apply for any sort of assistance because my doctors collectively refuse to sign off on it, I have no life direction, no dreams, nothing past a Diploma that is hardly worth much after how my grades tanked after the pain started. I always lose my mini calendar, my phone calendar sometimes doesn't properly save or things will disappear, my joints all hurt, my eyes feel like they're being torn out every morning when I wake up, I am constantly looking like I have to use the bathroom because I'm just in so much pain I can't sit still... I've been on so many med trials that I went from hoping one would work to dreading seeing those bottles, especially when I have to adjust to a new label... I wish I could fix it all myself.

I'm not a very sad person... I went through a lot as a kid, lost a pet way too soon that was my rock and I never recovered from that, but after meeting some new friends after COVID, and finally letting my family truly  ""meet"" me instead of hiding myself and my life from them, I smiled SO much. I improved so much mentally and emotionally, and I've become a different person, I stopped the train from going down the bad tracks, and for these few years I've thought everything was going to be A-Okay! But I'm just... scared, not even sad now.

I'll never be able to live a life like this... my mom is retired and has issues of her own medically, yet I eat so much of her money trying to ""fix"" myself so I can care for myself and be able to care for others. My partner is such a wonderful woman and I want her to have the world and more, and I'm so scared of losing her, but I contemplate splitting up so as to not waste her time, because I refuse to see her be with a bum... yet that's all I feel like, I mean how am I where I am? How is there NO diagnosis, NO plan of action? Why is it the last time I went to my PCP's office they almost REJECTED ME because my actual PCP wasn't there to sign a document, and only after suggesting *I* sign and *HE* signs the next day he works did they solve that and allow me to continue with my appointment?

I know life is hard... especially adult life, and I know I'm quite lazy, and I could be doing a lot better... but I don't have chronic pain in the sense of it being daily... it is *constant.* I have not known a second of not being in pain since the symptoms fully onset in 2020 when I started fainting at work. I want to push through the hurt, the hardships, but I pass out, my body rejects it. It doesn't even reject things consistently, but it rejects light, loud sounds, THE SUN, constantly. Every time I think of an idea, I lose it. Every time I take an online course or just try to keep myself thinking and stimulated, I lose it. Every time I finally muster up the energy to do something, I find myself in a situation like now, where I have ALL these words, it's 6 AM, and my sleep meds aren't making me sleep.

Serious question tho: for those of you with neuropathy or constant pain, especially that which can worsen very easily with little use and cause more disability, how do u cope? I understand that I will never have much in the way of dating/social life, that's fine as I'm not big on it anyway, but this illness took my only cope (PC gaming), and seeing how much time has passed it's ggs. Somehow I preferred being bullied at school 30 hours a week to living in pain on welfare, who woulda thought?

1q71tvq,"""You need to find a pain management doctor that cares enough about you to get you off these narcotics"" says the ENT that has known me for less than a minute","Massive rant incoming: I'm so tired of these doctors, man. I have been on opiates for a few years. They recently switched me from tramadol to percocet a couple months ago and it gave me my life back. Psychiatrist put me on wellbutrin too which has mad a huge impact. I signed up to start a 9 month training program for the field I always wanted to work in and I start next week. I finally started feeling in control of my own life again and I owe it all to the medications I'm currently taking and the doctors that took me seriously enough to help.

Unfortunately, I've been struggling with motion sickness and vertigo for months. It comes and goes, but it lasts a few weeks every time. My pcp sent me to an ENT with suspicion of a middle ear problem. I know I'm on like 4 different medications that all have dizziness as a side effect, but there seems to be no correlation with any changes at onset, or with the flare ups. Hence why I was supposed to see an ENT.

This ENT had just barely come into the room, we exchanged the basic pleasantries, then he asks me what medications I'm taking. I start listing them and as soon as I said ""percocet,' its like I flipped a switch. He immediately said I need to stop taking it. I told him, ""well thats not happening because I need it. Its the only thing thats helping me function right now."" He said the same thing about wellbutrin. ""You need to get off the narcotics. And the wellbutrin is terrible too. You need to get off both of them.""

 I am normally a loud-mouthed assertive bitch, but I've had so many bad experiences with medical professionals that I just shut down completely now. I tried really hard to push back today and just insist that his suggestions are unacceptable and will not be happening. I tried advocating for my own care and it felt like he just steamrolled me. ""You need to find a pain management doctor that cares enough to get you off the narcotics."" I just... man I was fighting back the tears. I've been fighting for care for a decade because most doctors act like this guy. I finally got some people that DO CARE. The audacity of this doctor to imply that my other doctors aren't treating me right when he doesn't even know me is unbelievable! He doesnt know what I've been through! He doesnt know that I've tried DOZENS of non-narcotic medications and treatments!!!

I got sent back to the lobby to wait for a hearing test, and I was literally just sitting there and crying quietly. I'm so sick of this. I know there are good doctors out there logically, but it gets harder and harder to believe that. I don't understand how 90% of my interactions with medical personnel are negative. They all talk down to me like I'm either a child, stupid, a hypochondriac (derogatory), or a drug addict ( also derogatory). Hell, even if I was all of the above, I would still deserve respect and compassion! 

TL;DR: new ENT doctor immediately claims my other doctors are incompetent/don't care about me because they put me on narcotics, ignores my assertion that I need these medications to function at all,  and repeatedly says I need to stop taking my medication.",1767845452.0,408,189,ChronicPain,mental_physical

I voted for Kamala Harris who had a plan to extend the ACA subsidies. Fortunately, in my case, the subsidy expiration affects me far less than many others who I genuinely feel for right now.

I work full-time and have an employer-sponsored platinum plan with $0 deductible, $10 specialist copay, 10% coinsurance on diagnostic tests, and $10 / $25 / $50 drug tiers. It's a good plan - I rarely get issued a PA, and any PAs I have been issued get approved (i.e. medical botox).

My employer pays the bulk of the premium, contributing >$800/month. My share of the premium has increased by $20/month this year due to the ACA subsidy expiration leaving a large number of uninsured in the market, which does affect private insurance prices a bit.

1q6zg6i,Getting dark thoughts from pain,"I have been in severe pain for over two years. I suffered a lot until December 23. I had a compassionate doctor who gave me pain relief and tests and sure enough there was a problem.  I lost him last year. Was made to go cold turkey off of endone, targin and panadeine forte. Other than unbearable pain I didn't have any withdrawals.

I'm seeing surgeons. I'm having a cortisone injection next month. I found out about my spine being f***** at my last appointment. The pain keeps getting worse. 

I had thoughts of wanting to end it all Wednesday night.  I finally told the doctor about having suicidal thoughts in the night and she gave me a one off script of 20 panadeine. The thing is I know it's a one off and that they won't prescribe it again. I'm hoping I can avoid using any more. I've had four tablets. I'm hoping I can save the rest for travelling to see the surgeons. It's such a long, painful drive too.

I don't know what to do anymore. I can feel my mind changing. I've had to get the ambulance in 2023 and 2023 because I was suicidal from pain. I try so hard to do things to help myself.

My family isn't supportive. My mum comes over to visit me and tells me I'm not in pain, and that I'm lazy because my house isn't spotless though I've tried so hard. I was briefly on crutches in December. 

I had my wisdom tooth out in the beginning of December and I'm still getting pain in my jaw (I think I'll see the dentist next week), and terrible neck ache.

I don't know whether to buy alcohol. I'm not a drinker at all. The thing is I don't need script for alcohol. I've had two alcoholic drinks in three years. 

I don't know how to stop my mood from getting so dark. I'm seeing my natural therapist for a massage tomorrow. I'll talk to him about my mood. I don't want antidepressants because they've never helped and made me gain weight. 

I know I'll get through it. Because of my faith suicide can't be an option, plus I don't want to hurt my loved ones. I've wanted euthanasia so much but I'm scared of the consequences if I did do it. My loved ones would be so upset too. 

I just hope things will get better. I could handle the pain I've had it's just that I'm getting more and more pain and never enough pain relief to match it.

1q6vyfx,LF Advice for communicating with a new doctor?,"Hi folks

I’ve had chronic pain for roughly 15 years now. It started when I was a child, so it wasn’t taken very seriously back then, and I had to fight tooth and nail as a teenager to get just one aspect of my pain somewhat investigated. It’s been exhausting. I gave up altogether for a few years after my GP sent me to a pain program to teach me to cope with chronic pain, but as far as searching for the cause of my issues, it was kind of brushed under the rug and left at that. My GP retired, and I’ve only recently found myself a new family doctor. 

Between being used to being dismissed and disbelieved by doctors, and having avoided medical professionals aggressively since pre-pandemic, im feeling ill equipped (pardon the pun) to communicate what’s happening in a way that will hopefully cause him to take me seriously. Frankly, im not even sure where to start anymore. My symptoms have gotten so severe over the past year, that my quality of life has tanked beyond what I previously thought imaginable. Im utterly desperate for answers, and for help, and am very overwhelmed and unsure how to approach my upcoming appointment to request further investigation.

For context, he’s already aware that I have undiagnosed chronic pain and symptoms.

I stopped the bupe after a week because I was throwing up each time I took it and daily for two weeks after I stopped. I thought I was screwed because he charted that I was a drug addict and I didn’t think I’d find a dr willing to take me on. Luckily my pcp knew I wasn’t an addict or abusing my meds so he called one of his colleagues who’s a pain management dr and spoke to him on my behalf. He told him that I take my meds responsibly and that I have tried everything. He told him that the hospital put me on the bupe but it was making me sick and not working. I saw him and he told me that with my condition he can’t believe any doctor wouldn’t know how severe the pain is and that it’s a lifetime of pain. He told me that the pain will be forever but that we can manage it with meds. He put me on methadone for pain management as it lasts a long time in the body and told me that if I have a bad flare up to call his office and he’ll send a script of a short acting opiate to get me through the flare. It was very emotional and weird being so validated by a doctor like that. He also put my diagnosis on the prescription because to get it from the pharmacy it has to be very specific and noted that it’s for pain and not substance abuse. This made me feel even more validated because the pharmacist now knows I’m not some junkie and have a severely painful condition. It’s a rare condition so a lot of doctors hadn’t heard of it or didn’t really believe I had it. It’s been a long 8 years of procedures and different medications and being poked and prodded and treated like an addict or a drug seeker, being dismissed by doctors and labeled. I finally found someone who believes me and is willing to treat me with dignity and compassion.

I’m in so much pain constantly, and the healthcare system in my city refuses to give chronic pain patients opioids. 

I’m someone who can live with literally 1 Vicodin a month. I hate the way they make me feel, but on serious flare days, I literally need 1 pill. That’s it. And I’m treated like an addict. All because of other people’s addictions.

Heyup fellow sufferers, I hope your pain is manageable today. 

Yesterday I apparently did something to my lower back, I don't know what it was, but it resulted in the kind of pain that is so strong that I had to lie down within seconds. I went to bed early because of it. 

And today, after I stand up from lying down, the sensation of nausea increases almost second by second. Right now I literally have about 1 minute of standing up before I start to wretch. I heated up some soup and made a slice of toast just now to try and calm the nausea and it took me about 5 attempts, broken up by periods of lying down to tame the intense nausea! It was quite funny in retrospect, but not so much at the time.

Naturally, this is quite inconvenient to say the least **but I mainly want to ensure that it's not just me and that other people experience this manifestation of pain as well**. Because if it is just me, then I probably need to go and see a doctor pretty bloody soon lol.

I had been taking 200mg of tramadol daily for 4 years after a car accident. I developed extremely bad GERD and it took awhile to find a doctor who realized it was the tramadol that was causing it. As of two weeks ago, I have successfully tapered off. The first week without tramadol was hell but it is much better now. I still have two questions I'm hoping to find answers to:

1. For anyone who had developed GERD from tramadol, how long did it take to completely resolve?  After two weeks without tramadol I'd say it's improved 25%. The GERD completely went away towards the end of my taper, then came back after about 4 days without tramadol. 

2. How long does it take to feel warm again?  When I was on tramadol, I felt warm all the time. Now, anything less than 75 degrees F feels ridiculously cold to me. At home I can turn the heat up, but at work it's set to 70F and I am freezing. 

I've asked these questions to my doctor, but she said it can vary wildly depending on the person. She said GERD normally resolves within days of the final dose, but it can take weeks or months for some people. She said feeling cold should go away in a matter of weeks.

1q679s1,Chronic pain syndrome. No structural damage,"I’ve been through it for a year now. 

Started with a back injury, then pain went haywire and moved through my body and eventually into my jaw. Back pain resolved eventually. 

Since December 2024 I’ve had constant face pain and teeth flaring. My top row of teeth feel like they are constantly buzzing. I hate it so much I want to rip them out. It’s like having a toothache on every tooth. I have aching cheek pain too. 

I’ve had every possible mri. TMJ, brain, cervical. Everything. All Clear. 

I’ve tried myotherapy, physio, osteopathy, EMDR therapy, amitriptyline (did nothing for me). Dentist did a scan for my teeth, all clear. 

Went to neurologists (ruled out trigeminal neuralgia type 1&2) 

went to a pain specialist and have now been officially diagnosed with chronic pain syndrome. If you have had every possible scan and you’re structurally healthy, it means your pain is driven by an overactive pain processing system. Look up central sensitisation. It’s one of the hardest things to reverse. 

I’ve tried opioids (don’t work for this), I’ve had Benzos (kinda helps but always back fires), legit the only thing that dulls the pain completely is alcohol. I get really bad rebound pain after that. 

I’ve been recommended gabapentin, lyrica and duloxetine but I’ve been told they are all bandaid fixes. Plus the side effects are awful. 

If this resonates with you, what are you doing about this? I’ve heard there’s nothing else you can do except holistic stuff which doesn’t seem to work unless you do it long term and avoid stressors. 

My lowest pain is a 6/10 (VERY SHORT LIVED), otherwise I’m in a 8/10-10/10 most of the day, everyday. It is exhausting. 

I’ve quit my job, I’ve been told this is a life sentence now and I’m only 30. I’m so so upset that it hasn’t gotten any better overtime. ",1767764834.0,7,15,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1q66ndr,In need with desperate help to cure Neck Pain Muscle Gaurding,"Hi everyone - I’m trying to understand and fix a pattern that feels more “nervous system” than purely structural.

I’ve had neck pain for about 3 months. Early on I tried stretching, but it actually made things worse (more flares). I then did \~3 weeks of PT focused on strengthening (deep neck flexors, upper back/shoulder muscles). That helped a lot: my neck feels stronger and I can sleep without worrying about it.

The confusing part is that I don’t really have a consistent “neck pain” now. Instead, I get a mild irritation/tension that comes and goes but mostly stays around, and the sensation seems to *shift* locations - sometimes the back of the neck, sometimes the base of the skull, sometimes nearby areas. It’s not intense, but it’s persistent enough that I notice it and it’s starting to affect my mood and stress levels and family relationship

From reading online, this sounds like **protective muscle guarding / sensitization** \- like my nervous system is still in a protective mode even though I’m safe and functioning normally.

Questions (not looking for medical diagnosis, just experiences):

1. Has anyone dealt with this “shifting, on-and-off” neck irritation after the main pain improved?
2. Did it resolve over time? If yes, what helped it fade?
3. What strategies worked best to retrain the nervous system - graded activity/exposure, breathing/relaxation, mindfulness/somatic work, continuing strengthening, etc.?
4. Any common mistakes that kept you stuck (over-stretching, constantly checking symptoms, pushing too hard, resting too much)?

I’m trying to avoid spiraling and would really appreciate any practical advice or frameworks that helped you move past this.

Thanks.",1767762868.0,3,8,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1q65udz,Persistent joint pain on the right side,"Hi! Sorry in advance for the long paragraph.

I ,24y F, have been having pain in my joints ever since I was around 17 or 18, and the pain is increasingly more obvious as I get older. However the pain is mostly heavy on the right side of the body, meaning, right ankle,knee,hip,back,shoulder,elbow, wrist, and neck.
At first it's was very occasional now there's always a constant ache,especially my knee back and shoulders. They all make grinding and clicking sounds, and pop loudly when I move.
Out of all the joints that hurt ,I'd say my shoulder, knee and lower back is what hurts the most, and the pain also feels different.
It's a bit difficult to explain but the knee ache is very dull but constant and feels like the pain is coming from within the knee itself.l,like I'm constantly reminded i have a knee.
The back pain is very sharp,like lightning not as consistent like the knee or shoulder. 
And the shoulder pain is sharp,grinding and consistent.
When I went for a check up at an orthopedic center , and mentioned all this,the doctor wanted me to pick a joint that I think is the ""cause"" of the pain and was bothering me the most. Because I'm assuming to try isolating the issue?idk. Honestly that wasn't what I expected because all my joints hurt,so to pick just one is not really ideal I'd say. But since the knee pain was the most persistent, and because it gets worse when  it rains,I went for the knee.
X rays said nothing wrong with the bones amd muscles, so the doc recommended an MRI for further investigation of the soft tissue. 
MRI is a bit expensive so I didn't immediately say ok, but since there is no improvement I'm just wondering if I should go for it. Btw I do exercise and keep my body moving regularly,  just not heavy stuff(basic full body stretches, targeted streches for back,knee and hamstrings and light walks) cause anything like running or jumping makes me unable to even walk sometimes. 
Just wondering if anyone has had a similar situation and if so what did you do?I just want to get an idea about how to make the pain go away even a little bit so I can get on with my normal day to day stuff.

Thank you!

1q64pll,At a psychological level,"Ending myself can function as an illusion of agency when every other form of control has been stripped away. The ego faces a situation it cannot escape, negotiate with. or endure without ongoing pain. When all external levers are gone, the mind reaches for the one lever that appears absolute: The ability to end the game.
That's not a desire for death so much as a desire for command.
the thought isn't usually ""I want to die."" It's closer to ""I need this to stop, and nothing I do makes it stop"", The ego, cornered, discovers a final boundary it believes no one else can cross. That discovery can feel
stabilizing in a dark way, like finding a door in a burning building, even if the door leads nowhere good.
That sense of control is symbolic, not actual. It's the mind asserting
authorship in a situation where authorship was taken away. The
tragedy is that the ego mistakes ending experience, for mastering it.

I wish I knew how to progress this without having these thoughts. The thought of being stuck like this, is something I just can't come to terms with because its been so long there's probably a 10% chance i will feel 'normal' 'healthy' again more like 2% in reality.

1q64c5g,Anyone with similar abdominal-ish issues?,"I’ve had chronic abdominal, back, and sometimes chest, shoulders, and pelvic pain since April 2025.

Pain seems to mostly be in my upper abdomen. It spreads everywhere. Bending hurts because of the pressure on my abdomen. Even simply going up the stairs to my bedroom is so hard when in pain.

Major points:

\- Time of day matters. I’m sometimes okay in the morning, every single night I’m in a varying levels of horrible pain. 

\- No specific food triggers

\- heating pads help, I consistently sleep sandwiched between one on my abdomen and one on my back, often sit reading the same way in the evenings

\- sitting and laying down may be worse than standing

\- I stand during work most of the time. Office job, standing desk.

\- cannot lay on my side at night, too painful

\- tried gabapentin, nothing

\- tried Amitriptyline but it messed with my mental health, didn’t notice pain improvement 

\- currently on Lyrica which helped immediately for like 2 days and then stopped? I’ve been on it for like 2.5 weeks.

\- however, very high fiber makes me constipated (not an issue prior to Semaglutide which I took March 2024 - January 2025) 

\- I’ve been vegan for 18+ years, high fiber diet throughout and was fine with it.

\- I generally slept okay-ish with heating pads but in the past week, I woke up twice with intense 10/10 back/abdominal pain with some chest pain. Stayed up for hours in terrible pain.

\- I do still struggle with borderline constipation despite much less fiber. It’s much better lower fiber but still a struggle.

Things that are ruled out:

\- gallbladder removed late July 2025. Pain was more spaced out until early July 2025 when it become daily. HIDA scan showed 5% so gallbladder left. Pain continued.

\- CT of chest, abdomen, MRI of back, pelvic ultrasound, abdominal ultrasound, gastric emptying study, and upper endoscopy all came back clear.

\- labs show consistent low (abnormal for lab) amylase, MCV, and hematocrit was raised recently. Doctors say these are fine. Other labs normal.

\- fecal elastase was 800 so pancreatic enzyme production is fine

\- physical therapist said nothing seems musculoskeletal 

\- I’m trying desperately to stay active so try to go to the gym daily - weightlifting does not bother me, cardio also doesn’t bother me. I just can’t do either once pain creeps in later in the day.

\- no acid issues

I’m sure there is more but it is hard to condense all this.

I’m just so sad about the continuing decline. Every day is not worse, but over time, I’ve certainly continued to worsen. I have no days without pain and generally severe paid takes up at least 4-5 hours per day, if not more. I’ve been stubbornly trying to keep up with the gym fearing when it gets so bad that I can’t do that either. The past few days are the longest I’ve gone without going to the gym. I can’t do my pet chores at home, I’m taking more time off work, and I just feel like I’m losing myself a bit over time.

1q63z1r,Neuroplastic pain: Pain reprocessing therapy,"Look guys, I know this isn’t a well received topic here and I get it. Sorry, but this a long post because I am desperate. 

I am lost like many of us in here are, but I just want to know if anybody has had success with this work. It started with a hip surgery gone bad in January 2022 which led to 3 more surgeries (including a hip replacement), 15+ MRIs, MS diagnosis (later retracted), 2 different autoimmune diagnose (also retracted), more steroid shots and nerve blocks than I can count on both hands and toes, and an unsuccessful 10 day stay at the Mayo Clinic. 

With every surgery I get worse and I am done trying to fix something structural that cannot be identified or managed by any of the 100 specialists I have seen. 

I have a 4 year and a 2 year old and I am now in my 4th year of misery. I work full time, but I cannot sit because it creates agonizing pain. I can’t exercise or do PT without putting myself in a spot where I can’t walk. Muscle spasms, burning hands, feet, joint pain, the works. This is ruining my life, straining my marriage, and I feel hopeless. It takes everything I have to get through each day. 

I am on pain meds and many other meds but they don’t help. My pain is not close to being “managed.”  My symptoms are very odd. They come and go, move around, worsen with stress, feel better when socializing, and candidly make no sense. I’ve been told I have multiple structural issues but none are “bad enough” to cause my pain. 

So, here we are. I am finally going to say f- it and try to lean into mind body work and see if maybe this can somehow help me. I know people in this sub aren’t a huge fan of this concept, and I really don’t want to elicit any negativity here. But, on the off chance there is somebody on here who has been successful with this approach, I could really use some encouragement that this might help. I just read Sarno’s book and am reading Alan Gordon’s book now. I also just signed up for a 20 hour workshop over the next 10 weeks at a local place that teaches reprocessing therapy. If you’ve had success please let me know. 

If you don’t believe in it or think it’s bullshit; that’s valid but please don’t use this as an opportunity to make me feel even more hopeless. I follow this sub a lot and I know there are a lot of great people in here who are struggling and I think of you all often. Thanks for the camaraderie over the years; it’s been really helpful for me to have an online place to vent and know I’m not alone. ",1767755230.0,19,20,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1q630ap,Medical Mystery: unexplained chronic pelvic pain that has kept me bedridden for 7 months….would appreciate any insight please.,"Seven months ago, I suddenly developed severe, debilitating pelvic pain out of nowhere. A week later, I went to the ER and was told an ovarian cyst had ruptured on my right side (where the pain started). I was told the pain would resolve, but it never did.

The pain soon moved to both sides and is constant and severe enough that I’m essentially bedridden 24/7. Any movement (walking, sitting, bending, twisting) makes it significantly worse. It’s not related to food, time of day, or my menstrual cycle. Multiple doctors have said the pain is located exactly where my ovaries are.

Before this, I was healthy. I’ve since seen over a dozen specialists and had extensive testing, including invasive procedures, but I keep being told “everything looks normal.” The lack of answers has been incredibly frustrating. 

I’m posting in hopes that someone has experienced something similar or that a medical professional might suggest a direction I haven’t explored. I’ve included a list of specialists and tests for reference. I have even gotten second opinions in some cases. 

This has been devastating for my family. I have two little ones who’ve had to watch their mother lose nearly all physical ability, and the emotional and financial strain has been overwhelming.

1q5vykm,"I'm finally cured, more or less :)","I wanted to share my story to bring you some hope!

I injured my supraspinatus muscles more than 2 years ago while kayaking.
At first they were just sore and I didn't think much of it, I kept telling myself ""it'll be fine, just a couple days and it will pass"" but the pain didn't go away, it just kept getting worse.
It only hurt when I was resting, not when I moved my shoulders, it made sleeping not ideal at first but eventually it got almost impossible to get a normal night of sleep.

At a certain point I realised that it wasn't going to go away on its own so I tried going to a physical therapist and he told me ultrasound therapy would've healed me, I fell for it. Obviously it didn't do anything and the pain just kept getting worse worse.

One day it got so bad that it felt like burning and someone stabbing my shoulder from inside, I could barely sleep more than 4 hours a night, and the huge amount of stress started a chronic gastritis in my stomach. That's when I reached my lowest, I tried opioid painkillers to try and alleviate it, but they didn't work, I even tried seeing an osteopath, he just made my pain even worse (osteopaths are just a bunch of pseudoscientific hocus pocus scammers and I don't want to have anything to do with them ever again).

I got very depressed, I stopped going to university because I was so tired and could not make myself do anything more than the bare minimum to survive. 

I even thought about taking my own life to make the pain stop.
But I kept pushing.

Eventually I gave another try to physical therapy and went to a different therapist who prescribed me exercises for my shoulders such as lateral rises, pushups, military press and more. 

My shoulder muscles started to get stronger and stronger and very slowly but steadily, the pain started to go away, little by little.

I also started swimming and it gave my shoulders a huge boost.

Now it's been a year and a half since I started this new physical therapy and I've gotta say: my shoulders never hurt this little since everything started. I can finally sleep 8 hours without any issue, they only hurt sometimes when I lay in weird positions, but most of the time they are just ""normal"" for a lack of a better word.

I'm so happy that I managed to beat this horrible pain and now I can finally say: I'm no longer suffering from chronic pain, and I couldn't be happier.

What’s the point of going to appointments twice a week just to do these excercises excercises??? Like to me it seems kind of pointless to do that when they already have me the excercises to do at home and to come in twice a week. Like that’s just WAY too much money for me to be spending. Is it so they get more money?? To me it seems like they just want my money. I can’t pay $130 a week for 12 weeks. Like that’s just ridiculous! I don’t know what to do. Should I just tell them at my next appointment that I can only do it once a week?

1q5ls0y,Doctor disappeared,"Hello, 
Just have to vent. 
I finally found a great PCP who helped on many issues and I was supposed to see him in December for blood work and to get a referral for an orthopedic surgeon to consult for a 2nd surgery. I was really looking forward to this referral and it was going to help with this pain. I last saw him in September. Early December, I call to make an appointment and get the blood work form and the line is disco. I email, it bounces back as undeliverable. I go to the website, classic 404 error, site not found. Everything online says he's open and taking new patients. I drive to his office. Closed and cleaned out. Facebook and Instagram all look normal. I message there, nothing and to message on LinkedIn- I need a premium account. I already put in a complaint with the nurses board. I'm upset,  because it went from a referral that can help with pain to literally starting at square 1 with finding a new PCP. I was also on TRT and some heart medications that you aren't supposed to just stop. Luckily, I had a 90 day refill left for the heart meds, the TRT, I just had to stop and go without.

I have had so many problems and suspect the hardware and screws are causing most of them. This recent one started happening a couple months after fusion but would go away on its own. I am going on 4 days of this excruciating pain making me yell when taking a step. Since surgery I have not been able to sleep on my back at all and one side causes nerve pain and the other side is starting to cause nerve pain and aching deep inside and now this pain is back. I am miserable and seems like I am getting worse. From what I read it seems to be femoral nerve compression. I am seeing a 3rd nuerosurgeon soon for an opinion. The second nuerosurgeon I saw would not give me any info as to what is going on just wanted me to get a spinal stimulator for pain. I cannot live like this and thinking that I need the hardware taken out but was not fully fused in June of this year. ,1767711487.0,2,3,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1q5kfny,Advil and Tylenol never helped for chronic shoulder pain after an injury.  GP tells me: 'That's why the diagnosis chronic pain is applicable for you'. Que?,"Hi all,

I'm experiencing a low point in treating a chronic sports injury of my shoulder. 34 yo male. 

It happened 3,5 years ago, in the gym. Acutely felt something pop accompanied with pain. 

I've been sent from pillar to post trying to get a diagnosis and treatment. 

2 Years of shoulder rehab at PT.   
2 MRI's with contrast ( 3 years apart; the last one showed 'ALL GOOD').  
Consulted 3 different specialist who all had a different opinion.

Now my GP told me last week, since Advil and Tylenol don't help (never helped me), this is a 'clear indicator I'm experiencing chronic pain'. 

I don't know what the hell to think of this. 

If I'm doing the PT, my shoulder nags for 3 to 4 days. If I'm using my shoulder actively same story. If I'm being the most lazy couch potato ever, no PT, no using my shoulder, I'm GOOD. 

Can't live like that tho, and being a couch potato wrecks my body anyway, losing muscle and becoming stiff. 

So is this chronic pain? Should Advil and Tylenol work in any case? Feel so lost man. ",1767710605.0,2,3,ChronicPain,mental_physical

I need to try and go back to bed for a little due to medical appts and PT tomorrow but ill check my OP later as idk if it went screwy with autocorrect, voice to text, or I was hust halfway between passing out for pure physical/mental exhaustion after 4.5 days on less than 4 hrs total sleep. There is definitely a bunch of extra text that doesn't make sense and wasn't supposed to be there I just can't read through it right now and filter that shit out but I'll try to later. The info medication & patch & RX timing are all legitimate but there seems to be random tezt i need to remove to make the post as clear and concise as possible. 

So when I was first prescribed that Fentanyl patches it was still the gel type and those would literally peeled off my skin either cuz of sweat or attaching to fabric or just for the fuck of it sometimes it would be 48 Hours sometimes it would be 36 hours sometimes it'll be fucking 20 minutes later. Now that definitely improved with the films and most of the time I can get 48 hours out of them before they start peeling off randomly but my condition also has very strange skin issues and I also have skin issues and also sweat abnormally much sometimes but everyone always says to use the overlays of the second term. Well for the first few years I kept trying to use it and even when I was in the hospital and they put them on because of how my skin is the patch will come off from the skin and attached to the decaderm and then fold into itself. Now I know that sounds like bullshit and I'm making excuses to need patches sooner because obviously if they're not touching my skin they can't release the medication properly but I have had Insurance pictures to my doctors as evidence with the patches and overlays on where you can see actual bubbles between my skin or even the patch folding underneath itself at multiple Corners to the point that even 50% of the patch isn't touching but I figured I would at least just share this photo because I'm sure some of you might or might not think this is an issue that you're dealing with and not want to mention it to the doctors for fear of being you know look that as drug Seekers but this does happen and I found that the brand I use this doesn't normally happen with it's not psyched her it's an Amazon off the table brand and it's cold transparent film dressing by an NeuHeils.

They come a lot more in the much deeper than the target room and I think you'll be useful for people that might have issues with these sticking to their skin because at most it'll it's me once in the area once I'm about to take them off for a little bit of time and that's it no rashes no skin tearing none of the crazy shit that sometimes it's like with tegaderm.

 almost never separat3 and this is one of the first times I've actually ever seen it start to separate and because I noticed it and wanted to take a picture I made it slightly worse but I've had them even much worse than this picture shows even while in the hospital and unable to move and you know I mentioned it to the nurses and they acknowledged it was true so I'll figure this was at least something to help validate what some of you may be going through. 

This is actually one of the reasons why my doctor prescribes them every 48 hours because even though it my metabolism is also too high to let 72 hours be effective them falling off for them a month when you only get 10 patches was a major issue when I first started em. 

Besides that I've been stable at the stores for 12 years so I can't shit on that they obviously work[f patch folded into itself under tegaderm/overlay meant to prevent that.](https://imgur.com/a/EteMG52)",1767707348.0,1,8,ChronicPain,mental_physical

1q5f5e3,"After 2 years of severe asthma and Adrenal Insufficiency, my body is stuck in ""survival mode."" Looking for advice from those who have overcome somatic trauma.","I’m sharing my story in hopes of getting some guidance or perspective from anyone who has gone through something similar and managed to move forward.

**The Background** It started two years ago. I moved to a city I loved for an incredible job. Within a week, my lifelong asthma became severe and uncontrollable. After four months of extreme respiratory distress and a hospitalization (where I caught COVID and the flu on top of everything), I had to quit my job and leave the city. I was devastated; I stayed as long as I could because I didn’t want to go back to my mother’s house. During those months, I developed intense pain in my intercostal muscles and all my accessory respiratory muscles (neck, traps, ribs).

Surprisingly, once I moved back and my breathing stabilized, the pain and the sensation of shortness of breath (dyspnea) stayed.

**The Medical Crisis** On top of that, I developed **Corticosteroid-Induced Adrenal Insufficiency**. My body stopped producing cortisol. Some might think ""no cortisol = no stress,"" but it’s the opposite. Without cortisol, you can’t handle *any* stress. You feel like you’re going to faint, you have no strength, and even basic sensory input feels overwhelming. Two years later, I’m still recovering. I have enough cortisol for daily life, but not for stress (work, intense exercise, strong emotions, or illness).

**The Somatic Connection** For a long time, the shortness of breath drove me crazy. My tests are now excellent and my asthma is controlled, but my body still *acts* like it can’t breathe. I recently realized this is a muscular/nervous system issue, not a lung issue.

I’ve seen dozens of doctors and specialists. Early on, I lost 2kg a month until I hit 45kg. I was told I might have cancer, which destroyed my mental health. After a 3-week hospitalization, they finally found the Adrenal Insufficiency. However, regarding my chronic pain and dyspnea, most doctors treated me like a ""ghost""—they couldn't explain it and eventually dismissed it as psychological.

**What I’m Feeling Now** A respiratory physical therapist finally explained that my body is stuck: my diaphragm is constantly tight, my obliques hinder exhalation, and my neck muscles (scalenes) are always ""on."" It’s a somatic problem. My mind wants to go back to my old life, but my body is stuck in the trauma of those four months when I couldn't breathe.

**What I’ve Tried:**

* **Physical Therapy:** Myofascial release and Vagus Nerve induction work, but the relief only lasts a few hours.
* **Lifestyle:** Gym, yoga, and rehab. They help, but they don't ""cure"" the underlying tension.
* **Therapy:** I’m seeing a Gestalt therapist with experience in trauma. We work on ""body presence,"" but I haven't seen major changes yet.
* **Medication:** I’ve been on 5mg of Diazepam for two years (my psychiatrist sees it as a ""lesser evil"" for now). I’m considering SSRIs in the future.

**The Mental Struggle** I feel a huge conflict. I loved the city that ""destroyed"" my life. I feel stuck while everyone else moves on. I have this overwhelming craving to feel **safe** again—safe in my own body.

To make matters harder, I live with my mother who has Fibromyalgia. She is in constant pain, and hearing her daily struggle makes me terrified that I will end up like her, trapped in a cycle of chronic pain.

I’ve read *The Body Keeps the Score* and I’m looking into more resources on trauma and the nervous system.

**Has anyone here dealt with severe somatic symptoms after a medical crisis? How did you teach your nervous system that the danger is over?**

I would love to hear any success stories or advice. Thanks for reading.

**""Edit/Update:** I forgot to mention a detail that might be relevant. For about 4 years, I’ve had a urological issue (difficulty urinating). Because of this, I’ve developed a habit of tensing my pelvic floor, obliques, and diaphragm to compensate. I haven't fully investigated this with invasive tests due to medical anxiety, but I’m now realizing this 'pelvic bracing' might be acting as an anchor, preventing my diaphragm from relaxing and worsening my breathing mechanics.""",1767695696.0,2,16,ChronicPain,mental_physical

I get that there are a lot of deaths related to opioids, but per CDC, there are far more alcohol only related deaths than opioid only related deaths.

but if you mention that there is some amount of hysteria over opioids, medical professionals will look at you like you’re crazy

It is indeed a wacky wacky world in which we live…

Edit: I added the following to a subsequent comment, but I think it fits here:

Edit: I would \[also\] add that opioid overdoses are highly correlated with stressors from socioeconomic status, not prescriptions. For example you find opioid overdoses are correlated with poverty, unemployment, and so on.

None of the prohibitionist moralizer’s ever want to discuss that aspect.

It’s almost as if the non-poor/non-disenfranchised \*need\* to have it be a prescription problem. I mean, FFS, if we acknowledged that if it were poverty rather than pain prescriptions that caused overdose deaths, then we might feel like we’re obligated to fix poverty rather than some imaginary problem…

1q5ds15,"Worked up the courage to see a new doctor, and was told there’s no point coming to the doctor for chronic pain and I just need to push though it","I’ve been experiencing debilitating pain for 10 years (since I was 14) I’ve been going to doctors and different specialists for years and so far either treatment is too expensive, not appropriate for my issues, or just not provided, I’ve tried different meds, I go to physio weekly and stay as consistent as possible with my physio exercise, I mediate twice daily, I do qi gong, Feldenkrais, OT, therapy, I walk in nature as much as I can, I swim, I just lie on the earth and focus of feeling grounded, I eat a very healthy diet, I try to distract myself from my pain, I do everything they always tell you to do, and yet over and over I hear the same “just keep doing what your doing” until when? Until I die?

I decided to try seeing a new GP to just see if she had a different perspective, I didn’t go in there just asking for opiates, I explained how I’ve been struggling with pain for a long time despite taking all the usual measures to try to help, I don’t work, I don’t study, I barely have a life outside of trying to be okay, and sometimes the pain is so bad that I’m bed bound and unable to care for myself, she asked me what I wanted and I said “if there is a treatment that I can afford, some sort of procedure that will fix the issue with my back, I would want that, if there’s nothing else I can do, I just want to have my flare pain managed so I can have a better quality of life”.

She then proceeded to go on an “opiate bad” tirade, everything I’ve already heard but even more, I tried to question her on her logic, regarding dependence and needing to increase doses, withdrawal, and symptoms coming back worse after you stop, I said “most prescriptions have risks, dependence, needing to increase the dose, and symptoms getting worse once stopping eg, SSRIs SNRIs, gabapentin and pregabalin”, she said they were still different.

I explained that when the pain is severe, I get pushed to almost ending my own life because it feels like I’m being tortured, I explained how my previous doctors just handed me a help line for the lifeline, and that I don’t believe that’s a helpfull response to that, she said that pain can’t make you kill yourself, and that you mentally just need to find a way to cope with the pain, and that it’s something no one can help me with but myself”, I told her that was cruel, and that they wouldn’t say that about any other condition but chronic pain.

I then asked her “so what can I even do? I just want to live a normal life, I want to be healthy, functional, active and self reliant” and she replied with “doctors will not be able to help your chronic pain, you will need to find a solution within yourself to accept the pain, keep doing what your doing”

I asked her how I’m supposed to keep going like this, and she said that’s for me to figure out

I’ve probably missed a few things because about 5 minutes into the appointment I started crying uncontrollably, I feel at a complete loss, I have absolutely no faith in the medical system anymore, they don’t care if people kill them selves as long as it doesn’t come back on them, I cried violently for over an hour and a half after this appointment, I don’t even know if I’ve ever cried like that before, the lack of care and empathy from these people shocks me more and more every time, I just wanted to vent because today has been so overwhelming :(

Guys what can we do? I know a lot of you have similar experiences? How can we make life liveable?

1q5cwp9,What madness is this??? A Rant.,"I'm in a different state this month, taking care  of my 83 year old dad. He  is having knee replacement surgery.

It is a huge challenge being in chronic pain and *also* taking on the caregiver role. It is complicated by the fact that I have to sleep in a strange bed in a house where my needs are not understood. Or supported. And where I have to deal with totally f**ked up family patterns, one of which is a total disregard for the need to *plan* so that I have less energy expenditure and things don't go wrong that could have been foreseen! And honestly, their crisis is not my crisis.

But it pisses me off.

What I didn't anticipate was the idiocy of the people who are supposed to be *helping* dad (the medical people).

So they decided he needed a blood thinner, post op. It has to be injected. They gave him 12 pre-loaded syringes. These are not pens. They are capped syringes.

They did not show him how to inject himself.

They did not provide a sharps container so that he could legally and safely dispose the sharps.

I called the pharmacy. Naturally it is CVS Pharmacy, also known as Careless, Vile, Slackers. I can't figure out why they don't negligently *kill* more people! She told me to  put the sharps in an old plastic milk jug (which we don't have), tape it up, and *throw it in the garbage*.

In the garbage. They are f**king needles.

Dad also had a prescription for a long acting AND short term Oxycodone for pain. They only filled the short acting, but oh they made him pay for a bunch of *Naloxone* in case he ODs while taking his pain meds as prescribed! (There is no concern he will get  confused because one of the reasons *I* am here is *give him his meds safely*!)

Then they give him these totally bat-shit *insane* directions to taper off his meds. 1. After 5 days, he is supposed to stop taking Oxycodone at night. Nevermind he's having *knee replacement*. 
2. Then after another 5 days, completely discontinue *all* Oxycodone. 
3. THEN, once he is off all Oxy, at the 2 week mark, start tapering by increasing the length of time between pills or cutting in half his Oxys (even though he won't be taking them, because according to their directions, he will have discontinued them!) 
4. And never fear, even though he won't be taking them, he can have *a refill*!

These directions are completely insane. They are *literally gibberish*. Nonsense.

Dad has helped. He has created a crisis for himself because he has not purchased anything they told him to get. He'll have a walker leaving the hospital. He did not get an ice machine, a plastic sleeve for bathing, a rack to help him get off the toilet, or a shower seat. I cannot drive all over looking for these things because I cannot leave him (and because the one thing I am not doing is running all over the city after his surgery. I can't. I am disabled and immunocompromised).

This is a total circus. And they are not my monkeys. My family and the doctors have made it impossible to support him. ",1767687298.0,20,43,ChronicPain,mental_physical

1q53260,Nervous-system-maintained guarding pattern with walking as the only thing seeming to very slowly help reverse things,"Hi everyone,  
I’m hoping to hear from people who might have experienced something similar.

For about 10+ years I’ve had chronic muscle tightness and guarding mostly on the right side of my body (hip, TFL, glute, diaphragm, pelvic floor, cremaster, lower back, but even upper back and shoulder). Probably the core root being in my lumbar area, which feels totally frozen. There was no injury. It started gradually after a long period of very narrow overuse at the gym (basically hammering the same muscles to failure for a long time). Over the years it turned into a whole right-sided pattern, and many areas felt almost “disconnected” — tight but with very little sensation.

Strengthening, stretching, breathing work, and pelvic floor exercises actually made things worse, so I stopped all targeted exercise. About 6–7 months ago I started doing only daily walking (1–2 long walks a day) and nothing else.

The changes have been extremely slow, but recently I’ve noticed subtle shifts: areas that felt dead for years are starting to have sensation again, like intermittent aching, itching, tingling, or brief pins and needles, especially after walking or when lying down. My right glute, which used to be completely bypassed, now seems to activate more automatically during walking. There’s still very little actual relief, especially in the right hip and lower back, but the quality of sensation is definitely different than it was for years.

Progress feels very non-linear — some days feel hopeful, others feel completely stuck — and that’s honestly hard mentally. From what I understand this might be more of a **nervous-system-maintained guarding pattern** rather than a structural injury, and **walking seems to be the only thing my body tolerates,** as I tried TRE, diaphragm breathing, meditation before with no results.

I’m not looking for quick fixes. I’d just really appreciate hearing from anyone who’s had long-standing unilateral tension like this and eventually improved, even if it took a long time. Just knowing I’m not alone would help as this is just hell and hard to describe fully.

1q51x5p,weird pain RANT,"sorry guys i just need to get this out of my system. 

for the past six months i have been experiencing the weirdest pain ever and it’s driving my INSANE. 

it aches in my entire body but it’s a kind of pain i’ve never experienced (although im only 21 so i suppose i haven’t experienced too much haha). the pain is so diffuse i can’t pin point where the pain starts and stops. it’s not the kind of pain that’s like “ow it hurts when i move my pick up my glass” or something. it makes it so difficult to describe the pain to my doctor. it’s not tingling or numbness like nerve pain. but it’s not muscle soreness or joint aches either. it’s not shooting or sharp or cramping or burning. no word seems to fit! 

the pain is seemingly everywhere and nowhere and it makes me just want to cry all the time. its like my body is just full of static. i feel like i’m going crazy! 

and of course, in prime american healthcare fashion, my PCP sent me to rheumatology who sent me to neurology who sent me to PCP. just chasing my tail, running test after test and receiving normal result after normal result. 

i’m tired. i’m pissed at how much of my life this has stolen from me. im devastated at how much it will steal from me in the future. im sad that i look back at 2025 as the year that changed everything. and im grieving for myself and all the other young girls that can’t find answers and HURT every day while doctors shrug and take their every dwindling money.

1q4yoyp,Do I need a cane/should I get one?,"I have chronic pain, hyper mobility, lymphedema, possibly asthma (idk i just suck at breathing), I tend to get dizzy when I stand up, and my body just hurts all the damn time. I’m a teenager (gonna be 18 soonish) and I’ve struggled with all this nonsense and other physical and mental issues for a while. Recently my pain has gotten worse and I thought about purchasing a cane. This would be mostly to take weight off of the lower half of my body, help me stand up, and help my back when standing up. 

I’m unsure if I should get one though. As in do I actually need one and I think I would be embarrassed to use it. Especially in the place I would need it most which is at school. I do not have enough time to put all of my stuff in my moldy ass locker so I carry everything except a textbook in my book bag. It is fucking grueling. That thing is probably 30 pounds. 

When I was looking at some cane options today my mother mentioned that we should talk to my doctor(s) about getting a cane before I do so. She said that getting a cane may affect my spine/ worried how it would affect me (don’t know if I’m using the right affect/effect). I agree with her but my logic is that if you get a properly sized cane it won’t mess with your spine and also the sooner I get this the better. 

I guess I’m just having a big conflict on whether or not to get the cane. I feel like I’m trying to make up reason why to get it and why not to. I would love y’all’s advice and opinions.

EDIT:

It seems I’m getting a post mortem of my character whilst I’m still around. Yes, my post history shows I’ve used recreationally which of course is wrong; but given I’m a \[trying\] student in my early 20s who occasionally intoxicated themselves on their meds or other substances is it much of a surprise? Have you never done this at all while young and dumb?

If you haven’t slept rough whilst this ill, been running their entire lives from every form of child abuse, then miraculously got a scholarship and was thrown into a massive culture shock and needed an escape you can’t know what it was for me, just as I wouldn’t know what it is for you or how perceptions of addicts in the media has affected us all. That’s why you’d see the posts about E, recreational pregab, and NOS. If I were the addict to my pain meds you think I am they would have lost working a long long time ago, and this post wouldn’t be placed today because I wouldn’t be around.

The more recent ones on drug forums - literally state and show I was looking for how to best increase the efficacy of my meds through altering the ROA. I haven’t gone beyond dosage (when accounting for the total MME), lied that I’ve lost them to get more, stolen or cheated. But pain has driven me to self destruction- it’s the only thing I can pride myself on. I haven’t destroyed others. Just today on the ward nurses informally confiscated my shaving equipment since they heard the pain doc say there was no solution and saw me sob and seize uncontrollably.

If you don’t see that the point of this post is that a literal doctor said to me that euthanasia is a viable option despite being 23 then nothing I can say will illustrate that.

I’m not attempting to excuse myself by playing the oppression olympics, but I am here answering those of you who’d think I wouldn’t last a day in your shoes and affirming that I wouldn’t dare excercise a post mortem on your character if you were alive or not.

With all the languages and all the dictionaries of the world we cannot still find a way to articulate the nature of our suffering to one another - hence the existence of these words we string together just clinging to the notion that maybe one day some one would understand us.",1767620040.0,61,49,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1q4ips6,question about exercise !,"hi!! i’m not sure if this is a great place to ask this, but i’ve had a consistent issue and now that i think more about it…it feels very backwards? i totally plan on doing more research then asking one of my providers about this later, i just wanted some additional input and i was curious if this was a common occurrence.

i have a few chronic conditions—including but not limited to amps, slipping rib syndrome, degenerative disc disease, chronic migraines, intercostal neuralgia & generalized hypermobility. (just naming things likely to be the culprit here.)

onto my main point! when i’m in physical therapy doing small simple exercises for strengthening, i experience an immediate rise in pain. that’s expected, and we do what we can to reduce the amount of pain i’m in.

but outside of that, i can do larger amounts of movement/exercise for significantly longer with less of an immediate rise. for example, 50 jumping jacks is less immediately painful than doing one bridge. 

instead, anywhere from 6-18 hours later, i get hit with an extremely intense bout of fatigue. i can’t move or focus, most of the time i can’t sleep despite being extremely tired, almost cold like symptoms?, and my other normal symptoms flare significantly. it doesn’t feel like muscle soreness or anything like that, i worked out way more before getting sick. i know what post excertional muscle soreness feels like.

i’m mainly just confused on why it doesn’t hit immediately even if i’m doing way more in the moment? if i sound like an idiot, sorry 😭. it just doesn’t make sense and i’m worried it’s something i’m doing wrong.",1767610563.0,2,2,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1q4hnsx,2 years of back pain. Extreme muscle guarding - any suggestions?,"Hey

I've been dealing with back pain for 2 years now. It's largely ruined my life and has stopped me doing the things I love. I managed to overcome the disc herniation - and returned to sports recently. However now I've developed facet joint pain. 

My physio said that I've got a lot of muscle guarding in the area. This can make facet joints worse by compressing them. The thing is I don't know how to beat this muscle guarding.

My emotions are so tied up with this injury. I have so much fear - as when you google facet joint pain / syndrome - the general consensus is that it's permanant and degenerative. This triggers my fear and probably increases my pain and makes recovery less likely.

I've got a tens machine. I'm doing physio & accupuncture & getting massage. I'm meditating and journalling. I'm taking baths. But I'm still terrified. It's the first thing I think of when I wake up and last thing before I go to sleep.

1q4ezu9,How I balance my inflammation,"I deleted my post I made earlier because I didn't like the title. We all have pain issues and is generally caused by inflammation of one type or another. Whether it's flare-ups from Auto inflammatory disorders or just inflammation from moving a weary joint. 
 I used ibuprofen heavily for a number of years until my gut just didn't take it anymore. My doctor convinced me to try Celebrex cuz that has the best track record for possibly not having gastro effects, it works great but 3 weeks in my gut went bloated. 
So now I use a variety of things I use turmeric, collagen, cherry,THC tinctures and edibles, CBD sometimes. 
When I have too, I use prednisone because that knocks inflammation out and gives me a sort of reset. 
Otherwise, I think hydration, electrolyte balance, and keeping up with your vitamins and minerals is a good way to keep your body on point as much as possible.  
The way I look at it, I'm already in my 50s,  how much longer do I really have left. 20 years?  I was diagnosed with severe degenerative disorder 5 years ago. My kidney and liver enzymes are great because ultimately I haven't been using steroids and opioids and such all my life.

1q49aom,Long Term Bupe and chronic pain.,"Hi all — longtime member/lurker here. I try to give back more than I ask, but I’m hoping for some lived-experience input.

Quick background: I live with chronic pain and have stayed functional for many years with good medical care. I’ve tapered down to a low dose of tramadol, but I still get breakthrough pain, with a suspected fibro/nervous-system component. Occasionally I wake very early with severe, non-specific pain (joints/muscles cramping, skin burning/freezing). I’ve been pretty plateaued for a while.
My doctor suggested considering buprenorphine instead of tramadol, partly to avoid tramadol’s SNRI/SSRI effects and partly for steadier baseline coverage. It’s made me think this may be a long-term condition that needs consistent treatment rather than constant adjustment.
My main concerns are function, efficacy, and stigma. I know there’s a big difference in how pain-indicated buprenorphine (Butrans/Belbuca) vs the “sub-” meds are perceived.

Not looking for medical advice — just experiences.
Has anyone here used buprenorphine for chronic pain, especially after tramadol? Did it help with stability or function?

1q487sa,Not supposed to use a cane,"I have a dilemma I could use some help with.

After a diagnosis of AMPS, I was told not to use a cane, as it would impair my healing and “remind my brain that I am in pain.” Previously, I had used it as sparingly as possible and only to get around school or increase the amount of time I can spend outside. (When I walk, my legs hurt a lot, and it takes some of the pressure off.)

For several months, I’ve been doing my best without it, but I don’t understand the idea that something that was helping is reminding me of pain (when the pain itself is reminding me lol). It’s only made my life more difficult to navigate.

It’s been really difficult without it. I also am extremely fatigued all the time, so I already can’t complete many tasks without meds. I’m constantly in pain, and without a cane, I can’t spend as much time outside/active or with my friends because my ability to function is basically halved.

To sum up my situation, I’ve been told that rigorous exercise is the solution (despite physical therapy having made me worse), and unfortunately, I don’t have the energy to spend more than a few hours out of bed every day. I hate not being able to use a cane.

1q47zxj,Just a lil moment of hope,"I have a multitude of issues with my neck. Loose ligaments, instability, slight chiari malformation, cervical kyphosis, whiplash injury, and bulging discs.

So it always hurts. If it’s not one thing, it’s another. 

For the past 2 and a half years I haven’t been able to lift anything more than 5-8lbs without a resulting migraine, brain fog, or nerve pain that borderline disabled me for a week or two afterwards. Even super minimal body weight exercises (designed for elderly and simplified even further for me) resulted in weeks of pain. 

Slowly but surely recently — and I can’t really pinpoint why— I’ve felt my neck getting stronger. Very slightly, barely noticeable, but noteworthy for me. 

So yesterday, I woke up with neck pain.

Typical. It wasn’t any of my pain I’m used to, but it felt familiar for some reason. I puzzled over it because my head was completely fine. No migraine, brain fog, or nerve pain. 

And then I had what felt like the stupidest epiphany ever: the pain in my neck was because my *neck muscles* were *sore.* *Sore muscles.* Like, from *exercise.*

I’ve been watching my 8mo nephew pretty frequently, and on Friday he was nutso. I picked him up, put him down, lifted him up, repeatedly over like 9 hours. And it must have exercised my neck. 

SO not only did I lift enough, repeatedly, to exercise my neck and result in sore muscles (a HUGE deal in itself because I haven’t been able to do *anything* to strengthen my neck for years), but on top of that my head is completely fine. No migraines, brain fog, nerve pain, no having to ice or take excedrin or lie down for days on end. 

I know it’s just sore muscles and might not sound like a big deal, but it’s a sign that my neck is getting stronger. That is SUPER exciting. Like, maybe I’ll be able to exercise again. Or take out the trash or bring in the groceries and be okay. Or rock my nephew to sleep without suffering the consequences for days afterwards. 

That’s all. I can feel my neck getting stronger after years of disability and unuse and it’ll still be a journey, no doubt — but it’s a hopeful moment for me that I wanted to share. ❤️",1767576422.0,21,3,ChronicPain,mental_physical

1q43jmu,Struggle to enjoy any good time I have,"Just sum it up.

When I got sick all I asked my friends for is to send me something cool, interesting, shitty or depressing. Doesn’t matter just anything to let me know what’s going on in the outside world I’m not involved with anymore.

I would send memes, tv shows I thight they’d like, some new food or something i tried.

Broaden eachother knowledge and horizons.

Even if you’re not super depressed getting a text form someone sharing something always helps unless they  are just needy asking for things.

But this was sharing. Only years later did I get to the point of alright ima share some depressing shit cause I have no one anymore

But I would say it to others that were struggling first. Like hey bro let’s lift eachother up here and help in our crisis.

We’ll be able to be healthier and improve ourselves better that way anyway

None of them kept it up for more than a month and it was mostly them sharing how they didn’t get their Starbucks and the extra 5 minutes of traffic ruined their day

So then it was like so wait I’m disabled and I can’t bitch but no starvucks ruined your entire week?

Like hey some perspective here

I then tried super nice, distant, mean, happy, super intelligent, world wide events, fuck you ur selfish as fuck and nothing.

Not one single way ever got their attention until they did lose their job of gf and it was

“Omg bro can we go abck to sharing things and supporting eachother”

Cool. But then they’d go back to how they were when they got a new gf or whatver it was.

So overtime you just resent the hell out of these people and even if you forgive and forget ur gonna get the same outcome

I used to run a lot and that honestly was beyond mentally health. As long a I ran daily my pain and emotions were better.

I could sit and play a game, eating dinner and movie. Fill entertianment dopamine surge lol and be like “fuck them, fuck the world, this is enjoy Kyle time”

Even running again and better I can’t get to that point.

I end pacing with YouTube in the background thinking who I could connect with

I’m doing that now. I just want to play a game and watch my tv show happily and I can’t.

I feel claustrophobic and like I’m missing out in the world

So I guess I’m looking for people with real problems we all probably have that can do that for eachother.

Maybe we can share things and keep eachother company when we feel like that. No babysitting. Just like a message here and there about something you enjoyed

Or maybe a time frame where’s it like we know we are all chilling doing the same thing.

Feel less alone and actually enjoy the activity at hand

Message me, comment , doesn’t matter. This sub and world is full of lonely people and I got no problem making the first move to contact.

Just need others to actually follow through

Edit Side note, people can be into everything from god to anime. Can be 2 super nice people but have 0 In common so here’s some random things I shared

1. If watched almost every move and show I wanted so theirs not much left. Really wanted some type of adventure see different scenery type show. I found the 2024 tv show remake of the count of monte Cristo.

Fit that very well for me. For that feeling Wanted things Troy, master and commander, lord of the rings, ya know something with huge open worlds.

2. There’s a new huawei factory that was build to look like authentic European cities from the renaissance. They have rivers, canals and everything built for full authenticity.

I guess that style is perfect for Motivation and creativity.

3. Want to play cyperpunk or red dead 2 and really get lost in a world. But because of what I described I can relax or enjoy that.

Current situation:

	Age: 62, overweight

	Severe knee pain - can barely walk without limping

	Baker’s cyst that keeps filling up, causing swelling

MRI diagnosis shows:

       Medullary edema

	Prepatellar infrapattellar muscle edema

	Chronic chondromalacia grade II-III (lateral)
	
        Polyarticular degenerative changes with effusion
	 Lateral meniscus tear
	 
        Baker’s cyst with inflammation
The problem:

The pain is so bad she can barely walk normally. The knee keeps swelling up from the cyst. Conservative treatment hasn’t helped much so far.

My questions:

	1.	Has anyone dealt with similar severity and found relief WITHOUT surgery?

	2.	What treatments actually worked for you - PT, injections, weight loss?

	3.	At 62, is meniscus repair still possible, or would they just remove it?

	4.	If the meniscus is removed - does this mean the joint will deteriorate within a few years and eventually need knee replacement?

	5.	Any advice on managing the Baker’s cyst?

I know weight loss would help tremendously, but right now she’s in too much pain to exercise.
I’m really worried that surgery might just be a stepping stone to knee replacement down the line. But I also can’t stand watching her in this much pain every day.

Follow-up cervical MRIs have been reviewed by multiple specialists and I’ve been told the implant looks stable, with no obvious cervical explanation for the symptoms.

Lately, I’ve been wondering whether thoracic spine or thoracic nerve involvement could play a role, since I’ve read that thoracic issues can sometimes refer pain to the interscapular area.

I’m curious whether anyone here with thoracic disc bulges, thoracic radiculopathy, or similar issues has experienced:

1q3dovc,Can the medical system and doctors STOP pushing chronic patients to psychiatrists.," (I want to make it clear that I support the idea that psychiatrists and medical specialists should coexist and work side by side)

What I am tired of is doctors refusing to take context into account. When a patient has a chronic illness that causes constant pain, and that pain has destroyed their quality of life, doctors need to acknowledge that reality. If someone can no longer work, is facing financial instability, and lives in a country where pain management is heavily restricted, referring them to psychiatry after they clearly explain debilitating physical pain is fucked up. At that point, it is not even a mental health issue. The patient is asking for opioids to manage the pain but they will only be seen as drug seeking. 

For context, I already have both a psychiatrist and a therapist. I am medicated and have tried nearly every class of psychiatric medication. None of them have made me less depressed, and the reason is simple: I am in pain twenty four hours a day. Being disabled and in constant pain is not something you can think your way out of. Expecting someone with an able body to tell a disabled person to “manage” or “find a way to be okay” shows a complete lack of understanding. I cannot work, and disability payments keep people at a poverty level. Therapy does not fix physical suffering. At best, it becomes a place to vent.

When I spoke to my psychiatrist about MAID, they reacted as if the idea itself was shocking. I was told I am too young to even consider it, and the conversation immediately shifted to the standard questions about whether I am a danger to myself or others. That response completely missed the point. These doctors do not seem to understand the situation. They know my condition is chronic. They know it is incurable. They know that opioids are often the only effective way to manage this level of pain, yet access is denied. Instead, the suffering is reframed as a mental illness, as if the desire to escape unbearable pain is a personal failure or a lack of effort. It is treated as though we are to blame for not making progress, rather than acknowledging that the problem is unrelenting physical pain. Am I really crazy for preferring death over this hell? 

Despite all of this being clearly documented in my chart, doctors continue to refer me to psychiatry. They ignore the fact that I am already under psychiatric care. When I say that the pain is destroying me, that does not mean I need to be sent to a psychiatric ward. It means I need real medical help. Instead, I feel trapped in a loop. The same conversations happen over and over, nothing changes, and I am losing faith in seeing specialists at all.

I’m not saying posture is the cause of chronic pain, but for some people it seems to be one piece of a bigger puzzle.

I just need to vent a little, maybe get some advice or commiseration if folks have delt with similar. my mom is a *#WillpowerQueen* and just does not seem able to understand chronic illness... despite her own growing collection. my whole life I've been ""lazy and unambitious"", a ""whiner""... who's now, as an adult received ADHD and Elhers Danlose diagnoses, just today curvature of the spine because my shoulder bones are lopsided. I'd like to be able to talk with her about my life and struggles, but it inevitably leads to a fight. For example, standing up/sitting ""normally"" has always been painful for me - I've had two doctors pull the ""then don't do that"" line. I tell her this today and she still *insists* I ""straighten up, I was pidgeon-toed as a kid and I used my WILLPOWER to fix it!"" I snapped back that no amount of willpower would make my bones the right size, she went cold and told me to leave. She blames my dad for the bad genes and herself for having a kid with him, this is not speculation - she's told me to my face.


Part of me knows it must be tough! Hearing your kid is in chronic pain, always has been and always will be. It hard for her to know that there are things I won't be able to do. I even get feeling responsible for genetic conditions even if that's not how it works... but I don't think it's fair to be laying explicit blame. I don't think it's fair go on about the things its ""toooo bad"" I'll never experience to gotcha me into saying it's not that serious. I certainly don't think it's fair to tell my dad and his siblings she regrets getting together. 


My dad says just not to tell her, and I shouldn't... but fuck y'know it's my *mom*. I grew up hearing over and over that she was always gonna be there to listen. Kinda sucks when you do something instinctually and keep getting burned.

I’m 38 years old and have been dealing with chronic neck pain for almost 15 years after a whiplash injury and concussion.

This was not my fault, between the Dr. being out of the office, and my refill day landing in a day my pharmacy was not open, there was not another option. Two things I learned from this...1) Don't stop Gabapentin abruptly. 💯 percent do not recommend....2). Do not use CVS ever.
 I read that this does happen, but there is a way to recover a deleted prescription. They did nothing to help me. They didn't want to call the Dr. or do anything  to attempt to explain why my prescription was deleted. I have a feeling, they saw that I was also prescribed hydrocodone,  and took it upon themselves to decide that they didn't want to fill a non-controlled medication.( In Texas, Gabapentin is not controlled). Did I die? No, but it was just so annoying. I know everyone's opinion on Gabapentin, but that is not what this post is about. I will never use CVS again.

With the lack of care I developed kyphosis, weakness in all my muscles, and pain in my collarbones if I try to move my arms.

This is the “fun part”… I was fully conscious and aware during every single bit of my experience. My femurs were snapped in half/ poking out.. but I never went into shock or anything. I was just screaming the entire time and could feel absolutely everything. They had loaded me up with fentanyl, ketamine, etc you name it. Nothing worked.. all it did was calm me down a bit. After I was air lifted and brought in (the ride getting off the helicopter was absolutely one of the worst moments of my life no joke).. they had set my legs and put weights on my ankles. At that point idk what they gave me but I still felt everything and was just in paralysis… my breaths were down to 3 per minute.

After that pain management was so difficult and I remember staff not knowing what to do for me. Keep in mind I’m not a drug user so it’s not like I have experience to build a tolerance. Ever since then I’ve been so curious why my body was so unaffected by the drugs. At the time I could feel my body fighting on my behalf if that makes sense so idk.

1q2m8n0,My friend is in pain and I can't help her,"A friend of mine, who I love like a sister, has a myriad of conditions that make her life a living hell. (Her own words.) I won't explain all of them because many of them are very personal, but as of right now she's recovering from a major reconstructive hip surgery and she's in the worst constant pain she's ever been in. On top of that she has no local friends, and her partner just dumped her. Right in the middle of recovering from one of her most traumatic surgeries. (Of which she has had a few surgeries already, and every time friends fail her or pain management doesn't help her.) 

I used to be the one to drive her to appointments and I would spend time with her in person, but I had to leave the country for school, and now she feels completely alone. 

Sometimes she calls me crying because of how miserable things have gotten, and recently she just admitted to having serious suicidal ideation and having made some attempts. She feels like she can't go to the hospital because they always end up hurting her in the ER, and she feels like she can't go to any mental health services because they'll take her pain medications away. She is bed-bound, mostly from the pain but also from the depression and loneliness of having zero friends and now a partner who just up and left. 
Making friends is really difficult for her because of her condition, she oftentimes feels like people only hang out with her out of obligation, and I tried suggesting meeting people online or through a mutual Minecraft server but I think its hard to do that when she's so depressed and in so much pain. To really be friends quickly with someone online she would have to be vulnerable and open about what shes going through and shes not willing to do that with a new person, especially when able bodied people never understand the pain and the hurt she is constantly experiencing. 
She is a wonderful person who deserves accommodating friendships and support, and I just don't know what to do or what to tell her. I can't stand seeing her be treated so poorly by others, and I dont know what to tell her. All I can even muster is just telling her I love her and wish things were better for her, over and over again.

I don't ever want to take them again, and yet I still have occasional 10/10 pain days after two months. My nerves and muscles in my entire upper quadrant spasm endlessly. The nerves wrap around my collar bone and across the left half of my ribs, and my entire body is restless and entirely too wiggly. I'm crawling out of my skin. I'm having to take double the NSAIDs I'm supposed to, and that worries me. Sometimes my legs and arms are so heavy that I can't walk or get out of bed.
  
Every day it's better, though, even incrementally. Every day, I wake up at a more normal time and take a nap in the afternoon instead of sleeping until 4 pm. I'm less wiggly. I'm getting restorative and REM sleep for the first time in years. 
  
I have gone to so many specialists. I have done multiple sleep disorder tests, including the narcoleptic one. I was staying awake and working through the sheer power of prescribed ADHD meds alone, then dropping into bed and having vivid nightmares all night. 
  
The more I heal, the less nightmares I have. The less scary my nights become. The fog is clearing from my brain. 
  
I'm amazed that my ""sleep disorder"" turned out to be my impinged spinal cord. I'm astonished that this surgery is fixing things that have been problems for years. I have DDD from C3 down, but they only fused one.

Unfortunately the manager is the only person working tomorrow. She said people will be in line at 08:00 for the 09:30 opening. I can't stand more than 10 minutes and that's hellish pain. My legs will buckle; I'll be on the floor.

I'm in the middle of a bad flare that started yesterday. Considering the line and all day crowd tomorrow, I'm out of bed at the loan company. I can barely turn my head to drive. I'm sitting in a nice comfy chair waiting. I'm probably fifth in line.

I know the manager well and she is aware of my condition. Apparently it doesn't matter. They have no accommodations for the disabled.

The bottom line is I am here. It is totally frustrating I cannot make an appointment to be in and out. I know the manager cares. I know she has to abide by company policies. I'm not mad.

It's simply another brick in our societies' wall concerning how the disabled are treated. If I were able, standing in line, and long wait times wouldn't bother me.

That's my rant for the day. The positive is the chore will be done. I can go home, eat, and, back on bed rest. Payment will be made and anxiety will disappear.

I'm not complaining. I'm saying we, chronic pain patients, need to be treated better!",1767378441.0,1,1,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1q25wid,Update on: Pharmacy mistakes?,"I'm making a new post to update as it won't let me edit the original post?


Final update


I received a call back today, the pharmacy manager reached out to me and said not to take the broken pills, to bring them in when I pick up my next refill, and that the issue is on their end and that it's being taken care of. He couldn't give me any other information.


Update!:


I tried calling my pharmacy and a tech who I recognized the voice of answered and I greeted them by name and introduced myself and they went ""hey * I haven't seen you in a while, nice to hear from you!"" I told them I had an issue with my last Dilaudid prescription and needed to speak to the pharmacist, the tech said ""oh of course, * , * and * aren't here right now, we're actually working with a newer pharmacist, I'll get them for you, one sec."" so after a looonnngg hold I was told by a different tech who picked up the phone, I don't know who it was, ""the pharmacist isn't readily available to talk about your concerns and will reach out to you when possible"". I thought that was weird, I've never had a pharmacist not take a call, sometimes I've had a long wait, but never been told that they couldn't talk to me at all, and I didn't even state the concerns that I had. So I asked to please speak to *, the tech that I had just talked to, and when they picked up I asked them if it were possible to put a note in my profile that I called about an issue with my Dilaudid prescription, so it shows that I did attempt to report an issue and they said ""absolutely, unfortunately we've had an influx of patients calling in and the pharmacist has a few to contact in front of you, but I'm sure it won't be long"", I said ""okay thank you, *"" and hung up.


So that's where we are. The waiting game. Such a fun game. 🙃

1q1xrux,Pain Network News,"

Greetings,

""Stop this insanity!"" That's how one patient describes the DEA's decade-long effort to cut the supply of opioid pain medication. Over 5,000 people recently left comments in the Federal Register, most pleading with DEA not to reduce production quotas for opioids again in 2026.

From opioids to gabapentin to cannabis, there was a lot of news to cover last year about chronic pain and chronic illness. See the 5 most widely read articles in PNN in 2025.

President Trump's executive order rescheduling cannabis is unlikely to have an immediate effect on pain patients. It could take years for FDA-approved cannabis-based pain medications to become available.

A review of clinical studies found that THC in cannabis products is more effective than CBD in providing pain relief. 

Have you heard of PEMF or pulsed electromagnetic field therapy? It's like a TENS or neuromodulation device that helps sore muscles and joints heal. PNN's Madora Pennington tried PEMF and found it relaxing and soothing to old injuries.
 
First it was ""handicapped."" Then came ""disabled."" Or ""challenged."" PNN's Carol Levy says the labels used to describe people with disabilities often don't fit what someone is able -- or unable -- to do.

1q1v6wk,Terrible pregabalin and duloxetine withdrawal,"Hey guys, I have been taking pregabalin 100 mg and duloxetine 75mg for one month for a pain caused by injury (waiting for surgery) and I had to go cold turkey stopping these meds because of it worsening my chronic disease (ofc asked the doctor, she said it wouldn't worsen my disease and she was wrong - it's actually written in side effects).

So it's been 3 weeks since me stopping these meds and I feel horrible - my dry eye disease pain is way worse, feel like I am about to vomit all the time, I do have intensive dreams at night (I rarely had any dreams at all).

Do you guys have some success stories of it getting better? I feel like it won't go away.

After many months of stability, I woke up this morning with severe spasms in my neck. It’s gotten to the point where it pulsates with pain even when sitting still. I’m unfortunately traveling and cannot find a cervical collar anywhere. Two doses of 10 mg of chlorzoxazone unfortunately did nothing, even when it’s usually works, and I don’t have any other muscle relaxants. I went to get a massage which did not resolve the problem.

1q1sfi2,"Nose wont stop bleeding, no solution just trauma and pain","Nose started bleeding late last night at almost 4am. Didn’t stop for hours so I went to the ER. They tried a spray, didn’t work. So then they tried the nose tampon… fucking horrible felt like it was pushing into my brain. It didn’t fucking work. So next they had this hard sponge thing in the shape of a nail file. They had to give me Ativan and it still didn’t calm me down (Atp i’ve been in the hospital 5+ hours with no sleep and no food since the night before). But I went through with it… That was some of the worst pain i’ve experienced, and Ive dislocated joints many a time. I screamed and after just sat there curled up unable to speak for a while. 


But it seemed to work. Went home, cuddled my dog and kitten and ate food. The whole nostril that was packed felt like it was on fire. Then abt 7 hours later the blood started gushing again.


so now im back. I didn’t want to try another thing up my nose but this (asshole) doc is pushing hard for a ballon up the nose. Advocated a bit and now they are going to give me ketamine for it. Im still freaking out. 


Started crying bloody tears. 


Im honestly really scared. Ive never had ketamine for a procedure. Also everything doctors have told me today about pain has been a HUGE underestimate. So I don’t trust anything they say. Also none of the other things used to put pressure on it have worked so why should I believe this one will?

1q1qthe,I have Fibromyalgia and some back issues and am used to chronic pain but has anyone developed increased pain or arthritis-type symptoms after coming off Prednisone or other steroids?,"In March of 2024 I was in the hospital with bad pneumonia and interstitial lung disease, after which I got prescribed 60mg of Prednisone. I was on that level for 2 months or so and didn't fully taper off of it until late August. I no longer have ILD or pneumonia so it did its job. It was awesome being on it because I felt great lol...

But about 2 weeks after my last dose, I started to develop a lot of pain in my joints, along with stiffness and a heavy feeling. The motions of sitting down or standing up became particularly difficult as it mostly bothered my hips and knees. 

I immediately contacted Rheumatology and my pulmonologist and my pulmonologist said that I wouldn't have reactive arthritis from coming off Prednisone, and rheum took xrays of my back and neck and said I have some osteoarthritis but not enough to treat it with an immune-suppressing drug. I was told to take Lyrica or Cymbalta and that should suffice. 

After consulting with my regular PCP I started on Gabapentin but that went REALLY badly. So they put me on 25mg Lyrica to help me sleep in hopes that sleep would ultimately help. I've been on that since July and while I can sleep without Nyquil now, my pain isn't really any better. It has slightly improved in my knees and other joints, but is still there especially now that it is really cold where I live. The only thing that actually helps the pain is Ibuprofen, which I am not taking too often as I have a hiatal hernia that I don't want to agitate. 

I feel like they think it's all in my head and I'm getting a hysterectomy in 19 days and what I'm really concerned about is the fact that apparently the hardest thing is going from sitting or laying down to standing and right now that is still incredibly difficult for me WITHOUT the hysterectomy lol. So that's super awesome lol 

Now once I'm up and around for a while, I can move relatively ok. I have been practicing balancing, squats, getting up off the floor without supporting myself with my hands, etc. so it's not for lack of movement. The ONLY thing I can point to is coming off the steroid. I don't even know who, in this rural area, I could turn to for a second opinion but I have to get past the surgery first. However, I want to make plans to get this taken care of because it's really impacting my ability to function. 

Do you think it'd be worth it to try to find someone to give me a second opinion? I live in a pretty rural area and healthcare here is really bad in general but I could go an hour+ away if I really had to. I'm just used to being positive and powering through and being able to move even if it hurts. This stuff is preventing me from being able to move, and that is gnawing at my mental health and I don't think it's in my head but I also don't know what could have caused it if it wasn't coming off Prednisone. I'm just so tired. 

Thanks for listening and any insight.

1q1q2j0,Pharmacy mistakes.,"My Dilaudid prescription is 16 pills short (4 days) and has multiple broken pills, no pieces fitting together, that I discovered once I reached the bottom of the bottle. I know there's nothing I can do to fix the problem as is, I just have to take less pills for the rest of the prescription duration so that I don't run out and withdrawal. Unfortunately that means being in more pain for the next week. Should I still notify the pharmacy and/or my pain management provider of the mistakes, or will that flag me as someone sort of drug seeker? I don't abuse my prescription and only take as prescribed so I know it was their mistake. Should I count them at the register before accepting them from now on? There's 120 pills which would take a bit of the techs time away from other patients. But this really can't happen again. Maybe have the pharmacist count them at the consultation counter before handing them over? Or would even asking for this flag me?",1767331185.0,50,140,ChronicPain,mental_physical

Sometimes so painful I would almost pass out. The neurologist suggested Botox. I have been doing that since then and had relief. But as of 3 months ago the pain has come back with a vengeance. Debilitating head pain that makes me non-functioning. It literally feels like I'm on fire from the inside. My neurologist has offered nothing but continuing the Botox and high doses of Gabapentin. I can't work. I can't participate in my children's activities. I'm completely useless. No one will help with the pain. You are automatically a drug seeker. This pain is different than anything I have ever had in my headache journey but no one will listen. I just need a doctor to listen and hear me.

I was like “What the what?!” Well, I tried to think I’m hot stuff, strong and healthy but nope still have fibromyalgia, still have neuropathy, still don’t sleep well at night because of temperature dysregulation, still have TMJD, still have eyebags and dark circles under my eyes from lack of sleep.

Every time I go to the clinic I have to show that I’m wearing the patch. I’m having trouble taking the patches the way they are prescribed because my pain isn’t under control. I’m not going into detail because I don’t want this post removed. My concern is that I have to show them that I have my patch on when I visit the clinic. I don’t know if I will have a patch to put on my body by the time of my next appointment. I know there are bandaids that have a similar texture and size. Should I use that and hope for the best? It seems like when the medical assistant asks to see it, they just glance at it. I know I could just lie and say it fell off and wouldn’t get in trouble. I’ve had times where I have had trouble keeping them on before, so it’s not implausible that it really could have come off. I have never done anything to raise any red flags before this. I really don’t want to have to do random med counts or increased drug tests. The office is almost an hour away. Also, I work forty hours a week, so I would hate to miss work because I randomly got called to do a med count or drug test. 

Please don’t be harsh or judge me. I’m really going through it. I was responsible for a long time. I never thought I would end up in this position, but my pain gets so bad that all I can do is cry sometimes. I feel really stupid for getting myself into this situation. I used to judge people who would do stupid shit like this. I get a pain injection next month, but it only helped for a week when I got it a few months ago. Desperate times call for desperate measures. Hopefully I will be able to take my meds as prescribed the next go-round. I have suffered without adequate pain management in the past and I can do it again.

1q1k01f,Looking for shared experiences managing acute pain + sleep issues,"Not asking for medical advice — just hoping to hear others’ personal experiences.

I recently had eye surgery and have been on strict activity restrictions. With no movement allowed, my insomnia has flared up again, and my doctor prescribed a very short course (3 nights) of temazepam to help me sleep.

On top of that, I pulled a muscle in my neck this morning and now have significant stiffness and pain with almost no range of motion. I still have cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) from a prior injury. I’ve already cleared with my doctor that low doses of both medications are okay if spaced out.

I’m mainly curious from a lived-experience standpoint:
	•	Have any of you noticed benzodiazepines helping muscle tension or spasms?
	•	Or have you personally managed acute muscle pain earlier in the evening and taken a sleep med later on?

I’m pretty uncomfortable and just trying to get through recovery and get one solid night of rest. I really appreciate hearing what’s worked (or not worked) for others dealing with chronic pain flares.

1q1iz05,"When friends offer help, how do you take them up on it?","I’ll start this off saying I’m super super grateful to have a village of chosen family who genuinely care about me and have made every stride to include me as my health had deteriorated over the last 2 years. They modify events for my spoon levels, they come to me on days I can’t leave the house, they never make me feel like a burden. I truly am blessed. I can recognize that from a logical perspective. 

However I’m also *deeply* traumatized by bio family and have deep seated abandonment and trust issues.  I’ve made a lot of strides having faith that they will have my back, they will keep loving me (which they have cuz they’re good people who choose to be my friends) but now I’ve come to a new dilemma. 

Depending on a few things surgery may be in my future and I mentioned that to a friend last night and he says “anything you need just let me know I’m happy to come over and help or bring. For surgery absolutely but just like. In general. You know, we’re always here for you.” which I’ve heard from people over my life but this time it hit different, I felt like I could actually trust him to come through. 

But my question is, what does one even ask for? I live with my partner and my best friend who is also a huge support person. And I’m trying really hard not to lean on them 24/7 which is hard when your bed bound half the time.

1q1iyoz,"As the New Year begins, I wanted to share something small but meaningful.","I’ve been living with Long Covid and ME/CFS for about two years now. It’s been a journey of slowing down, grieving old rhythms, and learning how to stay connected in gentler ways. My close friend lives with ME/CFS as well as endometriosis, and we often talked about how isolating this life can feel.

Out of that shared experience, we created a small, calm Discord space called **The Ever-Tired Inn** — a soft, low-pressure community for people living with chronic illness, fatigue, or similar challenges.

There’s no expectation to be active, upbeat, or productive. You’re welcome to talk, vent, rest, lurk, or simply exist alongside others who understand.

1q1i50f,PDMP Question (Maryland),"Happy new year!

Random question, but I see a pain management doctor for monthly scripts of a CDS.  I also had surgery last month and they gave me 7 extended release tramadol upon my release.  I planned to disclose this to my doctor regardless but she proactively asked me about it at the start of my appointment.  

Does the database proactively alert doctors to other scripts being given by other providers or something?  Years ago I had a dentist prescribe Tylenol 3 after a dental procedure and my pain mgmt doctor didn't proactively ask that time (I disclosed and brought the bottle in just in case they wanted to see it).

1q1h778,I don't know what's happening to me but I know my pain is a part of it,"Hi! I'm hoping someone here might be able to relate because I feel like I'm going crazy.  

Ive had chronic pain forever because of migraines. I've been through those pain programs and inpatient education treatments so while I'm definitely no expert, I get the very very basics of the pain cycle and coping mechanisms, biofeedback, mind/body balance and all that. About two years ago I started getting horrible, constant pain in my hip that my doctor could not figure out. It was awful and physically limiting but I could still manage my life, just not the way I wanted. Fortunately they figured out the issue and I had surgery about 3 months ago. My surgeon was clear that while the surgery would fix the source of the pain, it would be awhile before all the pain caused by compensation and muscle issues would get better.  While I am slowly improving (🤞🙏) I still have a lot of pain - different intensity and quality than I'm used to - and when it flares up (which is very often at this stage) I cannot get it under control. My surgeons office is amazing but I get the impression they think it's more tolerable than it is and they keep trying different strong anti-inflammatories that give me horrible side effects and aren't helping.   I'm trying small amts of gummies and anything else I can throw at it but no luck so far.  But whats making everything worse is my nervous system seems totally out of balance and my PT thinks it's become hyper sensitive. 

Ever since I had surgery my frustration threshold, pain tolerance and distraction techniques have all changed. I'm on medication for anxiety and its like taking a sugar pill. My regular dose does nothing for some reason.  Sometimes it feels like a weird depression in that I haven't lost interest in doing the things I like to do - they just all irritate me. Everything I used to do to relax or distract myself doesn't work and actually becomes overwhelming, like watching TV, listening to a podcast, playing a game on my phone, even a snuggle with my kids. I don't want to be touched, none of my comfy clothes are comfortable, I can't focus, things get too loud way too quickly etc. My constant state seems stuck at ""on edge"". Lately I feel like if I can't find a way to relax or deal with this  I'm going to go crazy. I'm really desperate some days and feel like I'm climbing the walls. 

Has anyone here experienced something similar or can possibly relate, from either chronic pain and/or surgery?  Why is nothing working? Is it some sort of body trauma from surgery that I need time to heal from?  What might help? The most I've found is taking a shower or as much sensory deprivation I can get, haha - lights off, noise cancelling ear buds in, laying still on my bed. My brain is so bored but somehow staring at the wall is more tolerable than watching TV.  My husband doesn't understand how just a small conversation where I need to make decisions or plan logistics is so overwhelming. I've had horrible multi week migraines that I could manage better than this. I don't have that many balls in the air but I'm still dropping them, and  I start each day with way less spoons so to speak. Will I ever go back to feeling like me again? I'm not looking for pure bliss or anything, haha, but just that brief ""ahhhhhh yeahhh"" moment like when you take your bra off at the end of the day or sit down with a favorite blanket, or that first bite of a favorite dessert.

1q194t2,Medisafe App Now Pay Only Here is a Free Alternative,"Note: This review is my own based on my personal experience. I do not work nor have not worked for either app mentioned. 

If you use Medisafe to keep track of your meds, like I did,  you might have woken up to a bit of a problem today. Medisafe has gone subscription only & legacy users are being forced to pay or leave. Mine finally kicked me out, a year after they announced subscription access. What a start to 2026.

Like many of you, I cannot afford to pay for subscription to every app.  Over the past year I've tested multiple free medication tracking apps.

I was looking for an app that allowed flexibility  with dosing - multiple times per day, weird intervals (every 3 days), as needed medication.  Options to track other things like medisafe if you want.

The winner was Pillo. It's free on Android, sorry iPhone users, I'm not sure for you. 

Upsides
Adding meds is easy and you can even include your own picture of the medication. I've used it for a year with no issues. For those who forget to take meds, it will take over your phone screen until you confirm you have taken the meds. 

Downsides:
Limited options in colours /shapes for pills /medications compared to Medisafe. You cannot customize the medication sound. There are rare ads. 

Bonus: 
Taking 100% of your meds gives you hearts (or watching a short ad). You can select which  of several charities you want your ""hearts"" go to .",1767287349.0,7,2,ChronicPain,mental_physical

I had chronic pain already and then I had a surgery three years ago that made it worse
The surgeon added in a much more complex procedure to the docket that involved cutting and moving bone which I specifically did not want.

He convinced me 15 min before surgery.

I trusted him. I liked him- still do…. He seems caring. I think he believed this surgery would help.

I cannot have anymore surgeries to correct it.had four total surgeries on this foot so I need to just leave it alone.

So my foot is likely always going to be deformed.
It’s an invisible - most think it looks normal but physical therapy sees then shift- yes uncomfortable and often 10/10 pain. It’s amazing how a few mm off with your heal, arch and side of your food can cause so much pain. 

Psychologically- how do I move through this?

Also- at some point will my body still firing pain signals due to misalignment?

I’m doing all the things
PT, massage, shoe inserts- soon I’ll be doing orthotics and braces.

But it’ll never be the same. 

Had he listened and asked why I didn’t want bone changes - he would’ve learned a lot about my body and prob decided against it….

I’m very bendy (hyper mobile). My bones are already weird. And every bone surgery I’ve had went wrong. 

I have thoughts of suicide but would never leave my family. But I sometimes imagine just not waking up.

I get pain meds, but it’s not enough. I get maybe 8 hours a day of turned down pain because I’ve always metabolized opioids really fast. 

I need some hope
When will my nervous system stop screaming at me every time I take a step? 

I have been able to do things in the past like go dancing- very rarely… and quite a lot of alcohol was needed. But I just had a finally surgery to correct things and it didn’t work. 

How can I forgive someone that legally won’t say sorry? Why do I care more about his feelings than my own life? I should have been so much more assertive when I first noticed the issue but I trusted him and trusted the process. I cry hysterically most days when I’m alone. I can’t go on like this

I need therapy but the therapist I found tried to convince me to not be upset… by berating me - and telling me how much worse it could all be … it’s was very strange. ",1767259925.0,6,12,ChronicPain,mental_physical

On Christmas day, in the morning, things came to a head and I ended up with my daughters, 10 and 17, in tears and wanted to go to my parents house (for Christmas lunch) early.

I stood up to my husband and my dad, who had come to get us, stood outside with my girls. He said that he was so proud of me for standing up to him, for everything I had said. He told my mum that he was proud of me, and then told me the same thing later on. He even said he had been thinking ""You go girl"" lol If you knew my dad, you would know how funny that was lol

Boxing Day, I was a mess! I couldn't stop crying and my 10yo said ""You are still scarred by what happened"".

My dad said that my eldest, 17, actually said ""why can't they just get divorced""... 

She had gone in to his room to talk to him - I said she could do that and could decide if she wanted to come with me and 10yo early... she came out crying, saying she couldn't deal with this anymore.

Christmas night, when my 10yo was asleep, she was crying out for her dad and asking why he had yelled the way he had done.

I have now got my parents and my aunty (I have two that are happy I'm leaving, but only one of them lives nearby) on board and are helping me to make the preparations I need to do before I leave him safely. My parents are sorting their house out so me and the girls will all have our own rooms - but they have to be careful that he doesn't figure out what they are doing.

My dad asked me what they could tell my brother. He was *fuming* when I told him that my brother will be on his side - that he is more his friend than he is my brother. I said that he won't believe me. Dad looked so *angry* and said that he would believe me by the time Dad was done with him.

My mum had told my aunty - the one that isn't local - that my husband doesn't treat me well. She would *never* normally confined in her about anything, so it was really telling that she did that.

It was the first Christmas in *well over* 10 years that we had everyone there, kids and all, and apparently it was unavoidable, that everyone had seen how distressed I was and that I was in tears. My family is very English, so no one said anything about it but I got a lot more hugs than normal that day.

My husband had come to Christmas once he had calmed down because my dad was trying to make sure he didn't know that things were as bad as they were since I had to go home.

I have been told to open an account that he doesn't know about and get a phone that he doesn't know about so he can't track me with it.

One of my hobbies has been 3d printing. I got into well before this journey started. I always enjoyed making little things. And it didn't take long before I started giving away things when I was done with them. And then making gifts....the 3d printing path.

One day, I came across this great little print. I found it on Thingiverse, and I am a little too medicated right now to be organized enough to credit the creator. Such a wonderful print that showed one of the most incredible aspects of print-in-place. I started printing them in batches. When I can gather myself to leave the house, I bring some happy little gekos 

I try to give them out at any opportunity. If your kid needs a distraction in a waiting room, have a geko. If you rang through my order at the store, have a geko. Dental hygienist who had to deal with my face? Here are gekos to select from, and of course you can have an extra for your nephew.

I have had some wonderful interactions over these. Lovely lady that was cutting cloth for my wife, I gave her a purple one to match her glasses. She shared with us that it reminded her of the flowers that she loved at her grandmothers home in the Philippines.

Anytime that I have been asked to sell them, I decline. The design is not mine, and that's not the point. I will print as many and more that people ask for so that they can gift them.

I might have trouble some days, fighting through the bad days, and wishing for the good. But I can still make someone smile. Not looked for, not asked for, but the happy little geko keeps smiling. And for me this last year, it has been enough.",1767228680.0,7,5,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1q0r1f8,The worst thing you can say to your child with chronic pain,"Typing this here because I’m reflecting on an argument with my mom and I’m honestly just appalled. It’s so secret that she doesn’t accept the fact that I’m disabled, nor does she believe in my condition I just never actually expected her to…say it to my face. Been in a flare up the past few days that irritated her and today she finally snapped. Told me how much she hated me, how miserable and depressed I made her. She said she wanted a normal kid to do normal activities with and have a normal family. How she was tired of accommodating for me, tired of me having to rest from doing basic activities, how I’m so fucking lazy and how If im gonna be like this the rest of my life then ill be her biggest regret. How she didn’t sacrifice everything for a child like me. To top it all off she said that if she ever offed herself it would be my fault and she wanted to make sure I knew that. How much happier she would be if I wasn’t in her life. It’s odd. I’m not hurt by this, she says a lot of harsh stuff she doesn’t mean I’m just…appalled? That she thought those words through and decided they were appropriate to say to her child. I’m trying my damn hardest I’m sorry I’m disabled I didn’t ask for this either.

Well that last thing has recently flaired up as unbearable sharp muscle spasms in my upper back. Worried I hurt something more, I called the after hours line at my pain doctor last Friday.

So he said to go to the ER and get a new CT. Said he'd then get me in on Tuesday (the first day he was open this week). 

So I did. CT said no new fractures so that's good.

But here's where I gotta thank my doctor so much for being amazing.

Monday morning I called first thing to book the Tuesday appointment. The nurse there knew it was me and was waiting for my call, and had a spot saved for me Tue morning on my doctor's orders.

Well then my doctor yesterday at my appt checks me out, looks at the CT and says basically ""I know you're tough and not one to complain about pain, so it must be really bad. Let's give you a couple weeks of Vicodin to take up to 4x a day and a muscle relaxer"".

Folks with this combo my back is actually calming down finally. I think in a week or so it'll be better and I can return to my normal routine 

I just.... I hear so many horrible stories of doctors withholding pain meds and being unsympathetic. I just have to say it makes me so so thankful for a pain doctor who actually listens, who isn't terrified to prescribe opiods in situations where they're appropriate, and who really cares about me as a patient.

I grew up in the 60’s and there was nothing in place for a bad back where I lived. As I grew up, I had back pain but I thought it was just a normal thing, as I did a fair amount of sports and chalked it up to stretched out muscles. FF 40 years. I had a lum lam for wretched sciatica. It helped! Now, they don’t do them anymore because the pain comes back. 20 years later, now 67 and a career of heavy lifting being a surgical nurse,  i struggle to maintain function. It is “too late” to do any more surgeries as the discs are gone and the vertebral bodies are collapsed, from C5 to S1. 
I live by just getting by with epidurals and RFA’s. Gabapentin 900mg/day in lower doses helps nerve pain. Baclofen twice a day. Oxycodone 5mg twice daily. Have tried PT for years, TENS unit and the vibrating heating pads. 
My advice to all of the young patients on this platform: start now! Do everything you can to combat this diagnosis. Have the surgery while you’re young. Rehab will be a cake walk compared to a life of pushing through it daily. Im old now and finally retired. Have some years left in me hopefully, but I can’t travel or do much of anything.

1q0f8ut,Spinal Ostioid Osteoma,"New here — looking to connect with others with spinal osteoid osteoma

Hi everyone. I’m posting on behalf of my daughter, Gabby, who is 14 years old. After a long and difficult stretch of unexplained pain, her orthopedic surgeon suspects an osteoid osteoma in her spine.

Her details:

	•	Age: 14

	•	Location of suspected OO: Left L5 superior articular process (lumbar facet joint)

	•	Symptoms: constant back pain, leg pain, and severe night pain

	•	History: severe scoliosis since infancy

	•	Spine surgery history: growth rods as a child, followed by a long spinal fusion from T2–L4 in April 2023

Because of the location (just below the fusion) and the complex anatomy, the surgeon isn’t yet certain she’s a candidate for CT-guided radiofrequency ablation. If ablation isn’t possible, surgery may be required.

We’re trying to learn from others who’ve had:

	•	Lumbar or facet-joint osteoid osteomas

	•	OO below a spinal fusion

	•	Ablation vs surgical outcomes in complex cases

I’ve attached a simple diagram showing her fusion and where the suspected OO is located to help explain her anatomy.

1q0f8j2,17 years of fighting… for what?,"I’m sorry in advance for the long post- I desperately need to vent. I don’t normally say anything, I am the silent lurker who reads everything and says prayers, sends positive energy, and suffers without letting others know. Today is different.

I’ve been sick a long time. Technically the first time my symptoms appeared in a way that doctors paid attention was 17 years ago during the pregnancy of my first son. To make a long story short I began experiencing unbearable pain in my hips and eventually couldn’t walk without assistance but no imaging could be done because I was pregnant. After his 3 month checkup I finally was sent for an MRI, only to discover that what they thought was an inflammatory muscle issue, was actually avascular necrosis of both femoral heads, which at that point had completely collapsed and at age 29, I had to get bilateral hip replacements. This would typically be caused by trauma or steroid use (prednisone) but I had neither. That’s what got them looking into what was happening in my body- but to be honest there were symptoms long before that, the doctors just didn’t see them for the red flags they were.

Now I am not going to get into my medical history. We’ll be here all day. What I will say is that ultimately I have never gotten a diagnosis even though something has ravaged my body. It’s killed my bones, eaten away my soft tissue, deformed my joints, caused multiple strokes and TIA, damaged my lungs, caused me to not absorb nutrients and essentials like iron and b-vitamins. It’s caused wounds where my body is eating itself, nonstop weakness, exhaustion and pain- just to give a small highlight reel.

Through it all, I have been stubborn and determined. When my body said “no”- I said “screw you, I have a family to take care of”. I defied medical odds. I walked on bones incapable of supporting me and found my way back after a major stroke paralyzed half my body. I fought my way through pain most people can never imagine and even though things started taking me longer and were harder and harder to do- I did them. Not because I wanted to, but because I had children relying on me and it was my responsibility to not only love them, but take care of them and provide the best home life possible for them.

I can’t express how hard it was on me. The pushing myself through pain and exhaustion. Standing there cooking while my legs shook uncontrollably and my hands cramped. Forcing myself to take those painful steps on dying bones, use my hands as the fingers deformed into grotesque, stuck, twisted, shapes. Using my shoulders as dying bones ground against each other, shoving socks and slippers onto feet swollen 4x their size and covered with open wounds- the list goes on and on and on.

A year ago my body finally started winning. My hands became too weak to even pull up my pants. I switched to loose pajama pants. No more bras. I couldn’t open anything and could barely carry anything. My fingers were too crumpled and hands to weak to wipe a counter, much less do dishes. I could barely hold my own silverware or toothbrush. My legs gave up too- a small handful of steps and they would just quit, causing me to collapse. If I sit down, I need help getting back up more often than not. In all honesty I should be using my wheelchair- but I can’t (I’ll explain momentarily). If it was up to my body I would barely get out of bed.

Obviously my decline has been noticed. The problem is that NO ONE is even attempting to help pick up the slack. The dishes will sit there for days until I drag a chair to the kitchen and spend a literal hour to unload and load the dishwasher, dropping things left and right. Dinner will go uncooked unless I find a way to cook something- except on Saturday and Sunday when my husband is off work and was already “cooking” on those days (we eat out one day and have either microwave or oven garbage the next). Laundry piles up until the kids have nothing to wear and literally start wearing dirty clothes and I finally have no choice but to hurt myself immensely to try to do it. Other things just go undone- there are piles of unorganized clutter everywhere. The bathrooms don’t get cleaned. The vacuum gets run in a small area once or twice a week but never the entire house. Sheets haven’t been changed in months. You get the idea.

I bring all of this up. I ask for help. I explain how it emotionally hurts me to see the mess and not be able to do anything about it and how it physically hurts me to do what I am still being forced to do.

It’s met with both hostility and indifference. How dare I expect others to take on the “burden” of “my responsibilities”- it’s too much to ask and unfair. On top of that, a complete lack of care, concern or even basic compassion for the way I feel physically or emotionally. I’ve managed so far, why can’t I keep doing it? Why am I suddenly being lazy and expecting everyone to cater to me? (In the meantime I as almost nothing for myself- help getting up sometimes and help opening my medication, coffee creamer, toothpaste or small things like that.

I’m still a full time mom. Both of my children have special needs. One has high functioning autism and multiple psychological problems- the other has severe ADHD and a sensory processing disorder. The ONLY thing I don’t handle is the bedtime routine. (They are 16 and 10, so it’s not a big thing).

I’m also still the one who handles the mental load- keeping up with appointments, school events, keeping the house stocked up with everything, making sure the kids have clothes that fit and for the right season, making sure we don’t run out of pet food, organizing and doing everything for every holiday and special occasion, etc. My husband does the grocery shopping (with the list I make) and does the driving because I no longer can. He also works a 9-5 job FROM HOME.

What happens when they want to go do something fun? Do they try to find something where I will be able to be included? No. I’m just left behind and/or left out.

Does anyone try to help me at all? No. Not unless I very specifically ask and 9/10 times it’s treated like an inconvenience or chore.

I don’t blame my children for this. I blame my husband who set the bar for this years ago and no matter how much I begged and explained what he was doing, he acted like I was exaggerating and overreacting.

Now, here I am very close to losing all of my independence and being completely reliant on the 3 of them for my care after spending 17 years BREAKING MYSELF to make their lives better- and not only do they not appreciate what I did, but they aren’t even trying to take care of me.

I’m genuinely scared of what is going to happen when my body takes away my last independence- when I can no longer force those few steps, no longer manipulate the silverware, no longer put on my shirt, no longer FORCE MYSELF through agony to do basic tasks to function.

I only get to shower once every few MONTHS. I rely on sponge baths and washing my hair in the sink (both of which are almost impossible with severely deformed fingers that are too weak to barely lift my wet hair or wring out the washcloth) because my husband won’t fix the handicap bar I need to safely get in/out of the shower or replace my shower chair he broke. It’s been 2.5 years. The bar is a 10 minute fix.

I can’t use my electric wheelchair for several reasons- (1) he ruined the battery because it’s supposed to stay plugged in. He unplugged it and put it in a drawer for no good reason. Now it won’t charge and can’t hold a charge per the manufacturer and replacement batteries are expensive so he won’t get one. (2) Even if I somehow got one, the house has been rearranged to how he likes it and on top of that the clutter is everywhere so there’s no path or room for a wheelchair.

BTW, I can’t use a manual wheelchair because my hands are too deformed and weak to propel myself but even if I could, there’s no path for it either. I can’t even use my walker and no matter how much I ask, no matter how I approach it, he spends his free time relaxing and in all honesty just being lazy. I am not a priority. A clean house is not a priority. Our children are not a priority. If left up to him, he would never do anything except work his job and relax. He is a narcissist and by the time I figured it out, I was trapped. 

So here I am, literally terrified of what my future holds and wondering why the hell I fought so hard to give other people a good life, instead of looking out for myself. It advanced the progression of many of my issues- causing things to happen in 4-5 years that should have taken a minimum of 10, typically closer to 20. 

Yes, I’m a Mom. I didn’t want my children to suffer because of my illness- but at the same time, I saw when they slowly started taking it and me for granted. I watched as their father taught them it was okay to exclude the “weak link”. I noticed that as I slowed down no one tried to help and my pleas were met with guilt trips, hostility and shame. So why did I keep doing it? What was the point?

Did I really believe that if I just kept killing myself it would somehow prove to them that I deserved to be taken care of when I could no longer function? If so, why didn’t I recognize that I shouldn’t ever have had to prove anything, they should’ve loved me enough to want to do it?

I don’t know. I’m just hurt, scared, stuck in an awful situation and feeling like I threw away myself and put myself through so much torture- for nothing. Like what was the point? Why did I fight so hard? I ended up in the same place- unappreciated, unloved (I am sure my children love me- but it’s in the selfish way their Dad taught them because they are boys who quit listening to momma as their main influence by age 6), hurting in every way possible with no one to count on but myself. Except now, I have no choice but to rely on people (meaning my husband mostly) who don’t really care about me or my needs.

So what was the point?

I’m feeling very alone and scared and needed to vent. Thank you for listening.

1q0cai8,Medical Mystery,"Hi! I’m in a tough position healthwise and hoping someone may have some suggestions on where I can go from here?!?

This may be long so I’m apologizing now lol

In 2020 I was diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome… at the time, the diagnosis seemed to explain everything, but over the last few years, symptoms (which I’ll list below) have repeatedly popped up that don’t entirely fit with that diagnosis, leading my several of my doctors (and I) to believe I likely have more going on, like a second larger, overarching diagnosis in addition to EDS - my geneticist going so far as to say she felt like this may be something ultra rare

We’ve done both genome and exome sequencing (as well as TONS of labs, imaging, and other tests), some of which have revealed smaller diagnoses/comorbidities, or acute issues, but nothing has given us an overarching explanation or diagnosis, or seemingly even really gotten us any closer to one

Over the summer, my geneticist referred me to the UDN… they have a site at my local teaching hospital and as I started the application process and talked to different people at the UDN, they all made it seem like the application process was just a formality and I’d be accepted since I’d been referred by a doctor at the same institution, but we just had to go through the motions first

Well, earlier this month I got letter informing me they’d reviewed my records and they wouldn't be pursuing my case further (and they also don’t do appeals) and to be honest, I was crushed… while I had never explicitly been told I’d for sure be accepted (which also unfortunately means I don’t have anything to go back on), it was repeatedly hinted at, and over the last several months, the UDN was the piece of hope I’d been clinging too, as well as many of my specialists…

In the last year or so, a lot of my doctors have slowly started to give up, whether they’ll admit that or not - some because we’re out of options, but I think most of them are just frustrated they can’t figure out what’s going on… I’m almost scared to tell some of them I didn’t get in, as for the last several months, while waiting on the UDN, my care has kind of been on hold, or in limbo, just not moving forward, as so many of my specialists were hoping for answers from the UDN and relying on them for next steps

This specific hospital (where the majority of my doctors are, as well as the UDN site) has let me down again and again and, honestly, even more than a diagnosis, I wanted them to take my case just as validation it’s not in my head, to end the gaslighting, and to maybe help find doctors who truly cared and would fight for me, and not give up on me just because it’s hard, because that’s been the biggest challenge

To make matters worse, when I received the letter, I was (and still am) recovering from a missed diagnosis there that ultimately led to an ICU stay at another hospital, so the timing definitely made the letter sting a little extra… and, while this was at another hospital, it didn’t help that I’d just lost my palliative care doctor that week as well - several of my specialists thought palliative care was a good idea, and have been pushing me to find someone, and she was the only one in a 2ish hour radius who was willing to take on a complex case like mine… she was incredible and left big shoes to fill, though knowing how hard it was to find her, I’m willing to take see about anyone, but we haven’t been able to find a single doctor willing to take me

But anyways, when the denial letter came, it was a Friday evening, and while I don’t usually wallow, I let myself grieve and just feel all the things through the weekend and then messaged my geneticist so we could start to go back to the drawing board, only to find out she’s out on maternity leave until mid January, so even now, I’m still weeks away from being able to talk to her and figure out where to go from here

I have talked to a few of my doctors and none of them are sure what the best next steps are, and I’ve don’t some research too and I’m lost as well, so I’m hoping someone may have some suggestions on where to go next? Or, honestly, even where to start?

Things have progressed a lot over the last year, even in the last several months, and I’m worried that we may be in a ”time is of the essence“ scenario, so even though I feel like my geneticist will likely be the best resource and I may need a referral from her for many places, I want to do what I can now to get the ball rolling

And since I know this may impact things, just to be totally honest, I’m not really in a financial position to travel somewhere… I’ve looked and grants and assistance programs just don’t really exist - they seem to only be a thing in the pediatric world and the few programs that are out there for adults seem to be restricted by diagnosis, and since I don’t really have one, that obviously takes me out of the running… I mean, we could maybe find a way to swing plane tickets if the hospital had significantly discounted or free lodging or we could maybe pay for a night or two at a hotel if it was within driving distance (so somewhere in the Midwest) but that‘s probably it and we could maybe afford to do make a trip somewhere once

And also, just to throw it out there, Mayo isn't really an option and I’ve previously seen doctors at Cleveland Clinic as well, who, unfortunately, weren’t much help

Also, I need anyone I see to take insurance, too, as I definitely can’t afford to pay out of pocket to be seen somewhere… I know private pay clinics and concierge models are popping up all over the place, and while I see the appeal on both sides and I’ve heard great things, it’s unfortunately just not something I can afford right now

So in short, I need doctors (either who will consult via telehealth, are in the Midwest, or that I can travel to with the financial help of some organization or program, or even the hospital itself) who can help me find and diagnosis and who will listen and advocate for me!! Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions!!

Symptoms:

\- severe GI motility issues, in both stomach (gastroparesis) and my intestines, first requiring a j tube, and now TPN reliant, plus a colectomy (after years of severe constipation that wouldn’t respond to treatment, and eventually finding my colon actually moved backwards) and a likely permanent ileostomy… I also struggle with severe nausea, recurrent GI bleeding, obstructions, diversion colitis, malabsorption, etc… I’ve also gained a significant amount of weight, and despite not eating and having my TPN decreased to the lowest amount that I can possibly get while still giving my body enough nutrients, the number on the scale has continued to go up

\- massive stoma issues, including several blockages and obstructions, mystery growths (they’ve been biopsies but the report literally contradicted itself), and spontaneous separation that requires a revision

\- diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, but atypical presentation? Like no symptoms at diagnosis other than fatigue, but my cortisol was so critical at the time that I should've been in a coma

\- PCOS and extremely irregular periods (like I’ll go months without a period, but also have been bleeding for 6 wks), as well as chronic pelvic “pain”, almost like a brick is constantly sitting in my pelvis

\- a spontaneous breast cyst that went from nothing to fist sized in under a week

\- recurrent infections, which often don’t respond to antibiotics even when they should (but no immune deficiency on labs)

\- Poor wound healing (slow, splits open, infections, etc)

\- several blood clots, including multiple DVTs and PEs, plus countless fibrin sheaths on my lines, which often grow rapidly (with normal clotting labs)

\- several vascular compressions, specifically MALS, Nutcracker, May Thurner, and Pelvic Congestion

\- Issues w/ arms and legs giving out… it started with my hands just giving out momentarily without warning (usually just long enough I’d drop whatever was in my hands) a few times a month, which just seemed like clumsiness, but as it slowly increased to weekly, daily, and now multiple times a day, it became a red flag… NCS/EMG was normal, but recently my legs started to do it too, and now they just buckle without warning once or twice a day and I’ve started falling

\- Recurrent issues with anemia and blood counts… I get iron infusions several times a year, but they even still have dropped so low so quickly I’ve required blood transfusions before, and we still don’t know why

\- Generalized weakness and fatigue

(as well as diagnoses of MCAS and POTS, plus joint pain/instability, which are consistent with EDS… I know some of the other things I listed are too but also could be unrelated)",1767185457.0,2,1,ChronicPain,mental_physical

1q09b5e,Could this be me cfs ?,"For approximately two years, I have been experiencing continuous (24/7) symptoms that began after a viral infection (possibly COVID) combined with significant psychological stress. Since onset, the symptoms have remained stable without clear remissions or significant progression.

The most prominent symptom is a constant sensation in my head described as brain fog or a “drugged / mildly intoxicated” feeling, accompanied by a sense of internal pressure in the head, mainly frontal, temporal, and sinus-like. This does not resemble a typical headache, but rather a heavy, fatigued, and dulled brain sensation. Symptoms are usually worse in the morning upon waking and tend to improve slightly as the day progresses.

I also experience persistent visual disturbances, including visual snow, afterimages, and floaters. These symptoms are more noticeable in low-light conditions, against white backgrounds, when looking at the sky, and in environments with intense lighting and visual complexity (e.g. supermarkets), where I experience significant visual overstimulation.

Additionally, I have sound sensitivity, particularly to sudden or metallic noises, along with an exaggerated startle response. It feels as though my nervous system is constantly in a state of hyperarousal.

Regarding energy levels, I experience continuous fatigue, predominantly cognitive rather than physical, similar to the feeling of having slept only a few hours. Despite this, I am able to exercise (gym, cycling) without experiencing worsening

Brain MRI (without contrast), multiple blood tests, and ophthalmologic examinations have all been normal, with no identified structural or organic cause.

Question:

Given the absence of post-exertional malaise and the stable, non-progressive nature of symptoms, could this presentation still be consistent with ME/CFS, or is it more suggestive of a post-viral neurological or autonomic dysregulation syndrome?",1767174675.0,3,3,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1q094b8,How do you even get tested for things and helped? Its like no dr cares,"This year, I suddenly became severely iron deficient, got gastritis from drs throwing a ton of meds at me (steroids, antibiotics, allergy meds, nsaids), then i got covid, I got iron infusions but felt worse in different ways, and I learned my vitamin d became deficient and my B12 dropped a ton, and who knows about the other levels not usually tested. I also suddenly got lower back pain, nausea, completely lost my appetite, and my urine sinks to the bottom of the bowl. I'm having extreme fatigue, bone pain, and tingling, but no dr ive been to recently has wanted to investigate anything. Theyre making me feel crazy. even the ""nice"" nurse i was recommended, seemed irritated i wanted to look into why this is happening. I also wanted to test my phosphorus because i learned if my D gets low, that give me hypophosphatemia if i get iron infusions.

They say most of my blood work looks normal, and they did test most things, but not specific things. I keep having people suggest looking into things like the parathyroid, tests for autoimmune diseases, and other things, but they wont do it. They just keep telling me to take meds, two of them gave me no real advice and that was it. I dont know what to do bc the urgent care is useless, ER only looks for things actively killing you, and my pcps are the only options, and i have no clue why they arent looking into anything.

I would have thought if i had a symptom, theyd look for why, what it means, and how to deal with it, but instead they see most labs are ""normal"" (while some were pretty low fyi, he also took some right after i took some supplements and claimed im better now), and call it a day. Wtf am i supposed to ask to learn why i became anemic, or why my bones hurt, or how to get better...

The worst part is many seem to be like ""you arent looking stuff up online, are you\~"", which is crazy because like, YEAH, i am! Im desperately seeking help bc im not getting any from the ppl paid to do it!! If I have slow healing, protein in my urine, or white hairs, why not look into that??

Does anyone have any tips or anything?? I've been losing so much weight over the past weeks and my bones hurt all the time now. Idk what to do and the drs think im nuts when i get sad about it all :( I dont know why they'd think im making it up, as if i want these thousands of dollars worth of medical bills and to be dismissed over and over while in pain

1q08f52,Doctors refusing to give me my meds.,"I'm using the medications in order to manage my severe pain and to cope with the trauma of life. For the last 3 years my life has been absolutely destroyed from a lung condition where sometimes i cough up buckets of mucus every day and no doctor has been able to diagnose. No antibiotic has worked. Please don't ask me about this because I'm tired of explaining all the testing and the 300+ X-rays and CT scans I've gotten done over the years and all the sputum samples and virus testing I've done that all turned out negative. And all the months i was admitted in the hospitals over 10 times in the last 3 years and incubated twice back in August due to fainting from low oxygen levels. On top of that, i have severe Crohn's disease (inflammatory bowel disease) and really bad arthritis and many other chronic issues. No treatment has worked. I've tried almost every biologic. I'm currently on prednisone and have been on and off for the last 3 years because i just can't live without it. My chronic pain and depression has become severe since August and sometimes i wake up completely unable to move a muscle. Yet some days i wake up completely fine. I never thought my would get this bad. Especially the last 2 years my cough has been the worst but it's only really started to effect my mental health severely since August. Since I was admitted to the hospital and incubated. I am unable to cope with life like this. My life is absolutely ruined. Destroyed. And I don't know if there's a cure for it. I suffer so much on a daily basis you wouldn't believe it. I was prescribed opioids (morphine, hydromorphone and hydrocodone) to manage my chronic pain and coughing including a bunch of other non-opioids, and Ativan (lorazepam) 0.5mg to manage my anxiety and depression and panic attacks that i get very bad some days. I use these medicines in order to cope with my pain and depression. Without them my pain is unbearable and i often get panic attacks from the coughing that i struggle to breathe and feel like I'm going to faint and pass out which has happened to me in the hospital before. I do not have an addiction and I'm using them for pain management and anxiety. People with an addiction use much more then this it's not even comparable. I only take a few milligrams per day at most. Some take hundreds and even thousands. For example, my pills are 1mg 2mg hydrocodone normal release, 10mg and 5mg morphine sulfate and 3mg hydromorphone contin extended release. I only use them as needed. Some days i take 1-2 pills some days my pain is severe and i need to take more. That is on top of Tylenol i already use on a regular basis too. I used to use ibuprofen often too and still do from time to time but it's really not recommended for people with Crohn's as it makes bleeding and pain worse. So it's something i can't take often.

I've only been on opioids since August and actually only for the last 2-3 months have i been using them almost on a daily basis because of how bad my pain has gotten. Beforehand i was hardly using a few pills a few times a month.  Some days i can go without using opioids at all (chronic pain is extremely unpredictable) 

But here's my issue. Recently my doctor started refusing to provide me with refills for my meds saying that they are dangerous & concerned about addiction. & don't feel comfortable providing refills. Even the walk-in clinic I've visited refused to give me. (I can always try different clinics though and next time ask for a refill instead of a new dose, it's just that it's incredibly difficult for me to even get out of the house nowadays due to my chronic pain and lung issues. Pair that with the freezing temps of my country and i hardly get to go out) I've always had a fear of this happening but now it's become a reality. On the night of December 20th i was taken to the emergency room because i ran out of my meds and i was in agonizing pain. Even in the ER i was in agonizing pain and at one point in tears for over 12 hours before i got a high enough dose of hydromorphone that it actually helped with my pain. Literally unable to move. They kept giving me 1 tablet of 1mg normal release pill and if you know anything about Crohn's you already know people with this disease their intestines hardly absorb anything they take/eat orally. It doesn't help that in 2019 i had more than half of my large intestines removed in a surgical procedure. So that makes my absorption even worse. The 1mg pill hardly worked (at home for this type of pain i usually take at least 2mg for it to have any effect) after explaining my situation & suffering to many doctors they eventually decided to actually listen to me and switch me to 0.5mg subQ hydromorphone just like what they had previously done. That's when i finally started to experience real pain relief that actually worked. Yeah 0.5mg might seem like a significantly lower dose then 1mg oral but the thing you have to understand is that when almost any drug is given by subQ or intravenously it is a lot more potent and especially with the absorption issues of my intestines because of severe inflammation, that's why it works a lot better. Due to all the above, suddenly even 0.5mg becomes like 3mg oral hydromorphone equivalent.

I'm getting discharged today on Christmas Eve on the 25th. I was supposed to see a pain management doctor or that's what i was made to believe until he came in and introduced himself as a substance addiction doctor. He suggested that i start Suboxone but after reading about people's experience with it I'm not convinced I'm ready to start it now.

According to him, it's supposed to help with chronic pain and anxiety. But from what I've read about people's experience (and i read for hours) it doesn't affect severe chronic pain well. Also the way this medication works is that it basically kicks out any opioids in your body and replaces itself with it. So if i was to start it and it didn't work well enough to manage my pain, i would have to take a significantly higher dose of opioids for them to work normally again. Just as an example instead of taking 2mg i may have to take 8+mg or even possibly more.

Some people also mentioned how it made their depression and anxiety worse and how it can be impossible to quit it. I really don't want to get hooked on a drug that may not work for me. 

I cannot believe somebody who's only been on a few milligrams of opioids for less than 2 months to treat chronic pain is being treated as a complete addict. I am completely disgusted. I was made to believe multiple times that i was specifically seeing a pain doctor but i was lied to and it ended up being an addictions doctor.

I was given 28 2mg pills to go home with from the normal doctor and i was instructed to follow up with the ""addictions doctor"" to further manage my pain. I plan on telling him i don't feel comfortable to start the Suboxone at this point in time.

I would love to know your thoughts on this & if anyone has any suggestions. I'm open to all suggestions i can get at this point to be honest.",1767171174.0,3,36,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1q081q3,First Arthritis flareup (need help/recommendations!),"My mother is 67 and recently diagnosed with osteoarthritis in her right knee. She has had pain for around 3 months, and the knee looks quite swollen in comparison to the left knee. She has no cracking/crepitus, but excruciating pain throughout the days sometimes, as if it feels like someone is constantly hitting her knee with a hammer. The pain has been there for around 9 weeks, and just gotten worse as she twisted it again within the last month. She says it sometimes feels stiffer in the morning, she can extend her knee straight, but not side to side, and sometimes her elbow joints are tender also. The pain is constant, not flaring up or down, but 24/7 always there.

1q050yh,Anyone else with thermal allodynia or sensitised nerves due to trauma?,"I've been searching and reading many different sources of information since what I have seems to come from post traumatic orofacial injury. I had an object dropped on my face, it made contact with my incisor and but did not kill the nerve. Two months later I have the worst winter with thermal allodynia, painful sensations from non painful stimulus, from drafts, breezy air, cold temperatures, and differences in temperatures. It's on the side the tooth was hit however the areas on my face where I have symptoms change all the time. Sometimes it's worse in my eye socket, sometimes it's my sinus area, sometimes my forehead, sometimes scalp. It's at the point where I can't even be in air-conditioning, and I can't sleep when the temperature outside is cold and high humidity. I've become even more suicidal because I am almost always in some level of discomfort. It's now been since May with no improvement. 



My doctor wrote it off as trigimenal neuralgia which it definitely does not feel like. My pain is not sharp, it's an uncomfortable sensation. Like ice in my skin. When I breathe my sinuses feel cold and that travels into my throat. The one neurologist I was referred to has an 8 month wait list so has not taken me on.

1q04idy,Any find that generic Hydrocodone brands differ from each other.,"After a Decade of suffering (I'm 64) and being bedridden 70%of the time, I found a Pain Management Dr who prescribes Hydrocodone. 
I'm Opiod Naive so I have no tolerance.  I've had surgeries but no long term prescriptions.
When I had surgeries,  I was prone to side effects of pain meds and a small dose was effective.  For example I had a Bowel Resection in my 40s and Percocet was to strong. I threw up the 1st pill  though I'd eaten. I asked for a low dose of Hydrocodone.  
In regards to my question, I was absolutely shocked when 5mg ×4 a day didn't touch my back pain.
Spinal Stenosis,  Bulging discs, spine is twisted making one hip hoger than the other. DDD, next to no cartilage L4 L5 and L6 left me bedridden most of the time with a Care-Giver who still takes care of most everything. 
After a year in Pain  Management (My Dr. has a nasty demeanor) I asked for a dose increase.  I'm unable to sit and spend the majority of my day laying on my Stomach rotating heat and ice.Health issues are piling up. I've needed Hernia surgery for 2 Years but being able to sit like a Human precludes this. I got the dose increase and was able to begin walking with a walker up to 30 minutes a day. I could sit (muscle spasms were a huge problem and Baclefon alone wasn't enough)
for 3 hours a day and that was huge. My muscles have visibly atrophied.  
That was last month.  I got my 2nd prescription yesterday and it was a different generic brand. I don't what kind but looked different.  No way on God's green earth are these truly 7.5 mg. I feel exactly like I did on 5mg which I suspected weren't actually 5mg. I'd researched generics and much to my dismay they have a range from 80%-125% for FDA approval. Also more than one reputable article pointed out the FDA can't regulate as well prescriptions that come from other countries. 
I had this experience with Baclefon.  I switched to Walmart and there 20mg felt like 10.My Nurse Practitioner (My regular provider) said she didn't believe that all generics were not the same regarding effectiveness until it happened to her.
I'm hoping it's all in my head about the new prescription (Different generic) but the fact is I've been in bed most all day. At 64 after a Decade of Hell and being isolated from humanity ,I had hope that I could finally get the surgery I need. I also need to go back to the Cardiologist to see if I need stents. Let alone just be able to visit with my Nieghbors and live the last years of my life with managed pain. I can't go back to living in total Hell. Is it true? Has anybody experienced a generic they know is B.S. and the company is cheating or only 80% of active medicine.  Imo this is criminal. I had hope last month now I have none.Also I'm not getting the side effects from this month's generics.  I just hurt! Slight relief for a couple of hours.  I'm absolutely sick.

Im day 8 of a cold turkey off it. Feel like i was living in a fog. My pain levels havent changed either. Very bizare.

I find IBUROFEN far more effective for MY pain. But how much can i take every day? Worried about long term effects? Im on 400mg-600mg per day. But dont know how long i can sustain this.

It will be open heart, tissue valve as the surgeon said when going through my notes I have alot of back surgeries in my future. Really? Thats news to me. Saw a neurosurgeon awhile back and he mentioned a discetomy at my C5-6  area due to loss of csf signal but never mentioned any other area of my back. I do have several issues in my cervical, thoracic and lumbar areas but he never even brought those up. He told me he would do his best to add 10-15yrs onto my life versus the 1 maybe 2 I ha e without surgery as I am symptomatic. He also only discussed treating my pain for 2 weeks, with a total of 8 week recovery time. I wanted to throw up the entire time I was there. He's maybe, MAYBE close to my age, seemed kind, but said my pain issues were best addressed by a different doctor. This whole hospital/clinic is/ has been a nightmare for me!

Not sure if I can mention this so hopefully mods dont reem me for this but....My daughter works for this healthcare network, same hospital different location.

1pztpo7,"I’ve been stuck in a pain flare for a month now, and I am hopeless at this point","I have zero prescribed pain meds. Docs in my area refuse to give them for chronic pain. I typically use mj for flare ups, but even that isn’t touching my pain. For reference, I have had a constant chronic migraine for close to a decade now. I also have suspected EDS and PCOS, as well as chronic back pain from a failed spinal tap years ago. I’m on the spectrum as well, so overstimulation was already an issue before I got sick. 

I wake up every single day with a “hangover” feeling. Whether I get 6 hours of sleep or 12, I’m exhausted and feel so foggy. My eyes hurt so badly, and my jaw (forgot to mention, I have pretty bad TMJ as well), sinuses, and head are all hurting so much that I can’t function. My energy is GONE, and I’m so tired of it. I have so much I need to be doing around the house but have no energy or focus for any of it. My back has been spasming every. Single. Day. And I don’t understand why because I haven’t even been bending much? I sleep on a heating pad to help, but I cannot seem to get comfortable at all. 

I feel almost feverish daily, and there’s literally no reason I should be feeling this way. I don’t have a cold or an actual fever. I know some of it is my seasonal depression kicking into full gear, but that shouldn’t cause me to feel like I have the flu? I’m SO overstimulated ALL the time by absolutely everyone and everything. Scents that are usually fine for me are nauseating. Foods that are usually “safe” to me make me want to puke. I get so hungry, eat 3 bites of food, and am suddenly “done” and icked out. Then I get hungry again half an hour later. 

I’m feeling so incredibly hopeless right now. I have to go back to work on the 5th, and I don’t know how I’m supposed to do that. I’m taking all of my meds, trying to get lots of sleep, and doing what I can to stay alive. But I am so tired. I’m so tired of being in blinding pain all the time. Last time I went to the ER, the doctor was incredibly dismissive and ended up making my pain flare WORSE because he didn’t give me the proper meds in my infusion. He literally just gave me otc meds plus a nausea medicine. That plus years of medical trauma has left me scared to go back. I can’t even imagine this flare getting worse. I’ve tried all my normal tools, and nothing is working. ",1767128636.0,7,18,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1pzt7dv,"Chronic low back pain for a year, clean scans… this feels like a mystery that needs detective work","Alright, I’m posting because I know chronic pain messes with your head and makes everyone feel like their case is unique or hopeless, but this has crossed that line for me. The way this pain behaves just doesn’t make sense, and I’m out of ideas.

I’m a 25 year old guy and I’ve been dealing with constant low back pain for a full year now. It started after a gym injury. I was doing leg raises lying on my back and on one rep I felt a sharp pinch, almost like an electric pain in my lower back. I immediately thought “something just happened.” I didn’t collapse, I could still move fine, but I stopped the workout and went home. I showered, tried to cool down, and from that moment on the pain showed up and never went away.

Since then it’s been there 24/7. No sciatica, no leg pain, no numbness, no tingling. Just axial low back pain. Most of the time it feels diffuse across my entire lower back, but it often leans more to the left side, and I also get pain in the upper glute area.

Here’s where it gets weird. The pain is always there 24/7, but it clearly gets worse when I lie down and actually rest my back, especially when it’s fully supported. The moment I try to relax and let go, the pain ramps up hard at least for 10/15 minutes. Lying on my stomach can also trigger it. That part feels consistent, but everything else is harder to pin down.

When it comes to movement, nothing fits a clean textbook pattern. Flexion sometimes makes it slightly worse, but nothing dramatic like you’d expect with a disc herniation. Extension has also caused pain at times, but it’s vague and inconsistent. Overall it feels diffuse, which makes it hard to say “this is clearly mechanical X or Y.”

I’ve had pretty much everything checked. CT scans, ultrasounds, MRIs of my full spine and hips, MRI of the sacrum. SI joints look fine. Blood work came back negative for autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. I’ve had multiple doctors and specialists look at all of this and no one sees anything structurally wrong. I even did facet joint diagnostic injections and they did absolutely nothing. The only thing I know for sure is that this constant chronic pain started right after that bad movement at the gym.

Living like this has taken a massive toll on me. I lost my job. I lost the girl I was seeing. My social life basically disappeared. There is no position and no moment of the day where I feel comfortable in my own body. I’m never at ease. I don’t function like a normal human being anymore. It’s hard to concentrate even to watch a movie, let alone work. Every action, even small things like making breakfast, takes a huge amount of effort. It honestly feels like being stuck in hell inside your own body.

Sleep is also really hard. With sleeping pills I can usually get through the night, but if I wake up to go to the bathroom, the pain is immediately there. No reset, no relief. It’s just waiting for me.

The mental side has been brutal. The brain fog from living in constant pain is intense. My nervous system feels fried. Concentration, memory, motivation, everything takes a hit. I’ve had suicidal thoughts during this year, not because I want to die, but because living like this feels unbearable at times. Chronic pain really messes with your head in ways people don’t understand unless they’ve lived it.

I’ve tried pretty much everything to fix this. Physical therapy multiple times with different people, stretching, mobility work, strengthening, massage, heat, rest, different diets, injections. I’ve used a TENS unit, tried chiropractic, acupuncture and all kinds of alternative therapies you can imagine. I even spent time just floating in a pool to see if the tension would calm down. Spoiler: it didn’t.

Medication wise, I’ve tried pregabalin, gabapentin, and duloxetine and none of them helped at all. I even tried tapentadol recently, an opioid, and still nothing. That’s what really messes with my head. Does it make sense that nothing works because this is some kind of chronic tension in the deep muscles of my lower back? It doesn’t really feel inflammatory. If it were, the steroid injections should have helped at least a bit. I even did a gut reset for a month (basically an anti inflammatory diet) and felt absolutely no difference at all.

I also went deep into the mind-body and TMS rabbit hole. I read The Way Out by Alan Gordon, learned about Sarno, did meditation, journaling, somatic work, nervous system calming approaches. I don’t dismiss that angle at all, especially after living like this for a year. I can clearly feel that this pain has left some kind of brain imprint. But at the same time, when I lie down and rest my back and the pain explodes, it’s hard not to think that something physical has to be happening too.

I read that McGill article where he says “non-specific low back pain” basically doesn’t exist and that when doctors use that label, it often means the patient hasn’t been properly evaluated. I’ve seen multiple PTs and honestly none of them really know what’s going on with me. Some blame tight hip flexors, others say central sensitization or nociplastic pain. Everyone has a theory, no one has answers.

At this point I don’t even care what the exact diagnosis is anymore. I just want a way forward. Right now my plan is to fully commit to the Low Back Ability program and do it consistently every day for at least six months and see what happens. I like his approach of slowly building evidence and capacity over time. It makes sense to me from a neuroplasticity point of view too. If my nervous system is stuck in this constant danger mode, maybe gradually rebuilding trust and confidence in my back with very controlled movements at first, and then progressively building real strength, is the only way out. I’m not sure tbh, but It’s worth a shot.

I’m exhausted, fed up, and tired of living like this, but I’m still trying to understand what the hell is going on. If anyone has dealt with something similar, pain that’s constant but worsens when you rest your back, clean scans, and no clear answers, I’d really appreciate hearing what helped or where you’d look next.

I didn't get pass the tiny start up dose, as I just walked around (unsteadily) in a dizzy daze for a week, then broke out with a heavy rash and fever.

So I was a bit nervous starting Lyrica, but started in hospital, and while on a corticosteroids treatment (finished that treatment a couple of weeks ago). I got sleepy, dizzy and dazed for a few days at start-up, and everytime I upped the dosage according to the doctors plan. But the side effects calmed surprisingly fast every time, like a couple of days. Only persisting side effects has been serious cottonmouth, and a slight headache like feeling, and more dizzy spells than usual, along with a little bit of a daze now and then.
It has now been 6 days since I upped for the last time, from 50mg twice a day, to 75mg twice a day, in the morning and before bed. And I am sleeping insane amounts!

My partner has to wake me up so I'll take the rest of my medications at the right times, and it takes him half an houre to get me awake enough to swallow my pills. I slur my words so he can't understand anything, and yesterday he had to implement the whole ""squeeze my hand if you hear what I'm saying"" thing, cause I'm just out. I think during the last 48 hours I've been properly awake (even then a bit dazed and dizzy) for maby 6 hours. Tried to force myself to get out of bed earlier today, and managed to sit up, but fell back asleep sitting, with my head in an awkward angle. 
So I'm not really getting enough food and water either. And the headaches are becoming insane.

1pzk6b7,Vent (advice needed please),"I have POTS so bad my cardiologist added Dysautonomia to my chart rather than POTS as I overqualified for POTS and have a lot of other issues with my autonomic nervous system. I’ve also had insomnia my whole life but it’s mainly due to my psychiatric disabilities which I don’t share much here. I haven’t slept properly in 9 weeks now I’m talking it taking 5 plus hours to get to sleep and waking up in pain every other hour. It got to the point where I am hallucinating because of the sleep deprivation and pain (note none of my psychiatric conditions have hallucinations as a symptom or have any correlation with increased risk of hallucinations). The only sleep I’ve gotten was with self medicating with an unhealthy amount of caffeine or taking every over the counter pain medication possible. I know I’m lucky that the edge of my pain can be taken away with OTC meds but the issue is that I’m constantly needing more than I can have without developing resistance which I really don’t want. I don’t know what to do as I’ve been gaslight for years about my condition and pain and no one listens to me as my parents still have to take care of me due to my health and disabilities, along with my psych issues and history. I’ve never abused meds before but for some reason no one listened about the pain and it took years of fighting and countless GPs to get a cardiologist referred to me (luckily he is amazing and I got the diagnosis from testing I did before seeing him so it only took one appointment and he never gaslight me). But for some reason doctors always ignore the pain. 10 weeks ago my baseline was around a 3 which for me meant I didn’t notice it but it was still there and draining, but then I went on a camping trip and my baseline was a 6 meaning all I could think about was the pain and I was struggling to breathe, eat and sleep. The pain would get so bad I would pass out in agony with my pain reaching a 9 which to me means pain so bad I become unconscious and screaming/ shaking in agony. Since then my pain hasn’t gone back to a three and I now have a baseline at 5. I can’t sleep or do anything or think of anything but the pain without a good high intensity distraction. But my type of pain is whole body aches and is dull rather than sharp so the main issue isn’t the pain itself it’s the fatigue and other symptoms that come with the pain. I guess I’m just alone and scared. I don’t want to be reliant on meds but I can’t sleep without paracetamol at least. Not to meantion the chronic migraines. The point is I’m just overwhelmed and scared because I don’t know what to do anymore because OTC meds aren’t a long term solution. I miss my old life before the pain and fatigue. The worst part isn’t the agony it’s trying to pretend I’m not constantly in pain and wishing I could be in bed resting. I wanna play guitar and draw and paint but I don’t have the energy or time. I just want some help or advice on what to do ig as I can’t sleep or function anymore cos of the pain and fatigue it causes.

Went to go pickup in refill day and CVS claimed they were entirely out of stock and  ordered it that morning  but couldn't get supply truck come til next day not sure what time .So asked if could get at least two pills to have until then and she said there was absolutely none in the building to give .  So why didn't they fill it when they got the script three days before when they had plenty in stock ? Then they could of  let it sit and wait for me to pick up on refill due date  ? . I mean that is the whole point of doctor sending the script in few days early . So was told I could go to another pharmacy but doctor would have to send over a whole new script . I called doctor and he was very understanding and irritated with cvs and sent out a script to the nearby local pharmacy which doesn't take my insurance but at this point I was grateful and didn't care about out of pocket expense .So anyone else have any issues with CVS like this ?

1pzk2xc,Post-surgery pain meds,"This is the first time I've remembered to make sure I have adequate pain control/pain meds called in prior to my surgery (spinal cord stimulator removal). It's caused so much pain and discomfort and helped none and only added to my baseline.

I'm currently on Belbuca 150mcg 2x/day, and it doesn't help much, but it's more than anything else has thus far. I want to know how I go about asking for pain meds for post-surgery without sounding directly like an addict.

My pain management doctor tried me on oxy, hydro, and tramadol in the past at 5mg max and they didn't help, however he never tried a dosage increase and I feel that it'd be worth trying post-surgery but I really don't know how to ask without literally calling them and asking for a good supply of 10mg of pain medication.

I'm willing to cancel the surgery since it's elective but I'd still rather get it out. I just want adequate pain control just for the surgery pain since the baseline pain is already hell and I'm already pissed that a doctor duped me into getting this battery implanted in the first place. 

My mom suggested asking my pain management doctor to manage the surgery pain, however I'm weary of putting any amount of strain on that relationship which shouldn't even be required if the surgeon does his job, given my pain management doctor is already sticking his neck out prescribing me the Belbuca.

I’m 32F surgically diagnosed with endometriosis and suspected Ehler’s Danlos syndrome and MCAS. Other than the surgery for endometriosis, which only resolved my pain for 3 months, I’ve been treating myself for these other conditions. The medical community can’t see these invisible illnesses on me and I am fighting tooth and nail to get them “proven.”

With that being said, I cannot relate to healthy normal people anymore. I never really could to begin with, but now, all my capable friends who are out there working hard and living exciting lives.. have all dropped me on my ass completely.

I sit at home all day just trying to do the bare minimum like feed myself and take care of my hygiene, grocery shopping and errands.. all of those things alone exhaust me beyond words. I’m single, alone and living in a studio. No pets because I can’t care for them. My parents live 10mins away from me and I spend more time with them than anyone. And they are not the best people to be around, because much like the medical community, they also don’t believe I’m as sick as I am.

I had a good friendship with another disabled woman a few years ago and long story short, that friendship blew up completely and we aren’t friends anymore. She’s not a good person and I don’t want her in my life, but I’m so reminiscent on how understanding we were of each other and how supportive it all felt. It breaks my heart to not have anyone like her in my life now.

But I don’t know where to turn to next. I’m behind on everything I was supposed to do for disability or unemployment because I literally can’t focus on or do these complicated forms and stuff alone. I need advocates and I need to be part of a disability community somehow. I’ve gone to the local offices and asked for help and they only help so much. I told them I wouldn’t be able to fill out anything on my own and that I need help. But everyone thinks I’m a crazy looney tune for needing help. Because “I look fine”

I need to be around people with real disability struggles and form connections with people who are like me, in real life. Yet here I am, alone, struggling, barely able to do anything, confused, hurting, in pain, crying constantly.. and I have no idea where to turn to.

1pzhzw5,Anyone have experience with this?,"I went to a doctor because at the beginning of this year I found out having throbbing pain everywhere anywhere at any time of the day in multiple parts of your body is apparently not normal.

I started keeping a pain journal that I would compile at school, with a drawing of a human so I could color where the pain was and say at what hours it happened. kinda childish, and many times one drawing wasn't enough for those 6 hours at school but it was ok for my needs. 

upon going to the doctor he saw my pain journal and said, ""hm, it's chronic, makes you think of fibromyalgia"" hm ok. then he did a physical test and he arrived at the conclusion it's from inactivity (muscle atrophy causes this kind of pain apparently) and that exercising should alleviate it. I find it kinda weird because I've had it since I was around 6 years old and I wasn't inactive at that time I think. and I used to exercise but the pain didn't change, as brief as that was.

anyway I'll try exercising from now on. I researched about it and I found some research saying that inactivity can cause chronic pain in mice, but just a certain kind (can't find the name now).

1pzgte2,Tips to decrease fear/expectancy of pain?,"So I’ve always believed something is physically wrong with my back, but I’ve had my issue for 8 years now, and I’ve tried everything. It started from weightlifting but it never went away. I got surgery and it made it much worse, what I would do to go back to the point where I was still in pain but at least could stand for more than 20 mins. 

At the start I was very dismissive of any psychological reasons for my pain because I had no mental health issues before the pain. But now the pain has increased my anxiety and led to more issues (eating disorder, social anxiety, hard to pay attention when in pain). I know constant pain can reinforce the pain pathways, and though it feels SO PHYSICAL, the evidence for mindfulness and other stuff makes me think the anxiety and expectancy of the pain is making it worse for me. Like I have thought about if god just told me “you have no physical problem, it is your mind now”, I wonder if my pain and fear would just slowly go away.

The years I’ve spent in my concentration I have battled what seems to be chronic pain. It is proven positive as sciatica and is also leading to comorbid autoimmune issues. It has made working, learning, and living hard so I haven’t gotten out of my undergrad what others have which is bad in a competitive field. Also the job market sucks. I left both my prior jobs due to harassment and a desire to gather more skills, the other due to toxicity and my inability to meet requirements, and pulled out of applying for a dream job because I don’t see my circumstances getting any better in the forseeable future. I had life savings to move out and pay some debt off but has gone down the drain in the form of copay and an almost compulsive desire to relieve the pain I’ve experienced. I’m scared about the “new normal” of living with this condition and fear the impact medication and accommodation will have on my body, confidence, and reliability. I am honestly a burden to everyone around me and they deny it but I know the absolute truth because I live with it. How do I go forward?

1pz040i,Anyone have experience with Duloxetine or any other medications that genuinely helped?,"Hi I’m 18 F and I’ve had chronic pain for two years now. It’s currently one of those rlly bad days with the hot, sharp, tense consistent muscle pain. I’ve been told by my current doctor that I have a high possibility of fibromyalgia & Central sensitization syndrome which I agree with. 

She recently recommended Duloxetine for me with is an SNRI that is specifically for pain like mine releasing both norepinephrine and serotonin to reduce physical pain and anxiety (I have OCD and GAD). I told her that I wanted to continue to try therapy, PT, and see a rheumatologist before making a decision like this but I don’t know. 

Doctors will often recommend SNRI while family/parents are strongly against it so I want a second to just think for myself. I only feel pressure from family honestly but every pain medication and migraine medication that I have tried does nothing, it doesn’t even soothe the pain. 

The pain I have originally started when I was 16 and it was just persistent migraines but it’s evolved and gotten worse. It’s always there everyday (maybe once in a blue moon it won’t be there) but the only change is HOW MUCH it hurts. Today is a 10/10 but tmrw could be a 3/10 making it more bearable but it is always. there. 

I’ve been doing my own research to learn about SSRI and the difference between those and SNRI and look into others personal experiences and what it does exactly when it enters my body and also the side effects. 

I’ve seen a lot of people say that it is the best thing that they’ve ever had and once the common side effects go away (e.g. dry mouth, nausea, headaches) it’s great. I’ve also seen the other side of people who have had the Duloxetine and were faced with the rare side effects (e.g. thyroid damage) and now have another layer of long term issues to worry about — I just don’t know how my body will react to it. 

This is a tough decision for me and I want to take my time to think it through but I feel like I am doing all the “right things” like asking for help, taking breaks, going to therapy, going to the doctors, looking for solutions but I’m so tired and I’m in so much pain. 

Is there a possible alternative? Do any of you have experience with Duloxetine (or any other SNRI?). Do any of you have a similar condition to mine and how are u dealing with it/how have u dealt with it?

I'm grateful I get to have a rehab facility sort of near me, and a very caring primary nurse who is very understanding, but holy shit, I know I'm going to feel worse after for a while, which makes it super hard to like working out.

So often I've been told that if I started working out eventually I'd learn to love it, it's been months of rehab and at home workouts and I still hate it. I do it for the health benefits and that's it. 

I guess I'm just tired of being told it'll stop hurting eventually because it probably won't. And it's insulting that people keep saying it when it's not true.

I was on around 60 mg of Percocet 5/325 for 9 months. After my successful fusion on november 11, my neurosurgeon tapered me down 25% a week until like 11 days ago. My last script was for 15 mg a day, spread out throughout the day. I realized I didn't need them for pain anymore, and that ibuprofen and acetaminophen were working to mostly fight off the remaining pains. I told my neurosurgeon that, and he immediately stopped prescribing me any Percocets, and told me to get in contact with my PCP. 
  
Unfortunately, it's not that simple. I'm a complicated patient and have been on 4+ mg of Klonopin for like years due to my aggressive anxiety, and have been on an SNRI for almost 20 years.. I have called my psychiatrist with in-depth notes about what I am taking now, what my symptoms are, and if she can help me. 
  
I'm having severe twitching, pain, muscle spasms, diarrhea, and the most wiggly/restless arms and legs at night ever. I can't sleep until the sun comes up. I have even more serious anxiety than I did before, major mood swings, I'm freezing 
  
I took my last full 15 mg of Percocet on Thursday. I'm freezing cold, constantly sobbing, and taking way more of my Klonopin than I should be.

And since symptoms can be widespread and inconsistent, TMJ is sometimes overlooked or misattributed, which can make the pain cycle even more frustrating. However, understanding how jaw alignment and muscle strain affect the rest of the body can be an important step for people who’ve been dealing with persistent discomfort without clear answers.

My DXs are more severe than i thought they were/could be, i kept thinking the pain was coming from something else until it dawned on me duh your conditions ARE the problem, and you have MULTIPLE OVERLAPPING pain! & being undertreated is causing my flares to become way more constant & i dont know how to handle being undertreated, what i do know is i cant go through more of these severe flares, i just cant, they are way too strong/scary.

I’ve been referred to as a PM&R / physiatrist and I’m excited for my appointment, it seems interesting. I’ve had back pain for 8 years, just got diagnosed with cervical spondylitis and waiting for more exams. I’ve had success with physiotherapy, orthopedic insoles, and currently seeing an orthoptist.

I’m wondering what your experience has been with a PM&R Dr / physiatrist.

Also, since I have some time before the appointment, I’ve been making notes about what hurts, since when, what helps and doesn’t, what day to day tasks I find difficult (aka how the pain affects my life), what other professionals I see. I figure this can save time at the appointment. I’m wondering if there is any other type of info I should reflect on beforehand to make it a smoother process, or anything else they’ll likely want to know?

1pych55,Barometric Pressure &Pain Part 1: Maine vs Florida,"I live in Maine and have a laundry list of health problems, including violent arthritis, and degenerative disc disease. I am miserable every winter and it's just getting worse.

Walking a mile, even in  summer here, s$cks. It's awful. I exercise 1-2 hours a week in the winter. I hardly leave the house for 4 months. I hate my life here and am barely hanging on. 

According to one blog I found online, Maine has more barometric pressure swings than anywhere else in the country.  I am collecting data to figure out more. Anecdotally, this matches my experience. 

You do not need to have a storm for the pressure to change. Five spikes and drops on a clear day in Maine isn't unusual. 

I traveled to St Pete for 5 weeks this March to visit family. My arthritis wasn't bad at all. I walked an average of 3 miles a day. I walked the pier back and forth 5 times a week. My longest was 8 miles in a single day and I felt great! It was a miracle. 

Every day I dream of moving to Florida, only because I think i would have a better existence. I cry every day I look outside and see snow and I'm a 54 year old man. 

So I'm wondering Floridians with arthritis, what it up with this?
Is the summer or fall more painful? 
Does the high heat cause you issues?
I assume hurricanes are awful but what about passing storms?
Did you leave the Northeast and find a less painful, more fulfilling life?
What else can you tell me?",1766982237.0,1,2,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1pycd1r,Rant about breathing problems,"This is long and it’s very likely that no one will read this. Just venting. 

In December of 2020 I lost the ability to breathe deeply. I still have no idea why. 

Also whenever I swallowed it felt like I was getting stabbed in between the shoulder blades, and I lost all sense of pressure in my esophagus. Food would immediately come back up. I also had really bad left shoulder pain. It felt like air was moving differently in my body. I also looked down and noticed that when I tried to breathe, neither my chest nor my belly was expanding. 

I went to the ER about 19 days into it because I had stopped eating because I was so scared. My resting HR was 135 (it remains that high to this day) and my BP was 145/95, which was wildly uncharacteristic for me. I had always had perfect blood pressure for my entire life, and just a week before my symptoms started my HR at the doctor was 77 and my BP was 113/80.

They did an x-ray and couldn’t find anything at that ER visit aside from the tachycardia, which they attributed to anxiety, and sent me home. 

About two weeks later I developed bad chest pain. I went back to the ER thinking it would be nothing but it turned out I had some kind of infection/inflammatory nodule in my left lung which they were calling pneumonia, but they couldn’t confirm it. Also my left lung had collapsed and I had a pleural effusion. 

They gave me antibiotics for the pneumonia and asked me to get another CT scan in 6 weeks. I waited about 4 months to do it and the nodule had shrunk in size, so they just said “probably infectious or inflammatory” and sent me home with no additional information. 

By this point I had started eating again, but it was ridiculously painful in my back. It felt like my entire thoracic spine was being vacuumed/pulled forward and down every time I ate. And the fascia in my back was getting dragged through itself. It was awful. It kept my heart rate high and prevented me from being able to breathe deeply. I passed a PFT though so there was nothing they could do for me. I could literally hear the tissue snapping around my ribs it was being pulled so tight. It felt like my GI tract was constantly pulling on my thoracic spine. 

The other thing is I have not changed my eating at all but I’ve gained an enormous amount of weight — 80lbs. And this was over the course of 6 months. I told the cardiologist this and asked her if rapid weight gain is associated with heart problems, and she said yes, but it’s typically edema in the legs and I didn’t have that. 

I then went to a pain doctor and he did an ultrasound on my chest. I found out that my breathing muscles were in fact getting pulled forward when I ate because they all had split tearing in them. Other doctors do not take PM&R ultrasounds seriously though. 

My only theories are extremely unlikely. I was convinced for a while that I had a micro perforation in my esophagus because this happened after I had eaten a large meal that day in December 2020. I thought that would it was hiding from imaging because they never used oral contrast with me. But all the literature (and doctors) have made it very clear that a perforation, no matter how small, turns into sepsis and becomes fatal quickly.

My next theory is also unlikely. It feels my intercostal muscles are not contracting but my diaphragm is. This almost never happens outside of a spinal cord injury, but immediately before my symptoms started someone had really forcibly twisted my left arm and entire torso the wrong way, so I wondered if they had damaged my intercostal nerves.

There is no EMG for intercostal nerves so there’s no way to test for it. I just know that my chest doesn’t expand when I breathe. But the circumference of my chest has grown ridiculously — from 36 inches to 48 inches, so I feel like that increased my lung size and capacity. 

This is just a rant, I’m not looking for answers. I’m just frustrated because I know that something is seriously wrong and yet I have nothing to actually call it. “Breathing/heart rate problem that has caused me to be obese.” Most doctors will not listen to me because I’ve had so many tests.

TBH I don’t understand how this could not be some sort of perforation or fistula that is not showing up on imaging. I got an infection. I still have small levels of infection markers in my blood but don’t have a full blown infection. My  chest cavity and my esophagus are fighting and yanking on each other. 

By the way I have zero psychiatric history and zero history of psychosomatic pain or hallucinations. So respectfully, please do not suggest this in the comments.

1pya1lk,Can you guys leave me some nice comments please?,"I’m tired, I’m really tired. I’m trying so hard to keep going but it’s frankly exhausting to live like this. I’ve got fibromyalgia and my parents think I’m crazy, they find my disability embarrassing and a nuisance. They won’t listen to me when I tell them not to touch me when I’m in pain, they restrict my pain meds ( even though they don’t work half the time anyways ), and they try and correct me and silence me I tell them about MY body.
Most of my friends just feel pity for me, or constantly forget that I’m disabled and just accidentally leave me behind when I need assistance. They shame me for drinking too, and I know it’s bad for me, but I’d rather drink than lose my mind to the pain. 
I’m trying to hold on. They’re not cruel people, they just don’t live with chronic pain. They hear me recount my agony, and just feel glad they don’t have to go through what I do.

I like to think I’m a positive person. It’s just hard to stay sane when you’re always in debilitating pain. My partner can’t hold me when I need it most, he has to take care of me all the time, he has to watch me suffer. I feel bad because I know it takes a toll on him to not be able to help.
My best friend is always supporting me, and he’s so understanding but the pain is taking me out. Today I was on the phone to him for nine hours, and for like a good two or three hours I just screamed and cried, and I was literally sweating from pain the whole time and unable to move, just wondering when all this will stop.
He’s the best by the way, he makes me feel so much less alone.

1py8ytp,Mua update,"So I had a phone call with the mua doc about that procedure. And the first thing he tells me is the internet and even the pamphlet is misleading as hell. He said its not a rigorous chiropractic adjustment, like it says. But that its just a series of stretches within the normal human range of comfortability. He said even if it doesnt feel like I have a decrease range in motion, the severe pain in the base of my head/top of spine/neck says otherwise. 

He told me its done with a chiropractic doctor, orthopedic doctors/surgeons, an anesthesiologist to closely monitor everything, the doctor who is doing the stretches and in my case, one of the ""experts in this field"" will be there, too. He told me it only lasts about 15 minutes, tops and is nothing forceful or hard on the body and that while its proprofol, its light enough that most people start waking up by the time they're finishing and I'll go home like 30 minutes later.

I did mention that while ive never been diagnosed with EDS, I do have hypermobility and asked about possible injury because of it. He said the stretches wont be within my extended range because of being hypermobile, but won't go beyond a certain range (I can't remember what it was he said) and if I were awake and able to be 100% relaxed, it still wouldn't hurt, if that makes sense. He said he does about 30 a month and everyone he's done has said that they've gone from a level 7/8 to like a 2 once they complete the physical therapy for a few weeks after. He said the risk of additional injury is very low but like all ""procedures"", there are risks, obviously. 

He showed me a video of what's done and it does make me feel a lot better to see its just some basic back and forth stretching with no pulling or popping. So, I at the least agreed to have a more in depth consultation on the 5th and then to decide from there. 

Do you guys think its worth it, if there is a chance of relief.?

1py3ruz,From Chronic Pain to Normal Life: How Braces Ruined My Life,"I have never shared my health story/journey on a public platform like this, but I am doing so in hopes that this heals someone else. 

I got braces in 9th grade and had them removed during my senior year of high school. It was so long ago that I don’t remember exactly when my health issues began, but sometime during those years I started experiencing severe stomach pain. The cramps were so intense that I would get tunnel vision and nearly black out.

Over several years, my doctor ran countless tests. Every single one came back showing that I was perfectly healthy. Despite that, the pain continued to worsen. By my senior year, mornings were unbearable. I had to drop my first block class because I would wake up with excruciating stomach pain and relentless diarrhea, running to the bathroom up to ten times each morning. It was absolutely awful and completely disrupted my daily life.

One weekend during college, I went camping with my parents—and for the first time in as long as I could remember, I felt normal. I woke up, ate breakfast, and even went fishing on a boat on the lake—something I would normally never do because I always needed quick access to a bathroom. My stomach didn’t hurt at all that entire weekend.

That experience stuck with me. I replayed everything in my mind—what I ate, what I didn’t eat, what I did differently, what stayed the same. Then it hit me: I had forgotten my retainers at home and hadn’t slept with them all weekend.

I immediately started researching and found a woman who had written about severe gastrointestinal issues caused by her body reacting to the metal in her orthodontic appliances. It all suddenly made sense. I ordered plastic retainers with no metal and threw my metal retainers in the trash. With the help of probiotics and eliminating metal from my mouth, I finally began living a normal life.
My orthodontist (Dr. Butterfoss in Hampton, Va) basically told me I was absolutely crazy and insisted there was no possible connection. But I didn’t need his agreement—my body proved the truth. I was finally healthy again.

Later in life, I did experience additional gastrointestinal issues. I’m now 32, and through careful tracking and an elimination diet, I was able to identify food allergies and sensitivities. I never had these issues prior to braces and retainers, but with the right adjustments, I can live a normal life and work a nohash tags?

Food allergies:
Corn
Peanuts
Tree nuts
Carrots
Oats
Peppers (skin)

Food sensitivities:
Gluten

This journey taught me to trust my body, even when medical explanations fall short. I am living proof that listening to your own experience matters.

1py3kik,Is anyone else with severe pain /nerve pain at end of their rope? I hate how this is a taboo to even talk about,"This is more like a vent because I have nowhere else to talk about this. I have told doctors that my pain will kill me, and they look at me like I am stupid or exaggerating. In their minds, and they have said this to me, there is no way pain can kill you, and chronic pain rarely sends someone into shock. What they do not understand is that the pain has killed my soul. The stress has probably caused an autoimmune disease. Maybe even cancer is forming. But when I try to explain this, they get a cold look in their eyes and change their approach, like I am a mouse and they want to corner me. They start asking questions about whether I am suicidal or if I have plans.

What is ridiculous is that they do not care. What I said becomes taboo. They send me to a psychiatrist, or if I am too honest, I would end up in a psych ward, which would only add more trauma to what I am already going through. What is ironic is that my chart already notes that I have a psychiatrist and a therapist and that I am medicated for mental health. But no, these doctors just push you into cycle after cycle with no end.

It is not only doctors. People I know act as if I do not want to live simply because of how limited my life has become and how low my quality of life is. It is absurd. It has been a year of not sleeping well, being in constant burning pain, being unable to leave the house, dropping out of university, and being unable to work. I am only causing financial problems for my parents. I do not want to die. I just cannot stand this nightmare. I just wish people would be honest with one another especially during times like this.

1py3bpj,You wouldn’t be in pain if you got some exercise and good sleep,"I hear a lot of “exercise more, sleep more, eat better, practice mindfulness and do yoga…” and many other variations of what can be labelled as “non meditation or surgical options to improve pain”. 

My issue with doctors or just people in general pushing this ideology is that usually it’s miss used. Here’s my examples.

A cancer patient doing yoga/exercise may improve their condition, making them feel somewhat better, but in most cases it wouldn’t change the need for surgical intervention or chemotherapy/radiotherapy to actually treat the cancer.

A T1 diabetic could follow a careful diet which would likely improve their condition but would in all likelihood not eradicate the need for insulin or glucose support.

A person could lose a limb post traumatic injury and could try mindfulness to improve their feelings about their situation but it wouldn’t change the need for a mobility aid or prosthetic. 

So yes, exercise, sleep, eating good and so on would be helpful for someone with pain it would also be beneficial to almost anyone in any state of ill health but if it doesn’t single-handedly cure or massively improve the condition why would that be any different for pain. 

It’s not that I don’t believe natural therapy and remedies are useful they are but I’m tried of pretending it would be appropriate for doctor to prescribe water, exercise or mindfulness for any other condition. So why pain. The reality is pain isn’t visible and there’s no effective way of measuring it so it’s hard for doctors to trust all their patients knowing at least a percentage of them will be drug seekers. But again in no other part of life is it okay to revoke something a large portion of people need just because a portion of people abuse it. 

If I lied about having a cough to get hold of prescription cough syrup for drug abuse it would not mean that the next person isn’t allowed to buy cough syrup anymore- that simply wouldn’t make sense.

So please don’t let your doctor prescribe you the above before A) even running tests to see what’s wrong or B) as a stand alone treatment. So during your next appointment counter argue what the doctor is saying politely, ask for research that backs their claims. And please please please you must stress that the overall success and helpfulness of said therapy should be significantly more prominent and effective that, surgery or medication (whatever you’re after). 

The reality is even if a normal (non medically complex?!?) individual was to adopt these practices they too would feel better so yes acknowledge that the therapy is beneficial agree to it but do not let it be the only thing you do unless that’s YOUR CHOICE. 

It’s okay to say “so if I exercise my pain will disappear?… how does that work?…so if I had (idk a tumour) I could exercise the pain away…”

Or “so surely it would make sense for mindfulness to be standard practice for pain relief… if I get in a car accident could I think the pain away?… so youre 100% sure if I go home and do some yoga for a while my pain is a okay- no more appointments… you can make that happen? It’ll really take away my pain 😱🤯.” “How come changing my diet didn’t work the first 5 times what’s different now?” Honestly the more stupid you sound the more it proves how stupid the point is. I doubt many doctors will all of a sudden agree with you they’ll probably say “well I can’t promise you it will be 100% effective and it’s different for everyone.” And that’s your in to say “so maybe it’s more effective to combine the two!”

With this i would like to say don’t talk down to your doctor or be rude when making these points it can just be useful to “argue back” without being aggressive or drug seeking- asking questions about how non medical therapies work and their benefits is not drug seeking behaviour because on the off chance a non medical treatment is actually found to be way way way more beneficial than medication its useful for you to know. 

I can’t say I’ve had the opportunity to use my statements yet but I have been inquisitive in the past and it’s genuinely improved my trust and relationship with a doctors. It also helps because it will 100% show the difference between your doctor genuinely caring about alternative treatments that could help you and a doctor that thinks everyone is drug seeking! So you can know who you should invest money and time into. Find a doctor who’s pationate about effective treatment and making your life better not a doctor who’s addicted to the power of being a doctor, dictating your pain and thus your life.

If you made it this far thanks for reading and I hope at least some of this is helpful and if you have any advice I’d love to know! ",1766957987.0,18,20,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1py0b28,My severe chronic pain was avoidable,"I am struggling so much. I am unable to sit or stand long at all. I can't work, can't cook, barely socialise. Pretty much of the majority of life requires your leg to not be elevated. And when my leg is not elevated I end up in severe pain.  

I got a dvt after surgery & ended up with chronic leg pain. For a start I had the surgery when I had a UTI, surgeon told me it would be fine. But I ended up really weak after surgery, resulted in deterioration in my mobility. I was discharged home very immobile, blood clot risk not reassessed. I was on aspirin rather than anticoagulants. My leg swelled. My family told me it was normal for hip surgery but it was 2 weeks after surgery and much worse than it should be, I couldnt bend my leg. I kept saying for 5 days I thought I had clot, they said i didn't and didn't want to take me to get it checked.  I clearly wasn't thinking straight. I was unable to go to hospital myself due to being unwell & very poor mobility, couldn't even open my front door. But being told I didn't have a clot i was still unsure. I should have rang hospital for help rather than trust families opinion. I just couldn't work out how I would get to hospital etc. I clearly wasn't thinking clearly either. 

So now I live with pain that disrupts my entire life. And any of these things could have prevented it. If only had insisted I had a clot & gone on day 1 it probably wouldn't have been as bad. Or if I had been given anticoagulants may not have got a DVT etc. I'm only 33. And it feels like my life is over. Living with regret is so hard ",1766950693.0,7,5,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1pxzlv8,Central or South American Countries for Pain Treatment,"Tl;dr: Where in Central or South America do they offer good pain treatment?

I'm hoping you guys can help. My doctor decided that because I picked up my medication a few days late a couple of months ago (due to a pain crash) or maybe because if I can manage to work (from home, mostly) 2 days a week, I don't need pain medication/I'm an addict. So I have been left to go cold turkey from a 50 mcg fentanyl patch. It's been a great holiday, let me tell you!

Anyway, I am hoping to get in with my partner's family doctor (he sees the whole family, so we are hoping if we all beg him, he may take me on), but here in Canada, it's damn near impossible to get a new doctor, so I'm not super hopeful. Even if he does, there is no guarantee he will agree to reinstate my medication.

For the record, I've had CRPS for 18 years, and I've tried literally everything - it's a list 3 pages long! Canada doesn't have any other treatments I can try. I can't even count how many pain clinics I've been to (they're the new cash cow for the private health shit; last one recommended I drive 2+ hours each way, every 2 days for injections that I've already tried and that didn't work)

So I'm looking at moving to somewhere that I can get some decent pain treatment. I speak English and can manage in Spanish (working on it), and while I have some money, I don't have ""living in Europe"" money. I'm looking for somewhere in Central or South America that is reasonably safe, where I can get pain treatment. Mexico is amazing and safe, but bad pain treatment; Guatemala is less safe; and El Salvador is terrifying - to give you an idea of my ideas of ""safe.""

I've been looking at Ecuador, Colombia, and Chile so far, but I would like to know if there are other countries I should consider. I would also be open to other countries that have reasonable pain treatment options and a relatively cheap cost of living. 

I understand that I would be paying for private health coverage (or per service) in the country I go to. I have money set aside for this as well as our living expenses. 

The basic plan would be to visit on a tourist visa, if we like it, get a digital nomad visa and stay for as long as that allows. We could then decide if we want to stay long term and apply for appropriate visas after that. ",1766949036.0,5,8,ChronicPain,mental_physical

Sorry if my writing is unreadable. English is not my mother tongue and I am emotionally cornered right now. 

Today morning I woke up with terrible pain at the edge of my left scapula, right shoulder and neck. I couldn't even cry since pain got worse whenever I moved my body. No matter lying down, standing, sitting... It just hurt like crazy.  It was so early in the morning and none of hospitals were open yet I had to wait in pain for 4 hours before I actually saw the doctor. I knew something was very off since the pain were nothing like what I have experienced before, but I got devastated when I saw my MRI.

Yep, just like in the title, I found out I have disc protrusion and cervical lordosis reversal (my neck bone is shaped like reversed c lol...).

1pxjhe1,"I can't figure out which would be worse for my pain: lying in bed, or sitting at a desk. And I can't decide if I want to cry or scream about it.","I've (35F mildly obese) been having debilitating pain in my feet, calves, hands, elbows, and sometimes forearms for a year. Actually, I've had pretty severe foot pain when working (or standing or walking too long) ever since I got my first job at 19. But it's gotten hellishly worse this year. Lots of tests, nothing. Finally getting MRIs, looking for MS among other things. (And that's a whole other emotional mess, I'm glad I'm getting the tests and want more than anything to know what it is but I'm terrified of that result.) 

It's been getting worse for a year. The pain in the feet is changing. It's so bad now that I've had to stop making my family dinner the one night a week I was asked to, and when we went to see Christmas lights at the zoo, I had to be pushed in a wheelchair. (Also love people staring, especially when I stood up to move a little closer to something. Like no one is allowed to use a wheelchair unless they literally can't get out of it.)

At my doctor appointment the other day, he said I'm deconditioned, because I haven't been moving as much, because, DUH. Said I need to try to strike a balance, move enough to not make my pain worse. It felt condescending but it's not an unfair point. 

So today I went to a Hotworx session with my mom for the first time in a while. It's an infrared sauna studio where you do isometric exercises with pre recorded trainer sessions. I decided to do ""barre none"" which is ballet poses to improve balance and strengthen feet legs and glutes. I took it easy. I didn't hold the poses for the full times, I took breaks, I didn't do poses that had me standing on one foot or bearing my weight on my hands at all. And for the last 15 minutes of the 40, I actually just laid on the mat. Sometimes the heat and infrared alone helps with the pain. 

Of course, my feet hurt much worse now. My hands too, not as badly. And then, I got a new shooting pain starting from the base of my spine, going up to my middle back and down through one buttock to the top of my thigh. A new pain, great!!! 

I don't think this fucking ""balance"" exists. One short and gentle exercise only fucked me up worse. And what did the doctors give me for pain when I asked? Fucking ibuprofen, 800mg twice daily. It's barely doing anything. They think it's neuropathic pain but I'm already on gabapentin which also does nothing. 

I wanted to play a computer game, before that new pain started. Then I figured I should just lie in bed and watch TV. Then I realized with where the new pain is, BOTH of those options are likely to cause more pain. 

I'm just so angry, and I want to cry.

I met someone amazing about a month and half, two months ago, maybe? They are everything I've ever wanted, just when I was starting to give up on love. 

And then I got sick. Really sick. Been going on over two weeks and not getting better. No one knows for sure what it is but I suspect gastroparesis with some associated intestinal issues as well. No medications have helped so far and trying to get further testing or specialist care where I live is nearly impossible. This could be anywhere from terminal (if it turns out to not be treatable with either meds or surgery) or could continue to be severe, debilitating chronic illness. The BEST case scenario that I can imagine right now would still involve major surgery for my condition- ileostomy etc, maybe something for my bladder as well which also seems to be losing function. I don't even know yet if these things would fix my problems - obviously they come with their own set of complications - but I'm hoping SOMETHING can be done to keep me alive even if it's difficult to deal with. 

The sticky thing is I only know what I've been told for sure. I haven't improved in two weeks. I have bad chronic constipation and bloating. I'm rapidly losing weight. The past few days my bladder also seems to be barely working. These things all seem extremely worrisome to me but I don't actually know yet if they're treatable and if so what my life will look like. 

I love this person. I really do. I felt that way before getting sick, it was just too early to say. I just feel terribly guilty now every time I talk to them. We're so young (them 25, me 26) and they didn't sign up for this. I've told them honestly that my health has been bad and doesn't seem to be improving. I told them some details of my symptoms. They seem optimistic still but I don't feel optimistic and I don't know what to do. I feel almost a moral obligation to break up with them before it gets worse- god forbid if I do die, I'd want them to think of me healthy- but then, I think they would also be upset if they felt I was leaving them prematurely if there's a chance I could get fixed up.

1pxd3tq,Calm Your Frazzled Nerves,"It's not a cure, but it is physiology!  Anxiety over pain increases pain & suffering. You know, the thoughts about the pain... worrying it's going to get worse, that it will never end, etc. That's anxiety. In addition, our body is ALREADY in fight/flight, thinking there is an immediate threat of danger. But with chronic pain, we are ""no longer being chased by a lion"", but our body is acting as if we are, trying to protect us. Being in this constant state, even if we can't tell, increases pain and can potentially cause all kinds of other symptoms, such as additional muscle tension, and contributes to other future long term health conditions, like high blood pressure and dysautonomia. There are things we can do things to positively influence our nervous system, and turn on a more healthy state, what we call ""rest/digest"" or ""rest/relaxation"". This isn't about curing pain. It is about reducing aspects that contribute to increased pain, fatigue and relieving some of the anxiety that comes along with being in chronic pain. When the word ""trauma' is often used, it includes the experience of chronic pain, so don't let that deter you from trying different videos. The first two minutes of this video, the only movement standing up and gentle, the rest is very gentle, sitting in one place, so skip the beginning if you can't do it, but if you can try it for at least 30 seconds. Vagus nerve stimulation has become a ""hot topic"", there's even a medical implant. Anyway, personally, I find vagus nerve stimulation very helpful. Some people are very familiar with this, but I don't notice it very often in this sub.

1pxbgzy,Posting this for anyone who has trouble tolerating opioid medication,"Hi all. I posted on here a while ago when I was feeling extremely hopeless and depressed. I had been put on tramadol and gabapentin, and it wasn’t going well. But I’m glad I kept pushing. Again, thank you for all the support I got. Long story short, I discovered I have some enzyme metabolic abnormalities. I’m getting a full panel test soon. I’m an Ultrarapid metabolizer and intermediate in two other enzymes, one of which is CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing most opioid medications. Basically, I have unpredictable reactions, and my body clears it from my system much quicker than expected. Since finding that out and getting in with a woman pain management doctor instead of a man (I’m in an area where men doctors are notorious for dismissing women patients concerns), I showed proof of my enzyme issues and provided some alternatives that may work better with my enzyme metabolisms. Now, they have me on amitriptyline low dose and butrans patches low dose. For the first time in a year or longer, I haven’t cried every day from pain this week. I’ve been able to shower without near-syncope and without pain. I haven’t had to use my shower chair half as much. I’m able to get out of bed in the morning and stand up and walk to the bathroom without pain. I was able to do my weekly volunteer work with ease for the first time ever. It’s been life changing. 

So, I wanted to post about this for anyone with chronic pain who hasn’t responded well to pain medications or treatments, get enzyme testing. If you can prove enzyme metabolic abnormalities, you’re much more likely to be helped rather than labeled drug seeking, over-dramatic, psychosomatic, lying, or all the above. Also, if you’re a complex case, I highly recommend seeking out younger doctors. I’ve found that older doctors tend to be less educated/have outdated education without willingness to update or comply with new findings, or are just ready to retire and don’t want tough cases. (Obviously this doesn’t apply to all older doctors, but this has been my personal experience)

We’re still trying to get to the bottom of what all is happening with my spine and legs. Personally, I still think it’s just the deformity and the cyst, but I’ll let them take all the imaging and tests they want if it means it’ll satisfy their curiosity and get me help. I wish everyone here the best of luck, and I hope this is able to help anyone out there who may need it. May you all have a blessed day, and may good pain relief/management and solutions find you all 🩵",1766877109.0,11,11,ChronicPain,mental_physical

1px9oes,Is anyone else so tired of explaining their chronic pain to people and especially doctors?,"People who have never experienced chronic pain have no idea what it is actually like. Even when you explain it they still do not understand. I told someone that my chronic pain is making me extremely depressed and their response was to tell me to push myself to go on walks because it would boost my mood or to take baby steps. First of all it feels insulting to spend the energy explaining my condition only for them to ignore it entirely. I am housebound and going outside will trigger a flare no matter what I do yet I am still told to push myself. Second I do not understand the obsession with baby steps. Baby steps toward what exactly. People seem to think chronic pain is like cancer something you can fight through if you are resilient enough. That mindset is ignorant.

I had a friend tell me that I could get used to the pain and that other people have learned to live with pain based on her research. I was very close to blocking them.

I do not even want to get started on doctors. They act like they are angels for not prescribing pain medication. The attitude feels like you can suffer but at least you will not become an addict or overdose. As if I am supposed to be grateful for being left in pain. Like I should kneel and thank them for caring so much. Fuckers.",1766872363.0,272,76,ChronicPain,mental_physical

I have a question though.

I have read people going through that tend to be people taking prednisone for weeks or months or long term. And then they stop too fast without tapering super slowly over weeks and stuff 

I have read of people even getting a one time five or six day taper of prednisone or methyl prednisone and there’s even warnings on those taper one time packs to not stop them cold turkey 

But how could adrenal long term problems possibly even become a chronic issue for someone stopping these one time steroid packs too early?

1pwnq14,Reducing pain and desensitisation of hand/arm,"  
Hey everyone,  
  
A little while back, I had a work related incident where I impaled my hand with a nailgun. I have since developed CRPS, mechanical pain in the wrist (due to severe pisiform pain) and ulnar pain. I have had several nerve blocks (and most recently a Stellate ganglion nerve block) for the CRPS pain, and I am looking at a pisiform excision for the mechanical pain.  
  
I'm young, and as you can imagine, this has severely disrupted my life. Fixing the pain isn't easy because the various types of pain are overlapping, so doing one kind of physiotherapy or remedy often impacts the other, or leads to a misdiagnosis. I do have the support of doctors, but in my day to day life, migrating the pain is very, very difficult  
  
Do you guys have any personal suggestions with:  
  
1) treating CRPS pain (desensitisation) and ulnar nerve pain? The latter is often worse, with everything from my wrist to my elbow feeling like it's severely bruised.  
  
2) reducing said pain? Using kinesis, heat packs, lidocaine patches? I have some supplies like this, but it's often hard to determine what I should and shouldn't do.  
  
Any and all suggestions are welcome.

  
(In line with the subreddit rules, I am not asking for straight medical advice - I'm thinking more about everyday, simple fixes that have worked for you, even something as simple as using hand cream to massage the limb before bed could be of help!)

It also doesn’t help that I feel humanity is hopeless. The state of the world, the awful things happening, it’s all too much. I’m a paediatric nurse and I work at one of the best children’s hospitals in the uk, naturally I see a lot of children at their worst. Sometimes seeing what I see makes me angry at myself for being so negative and miserable over my pain because it could never compare to what I see. 

People shouldn’t have to live in pain, children shouldn’t be fighting battles before they’ve even started school, poverty is everywhere and the economy is only getting worse, families are losing loved ones all the time because people have found more peace in suicide than in humanity. So yes I do feel hopeless.

I feel angry all the time. I have no patience for my pain and as soon as it starts to become unbearable the state of my life and humanity is all I can think about- obsessively.

i still only sat, and i mostly just watched, that definitely didnt change. but what did change was that i was more sociable, and i actually participated in the games they played. today, i took home my very first white elephant gift, and i learned how to play left, right, center

photos are another no-go, as i know how sick i look physically, and i cant stand seeing that preserved for everyone to see even after im gone. i cant stand having to see them myself should anyone decide to save them for another day. but i let my mother have a photo this time, and i even made an appearance in a polaroid where the whole family was included. i was pretty much entirely obscured among the crowd, sure, but my head is there!!

im tired. my stomachs been hurting on and off. i couldnt eat anything except a couple of chocolates and water all day. i couldn't shower. im freezing cold. i know i wont be able to move from this spot at my desk for the next 8 hours. but im still so happy that i went

i cried getting ready to leave this morning. i took forever to get ready, having to sit over and over again to breathe through the pain i was feeling, and how weak i was. but i still dressed myself up, did my hair, put on some reindeer ear hair clips

my bag went with me, full of supportive items. anti-sickness pills, a vomit bag, peppermint oil, stress toys, my teddy bear, water, a book, my switch, my phone, my bluetooth earbuds. i didn't have to use any of it. i was okay

sorry if this was long. i just wanted to share one of the little victories ive had recently. i spent christmas eve alone, stuck in my house and fighting relentless sickness and pain. i didn't wanna give in to that again on christmas day, and so despite the rough start, i still made myself get up and go through with something that although i knew i wanted, wouldn't be easy to see through. im proud of myself, and moments like these are a reminder that i am still strong and resilient despite the many days and nights where it feels like im anything but

regardless of whether you went out on the town or stayed home wrapped securely in your blankets, i hope that you all have a wonderful christmas and a happy new year. show yourself grace and give yourself a pat on the back for getting through another year, even if youre a bit more broken and battered by the end of it. its okay if we need more time to do what should come naturally, it does make you lesser. the most important thing is that you do it, even if it takes you days, weeks, or years

thank you for reading this far if you managed it. if you have anything you wanna share in response, whether it be negative or positive, please feel free to share!! im so happy to have found this community, and i want to give back in whatever way i can, even if its just to provide a listening ear

The pain pump is useless because the PM could not keep a certified PA\Dr for increases or even to refill!

The PM changed software the same day she was due. 
Well over the next 7-10 days she kept calling & texting them(the will not answer the phone).

1pwbmxo,Pain..and the torture of life,"Been physically & mentally hurting for over 40 years. Been seeing mental health providers for over 25 years. Physical pain is 24/7/365. Seen a doc that helped ab it with the physical part. Spinal Cord Stimulator got me off of a 25 year Opioid/Gabapentin/Xanax dependency. Still physically hurt quite a bit. All my images don't show anything noteworthy. Mental health guy is working with me, trying to sort thru my past trauma. Sadly, the root of all my mental health headaches is locked away, I am unable to access it. But we are trying. Then this is this time of the year. Was employed by the USPS for close to 20 years...the holidays just meant 0 time off. Lot of OT. Between the physical/mental/USPS I pretty much despise this time of the year. We relocated in 2008. First Christmas we were here we had to put one of our pups, Max, to sleep. Couple years ago Mr T passed away few weeks before his 6th Birthday. Vet had removed his spleen, he had the Cancer/Tumor that attaches to blood rich organs. Vet was on the last stitch when his heart stopped. Feel largely responsible for Mr Trumps passing. He had been restless, not acting himself for several days/nights and I did nothing. Couple of years before Mr T's passing we lost one of his cousins, Mita, to the same thing. Mita and Mr T came from the same breeder. Both had the same papa dog. Talked with the breeder, whom we are friends with. Been breeding the same blood line for over 30 years with no other pups having problems. Breeder know where every one of his pups ended up so have no reason to doubt him.

Then today..sitting here in front of my computer. Heard one of our African Greys crash to the floor of the cage. Got up to check on them, RaRa, our 40 year old bird was laying motionless, he passed away.

My wife was born and raised in Phoenix. She left her family behind to move with me. I feel largely responsible for her feeling down frequently. She misses her family. With me in the position I am in physically, our financial issues, her going to see her family always poses a problem.

Have talked with a friend. I mentioned I am grateful for being on the back side of this miserable existence. Went as far as saying I have had enough and am ready to check out. Self harm is not an issue. Hell...I had a loaded revolver in my mouth and pulled the trigger only to have it not fire. But I have had enough. Life should not be like this.

To top it off my wife has had enough of talking with me over all of this crap. So I sit here...in silence. ",1766774725.0,8,1,ChronicPain,mental_physical

I rarely get validation from him or friends. They say things like “everyone has pain,” “it’s in your head,” ""we have problems too but we don't talk about them"", or “see a psychiatrist.” Recently my spouse screamed at me, saying we’re spending money with no results and that he’s scared about the future. I earn more than him, but he says I’m spending our money. I have nobody else to go to. Fortunately, I have a career and pay my own bills, but what will happen if I can’t work in the future? I pulled away because I felt unsafe and invalidated.

Has anyone else experienced this? How do you cope and protect yourself without disconnecting completely?

Edit to add: Thank you all for your kind responses. My spouse did apologize for his recent outburst, but this was not the first time it has happened, and I know it will likely happen again.

1pw2ebx,Scary flare up - advice please,"Cross posting to get more insight- I’ve been diagnosed with POTS, vasovagal syncope and orthostatic hypotension.

I am on vacation in a SE country and I was excited because my partner and I had booked a hospital visit. I’ve been dealing with debilitating chronic constipation for over 2 years and no doctor in my home country can figure it out.

I went to the appointment the doctor apologized to me and said there was nothing they could do for me and said the dreaded words “Have you tried exercise? Relaxing more? Or maybe eating more fibre?”  I left the appointment in tears.

We then went to another hospital that had good reviews (similar to the last) and this doctor was so kind and understanding, but told me he thinks I might have a complex case and need to see a neurologist in my home country. He also apologized.

Both hospitals didn’t charge anything and somehow their apologies just made me feel worse.

And then the crash hit.

I’ve had POTS flare ups 100000’s of times. But this was insane and I’m so scared it might happen again.

It felt like my skin was on fire. Like someone was continuously breaking my bones. It felt like all my joints were breaking and being rebroken over and over. I couldn’t eat or drink. I was shaking and sobbing. The pain was inside of my bones and nothing was relieving it. I felt like I was outside of my body at some points and was almost delirious.

This insane flare finally ended this morning. Two days after it started. I’ve had flares last a week before but they were manageable and I could still drink and eat.

There are definitely muscles that overcompensate for some of the damaged ones, and although I’ve gone to pt for years, nothing has improved. 

One of the things that constantly happens is that one of my left floating ribs gets pulled out of place and needs to be shoved back in. Sometimes I don’t push it back in because it makes it so sore, but if I don’t, I can feel it as I can only describe as chafing on top of my other ribs. Sometimes it goes in & out if I’m taking deep breaths. The only thing that really helps keep it in place is wearing a corset as tight as it can be, which I can only tolerate for so long. 

Does anyone else deal with this, and if so, how have you been able to address it? Has anyone gotten their rib(s) removed for medical purpose?

I went with undiagnosed chronic pain for 3 decades, and will be seeing my family Dr soon to seek a diagnosis. I'm very nervous about not being able to effectively advocate for what I need. I'm looking for suggestions for what diagnosis routes and tests to ask for.

In the past, I described it as ""joint pain"" , and was repeatedly sent to do X-rays that showed nothing. I don't normally show swelling or redness.

More recently I came to recognize my pain isn't actually in my joints, but is located Around joint areas: elbows, hips, shoulders, wrists, ankles, toes and fingers, knuckles, more rarely spine. I experience pain every day, and it tends to be worse later in the day, when stressed, or when working, and feels better with rest. 

I also had an ACL snap 15 years ago. The injury wasn't triggered by an impact event, but had occured while I was experiencing a decline in physical activity and muscle mass. Since then my flare-ups spread and became much worse.

My immediate family lets me stay with them and it’s a blessing, but seeing people my age with significant others, great jobs, and living on their own sting and makes me envious.",1766630929.0,39,16,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1pv1osr,You learned how to lie how you feel.,"Everyone asks how you’re doing
like it’s polite,
like it’s harmless.

They don’t ask because they want the truth.
They ask because silence makes them uncomfortable,
because pretending is easier than listening.

So you say you’re fine.
You always say you’re fine.
You say it even while your chest is collapsing inward,
even while your body feels like it’s fighting itself,
even while your mind is screaming for relief.

You learn quickly that honesty has a cost.
If you tell the truth,
they stare too long
or not long enough.
They offer advice you didn’t ask for,
solutions that don’t work,
or worse—nothing at all.

They say things like
“stay positive,”
“it could be worse,”
“everything happens for a reason,”
as if pain is a lesson
and not a weight that grinds you down every day.

They don’t see the nights
where sleep refuses to come,
where you replay conversations,
appointments,
missed calls,
waiting rooms,
and unanswered questions.

They don’t feel how exhausting it is
to wake up again
when your body is heavy
and your hope is thin.

So you lie.
Not because you want to,
but because telling the truth
means being misunderstood,
dismissed,
or treated like a problem
no one knows how to fix.

You carry it alone,
because carrying it together
requires people who will stay
after the answer isn’t simple.

And that’s the cruel part—
not that you’re hurting,
but that you’ve learned
it’s easier to suffer quietly
than to watch people
slowly stop asking.

1puytlz,Why is soma so difficult to get anymore?,"About a decade ago I was prescribed soma 450mg 4x a day along with hydrocodone 10mg 6x a day, and my pain (Sacroiliitis and bursitis in both hips) was well managed then. 

My doctor retired and I ended up raw-doggin life for 7 years until I herniated a disc in L5-S1. Went to pain management again and was prescribed perc 5mg 4x a day and cyclobenzaprine. Neither touched the pain, so I asked about soma since I'd had a good experience with it in the past. ""I don't prescribe that"". .... ok. 

So after 3 surgeries, MRIs showing scoliosis, retrolisthesis, spondylitis, stenosis and a couple more bulged and herniated discs, they worked me up to 8 10mg oxy a day, pregablin, duloxetine, cyclobenzaprine and mobic. I stopped the pregablin and mobic because they did nothing for me and I was managing well with the oxy, duloxetine and cyclobenzaprine. 

Then I moved from Colorado to Georgia and my new pm doc cut my oxy in half to 4 10mg per day without a taper and I about fuckin killed myself because the pain was so bad. Apparently, this specific pm office will not prescribe anything over 60 mme per day, regardless of diagnosis. So I asked about getting soma to help with the hip pain, and again was told that they do not prescribe that. 

Why is this incredible medication so difficult to get? It helps with my pain so much, I'd probably be able to cut my oxy in half again if I had soma. Does anyone have any insight?",1766614776.0,30,41,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1puycii,I wish I could be profitable and happy at the same time.,"All I want to do is work, but on the things I care about. I want to continue my studies, I want to develop my projects that may be profitable someday, I want to use the limited energy I have to do things that matter in the world and to me.

I also need to survive. I get some support from my family, but it isn't enough. They need me to work, and without a college degree all the jobs available to me are either restaurant/retail/other physical labor jobs, or desk jobs that are braindead easy, not remotely in my field, and that suck up 5/7 of the week.

It's not that I can't work, but that when I work a job like either of the above, I can't do anything else. It devours all my energy, and when I go home it's all I can do to keep my living space and body clean and maybe watch a little TV before crashing out to recover energy. It makes it a struggle to continue school or work on projects, and almost impossible to balance both while working. In theory I should have plenty of time in the day for anything, but I'm so exhausted when I'm working that I can't make use of that time.

But I can't not work. My family's patience is running thin as it is and I've been homeless repeatedly in the last year. I haven't been able to do much of anything in that state either.

I just wish I could be given a UBI and allowed to live my life. I am not made to work ""starter jobs"" and pull my bootstraps, but the things I am working on will still benefit humanity if I could just be allowed to get through fucking school and pursue work in the field I am passionate about, and devote a little time to my art.

I will write in bullets where I can


Everyone says physical therapy but it is not helping long term. Everyday I have to start from scratch. May be it improve like 30 % since July. Which is still better than where I started but it is pushing my sanity to keep on the same treatment plan.

History.
1. Neck injury or entrapment ( because I carried a heavy backpack for 1 hr) resulted in occipital Neuralgia plus the scapular diskynesia. Or may be I always had it, it was not painful until I got occipital neautalgua
2. Treatments for ON: nerve block, RFA. Most of my migraines and scalene pain is gone. Botox on 18th this month for scapular diskynesia pain and neck pain along with loss of ROM ( praying Botox works, but already disappointed so far), doctor said to wait for two weeks.
3. Taping my shoulder  blade and levator scapula fixes my pain by 80%> but can't keep it as such for rest of my life. Adding pictures. Does the taping give any hint what will help in long term? Like fusing the scapula. I already have spine fusion which was like a second life. I am open to a major surgery for shoulder also. Although I am sure it cant be more complex that the PSO and fusion I had on my spine from t10 to pelvis
4. Physical therapy for scapular stabilization, snow angels also works but each day I have to start from scratch and even then pain returns in few hours  
5. Can I get a surgery to fix it?

Sorry for not a well written post. I am hopeless and don't even believe someone will give me an advice which will help me. But I want to try and making efforts to ask once again. ",1766612207.0,13,11,ChronicPain,mental_physical

All kinds of scans are completely clear. And the worst part is I’m never comfortable in my own body. There is no position that gives me relief. Sitting, standing, lying down, on my back, on my stomach, nothing helps. I can’t relax, not even for a second.

I can’t concentrate on anything. I have constant brain fog. I can’t follow conversations, I can’t watch a movie, I can’t focus on the simplest things. It feels like my mind and my body are completely fried.

And the most frustrating part? There’s no clear reason for this pain. It started at the gym and that’s it. Central sensitization, nociplastic pain, myofascial pain syndrome, whatever. Fuck it. I’m so tired of labels. None of them change how bad this hurts.

I’m not exaggerating when I say I would’ve preferred cancer over this shit. At least then you die with society’s empathy. Or even being paralyzed from the waist down and stuck in a wheelchair.

My Myoclonus that started ten years ago and went into partial remission has also come back with a vengeance. How do you fall asleep if you are being electrocuted all the time by nerves?

1pu76sh,Hip pain after walking for 20-30 minutes,"Hey guys, I’m not really sure where else to put this, I just want to see if anyone else has dealt with this and what they did about it.

About a year ago I (25f) was uh, doing it with my husband, and my hip suddenly started hurting so bad I had to stop immediately. I had been rotating my hips in a circular motion, not uncommon for me, but my left hip just randomly decided it no longer liked that.

It was fine the next day until I went on a walk with my friend. 8 minutes into the walk it started hurting, and by the end of the walk it was unbearable. My husband and I used to go on walks every day after work but we had to stop and it made me pretty sad. I also missed going on hikes. And it interfered with certain social events which was really upsetting, I either simply wouldn’t participate or I would feel horrible when things had to be cut short for me.

I started seeing a chiropractor about this, and I’m not sure if it was the care she provided or just my body healing over the next few months but we were able to get my walks up to 20-30 minutes. Kept working on it, also I started consistently working out at home in the summer and have kept it up since (I also noticed there are certain exercises, like the really repetitive leg ones such as lunges, that cause stress to my hip within only 30 seconds or so).

My husband and I were able to resume our walks because they took about half an hour to get around our neighborhood block anyway. My limit kinda fluctuated but never got over 40 minutes until one time a couple months ago we were able to go on a nearly one hour hike and I was over the moon!!

But then as the colder months moved in, our walks became less frequent. Aaaand now I have regressed back down to 20 minutes. Despite keeping up the workouts at home. I am devastated. I’m really tempted to quit paying for chiropractic care if a year of it has not cured my hip. Seems more likely that my consistent walking, steadily increasing how long I go, is what helped me. 

But like, is having s*x really what caused this? I couldn’t have been going that hard. Would a single night of s*x really screw me over for a WHOLE YEAR afterwards? I know I always stood and sat really weird from childhood (I used to sit in the W as a kid, and I still always cross my legs when standing or else I feel somewhat unstable if I don’t). I think I was just born with weird weak hips, and that one experience and my hip had enough.

During this time, about half way through or so, my right hip started “clicking,” like popping when I rotate it inward. The pops “recharge” literally every couple minutes and I’m not even exaggerating (I timed it). It never feels right, always feels like there’s air in there I need to get out.

So really, both my hips are messed up but I can’t pinpoint a particular moment my right hip started having issues like I did with my left one. 

Am I treating this all wrong though? My chiropractor said I might end up needing an MRI to see if it’s something with the tissue. I am hoping to avoid any big medical bills, I would honestly rather just not walk. But it does suck sometimes to not be able to just go have fun in nature and walk without restrictions. 

So I am going to get a walking pad so I can walk at home more and slowly work back up to increase my limit without having to walk in the cold, or alone. But is there anything else I can do to help ease the pain in the meantime? Would a cane do me any good? A hip brace?

1pu4aq6,"Years of Knee Pain, Many Wrong Turns, and a Diagnosis I Didn’t Expect","This is **not medical advice**. It’s simply my personal experience, shared in case it resonates with someone else.

In my early 70s, I was an active tennis player. Then my knee started to cause serious problems. Swelling, pain, and recurring fluid buildup gradually forced me to reduce and almost abandon the sport I loved.

Over several years, I visited many orthopedic doctors. My knee repeatedly filled with fluid. Through paracentesis, nearly **one liter of fluid** was drained over time. I went through around **20 physiotherapy sessions** with no real improvement. I was treated with PRP (platelet-rich plasma injections). No result.

I eventually underwent arthroscopy. The finding was *rheumatic Hymenitis*, but no severe structural damage. I was told, *“There’s no reason to see a rheumatologist.”*

Still, the pain continued.

I had multiple MRI scans over the years four in about a decade. Each time I was told:

“The knee isn’t that bad. This is arthritis.”

I was prescribed anti-inflammatory medications. One of them caused **gastrointestinal bleeding**, and I was hospitalized for four days. Meanwhile, my quality of life declined. I could no longer hike, walk long distances, or play tennis.

Eventually, I did see a rheumatologist. After ruling out other conditions, I was placed on medication again without improvement. The knee continued to swell. More fluid was drained.

Finally, I was advised to see another rheumatologist. He ordered additional imaging and tests. After reviewing them, he said something I hadn’t heard before:

“Your knee itself isn’t the primary problem. You have psoriatic arthritis.”

I was prescribed a specific treatment regimen. Within a short time, the swelling stopped. The pain disappeared. The knee stabilized.

Years later, at **82**, I can play tennis again.

As an unexpected bonus, the same treatment also resolved longstanding psoriasis in my ears and scalp something I had lived with for years.

I share this not as a solution for others, but as a reminder that **persistent symptoms sometimes need a different perspective**, and that inflammatory or autoimmune causes can be overlooked for a long time.

1ptzww0,I feel like giving up,"Sorry If this is kinda long. 
I’m 22 years old. I was healthy basically my entire life. I was extremely athletic to the point I could get up and run 3km if I felt like it. I’m sure most of you relate to this. That’s probably why a lot of us are here. We miss what use to be our normal. 

I have been experiencing a really slow onset of something for years. It was small stuff that I didn’t notice at first like my finger hurting. Could be for any reason. Maybe I hit it in my sleep. Then, it was cognitive decline at 18, but I chalk it up to “who knows? I’m getting older. Maybe I just lost my sparkle”. Next, the dizzy spells, but I’ve always had low iron so maybe it’s just that. In 2024 I started having chronic dryness. “Maybe I’m just dehydrated?” It was hard to wake up and my eyelids would literally stick together. That’s how dry I was and this was despite increasing my water intake. 

Within a few months I was forgetting things that I would usually never. I’ve always been big on birthdays, but I forgot literally every single one. This has never happened. I had completely forgotten about the fact my partner has asthma. I couldn’t even recall them telling me despite them saying we had this conversation last week. We probably did. I would turn the oven on walk over to get something and then completely forget I was cooking. 

I was still managing with the poor memory recall and stuff. Life happens sometimes and my sister got sick. It was a bit after my uncle had passed away so I was already stressed and grieving. She got hospitalized with chest pain. She’s my little sister so after school and work I would drive to the hospital. Truthfully, I was stressed out. It was almost exam season, my sister was in the hospital, I somehow have to work 20hrs and go to full time school without missing a single lab (5hrs long for no reason). Obviously the dizziness and dryness continued to get worse. At this point, I went to the doctor. The cardiologist said my heart is fine probably dysautonomia see a neurologist. Unfortunately, I got chest pain before I could even get referred. 

The chest pain felt like light pressure at first. I figured it’ll probably go away. It did NOT go away. It got worse so so much worse. Felt a tearing and it radiates to my back now. I went to the doctor and he recommended Advil. They always recommend Advil or a Tylenol. It has literally never worked. Try a muscle gel, not sure why this would work when Advil didn’t. Obviously didn’t work. They give me naproxen. Best week of the 7 months of pain. Yeah unfortunately it rebounded so bad my entire arm now cramps, tingles, and burns. It was the worst pain I’ve ever felt I thought I was dying. Obviously, that’s a sign to go to the hospital. Hospital says well fortunately you’re not pregnant and you’re not dying so go home. 

I am currently home bound. Not because of the pain. I developed an exercise intolerance. I have a tremor, exertion causes extreme pain, I’m chronically tired, chronically dry, I get dizzy to the point I can’t even walk, car vibrations make me sick, I can’t keep my arm held down, and my medication only blunts the pain. I am so uncomfortable, but you wanna know what the doctor said I have? Fibromyalgia. I definitely know there’s people in this sub with fibromyalgia. I’m just not one of them. Even I know I don’t match the diagnostic criteria and my doctors have given up on me. I don’t know what to do? Will I ever be able to be a regular 22 year old again? What is wrong with me? What do I even do when every doctor is avoiding me? I’m in so much pain 24/7. 

Sorry for the long post. I just need help from somewhere. You guys have gone through this journey before and I just wanna know what next steps I can take. I don’t want to live in pain. ",1766511309.0,6,8,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1ptxkk1,Ongoing neck pain for 3+ months. Seeking advice!,"I’ve been dealing with neck pain for over 3 months now and I can’t seem to fully get rid of it.

This started shortly after I moved to the U.S. and into an apartment with my wife. We bought a mattress and pillows from walmart. The first week felt okay but then I started feeling strain on the sides of my neck. It slowly got worse to the point where I was waking up with really bad stiffness and pain, so I went to see a chiropractor.

I explained everything to him, he did a full body adjustment, and basically told me to take Tylenol and work on my posture... the pain came back the very next day. 

Since then I’ve tried a bunch of things people recommend online and other posts:
– towel roll as a pillow
– neck stretches 3–5 times a day
– heat pad
– posture adjustments

The frustrating part is that all of this does help, but it feels like everything resets the moment I wake up. I wake up with the same neck strain again, and even turning my head hurts.

At this point it’s starting to mess with me mentally because the pain is always there and limits my movement. I am also applying for work and would want this neck pain sorted put before I start working again. Posting here to ask what actually helped others who were in a similar situation especially if you dealt with pain that kept coming back every morning.

1ptox9h,"Don’t know if it’s just chronic pain or an emergency, and I’m so, so tired.","I’m at a breaking point. I’ve had debilitating pelvic and abdominal pain for the past 9 years. No diagnosis, no closer to answers, just 9 solid years of doctors shrugging and sending me away. 

It’s every single day, impacts every aspect of my life, and feels utterly inescapable. It became the gravitational core of my whole life when it started at age 17. It sucks. It absolutely sucks. It ruined my career, it’s ruined relationships, my self-esteem, it put my dreams and prospects in the dirt before my life even really got a chance to fully start. 9 years in and I don’t think I’ll ever stop grieving. It’s devastating and so isolating. I’ve watched my peers hit milestones that quietly passed me by from a clinic or bed. I got to hear all about the rollercoaster of young adulthood while mine was slipping through the cracks, spent cradling a heating pad between doctor trips. Im bitter, im frustrated, and I’m heartbroken. 

Recently I’ve been in a health crisis. Or not. Who knows at this point? 

A new, more intense form of abdominal pain started up, which landed me in the hospital last month. They ran a blood test and decided I wasn’t in immediate danger, then sent me home with a pat on the back and a smile since ‘everything looked healthy’.

To put a long story short, It’s been a full month of coping with this pain that is different and somehow far worse than what I’m used to, and I feel utterly insane for it. I’ve collapsed in the shower 3 times in the past month and had to crawl out. Can’t count how many times I’ve had to throw away the food I managed (or tried) to make because the pain got so bad I had to abandon it to simply lay on the ground and writhe for an hour or 2. It’s hell. I’m so sick and tired of this, and I’m so sick and tired of being told time and time again that there’s nothing wrong with me. On my second hospital visit for the same pain, they referred me to see a gastroenterologist for an endoscopy. The wait time to see one where I live is on average a year. 

I got hit with another wave of pain tonight and, once again, had to crawl out of the shower, and spent a good hour just trying to get dressed. I feel like something is REALLY wrong, but I can’t face going back to the hospital for the 3rd time this month, sit in a waiting room for 8-16 hours, just to be told by the same doctor that im fine and should just take an Advil :( I’m genuinely so scared. Every other night for the past month I’ve gone to bed wondering if I’d even wake up the next morning, and I feel CRAZY for it! I’m in so much pain, i have no help, no support, and no one in my life who gets it. I’m at a breaking point and I don’t know what to do any more.

-Syncope from laughing, coughing, sneezing, bending over/to the side, etc. It’s extreme, unpredictable, and scary
-Trachea instability causing difficulty swallowing and randomly choking on spit, food, drinks, etc
-Trouble talking like my voice cracking/fading out or not coming out as loud as I intend and then I have to repeat myself

-I get lightheaded and dizzy in heat or when I’m too hot- making showers, summer time, and even higher central heat settings intolerable
-I get mentally overwhelmed and confused very easily. I can only think or do one thing at a time. If I’m currently in the middle of a thought, and someone talks to me or asks me a question, my brain and body react with confusion and I can’t think temporarily, I have to go over what they said in my brain again, and oftentimes I even stutter when I start talking.

1ptaopr,"Frustrated, lost and overall tired","Hi everyone. This might be a long one. I just discovered this sub today and thought I should use that to vent my frustration about the pain, about doctors, and about everything in general. (Just in case, english is not my first language) :

A bit of a backstory on me, I had to get spine surgery in early 2021 (at age 20) because of a herniated disc that dried up, basically 24/7 sciatica because of a pinched nerve that wouldn't get back to normal (since the disc was calcified). It is apparently something I inherited from my dad, as he also had to get surgery for this specific thing 3 times now.

Then I started feeling some weird shoulder pains a few months later in my right shoulder, I mostly noticed it when I was driving (which was and still is a rare occurence) and it mostly only bothered me then. I don't remember much from that time period but the pain was mostly sporadic, and since I have apparently the best genes ever, I learned through X-rays in 2022 that I had arthrosis in my lower back, so I thought that the shoulder pain was also because of that.

Fast forward to 2023, now I get the shoulder pain mostly when I stand up for long periods of time. I love going to the museums or even like to walk around cities, went on a trip on the other side of the world, and it bothered me a lot. Not too painful in the morning but the more I walked/stood a little too still, the worse it got, also was uncomfortable when I went to bed but the pain never woke me up. I start feeling pain in both shoulders then. Similar type of pain though it's more painful in the right one, the pain is centred around the scapula but also in front, in the acromion/bursa area. Sometimes, and its become more frequent the past 6 or so months, the pain goes all the way down to my elbow,and sometimes my thumb, something like tendonitis. (It used to be only in my right arm but now also happens in my left arm).

Since I was going to university then, it would mostly bother me on those days, but left me alone mostly on week ends or during vacation when I wasn't doing much. And the pain wasn't too intense either. Bothersome, sure, but not excruciating.

Then I got my masters in september 2024 and been unemployed since then, so that means lots of staying at home, and that's when it just got worse. The pain started being almost continuous. It's always fine in the morning, but if I'm on my laptop for too long, if I stand up for too long, if I sit down for too long at dinner or lunch, when I drive or if I'm in the passenger seat, it gets worse. Like barely-can-grab-things-from-the-cupboards worse, my ROM is awful somedays. At the end of 2024 I decide to get yet another MRI (i know i should have gotten it earlier) and the results were : two bursitis in both my shoulders. My GP said I should go see a rheumatologist, and he prescribed me PT, so thats what I did. Started in January 2025, and I've been going twice a week almost every week since then.  I tried everything, shockwave therapy, exercises, TENS therapy, nothing worked. Went back again in May to see if I could get a steroid shot for my right shoulder bursitis, which I did, and that's when he saw the capsulitis (frozen shoulder). For a bit, the steroid shot worked, but it then went back to the usual pain, not being able to lift my arm too much on ""bad"" days. I had another appointment in June where I was supposed to get another shot in my left shoulder, but he said I should continue going to PT, said the bursitis in my right shoulder disappeared though.

Then I saw the rheumatologist again in September, and he gave me a steroid shot for the capsulitis. It did NOT work. I hung out with a friend like a week later and it was back to square one. Went on vacation for a week and we hiked a lot (so lots of standing up) and it was the same thing. Horrible debilitating pain.

I got tired of it so decided to go to my GP AGAIN! She said I should see a surgeon, went to see a surgeon and it was the worst appointment of my life. He just said I was lying about being in pain, said I should go to a pain clinic, see a sophrologist. All that jazz. Also said I was too young for frozen shoulder. Great. He did prescribe me with another MRI, and the results were : nothing. Nothing showed up on the pictures. So now i'm like.. what?

Saw my rheumatologist just a week ago and after examining me and checking my shoulders with his ultrasound, he said nothing was showing up. So now apparently i don't have frozen shoulder anymore? But i'm still in pain. Great.

Remember when I was talking about getting spine surgery in 2021? I mentioned to him it could be cervical spine related. He said it does seem like it. So he prescribed an MRI. I received the results today : NOTHING.

Absolutely nothing showed up. On my shoulders, on my cervical spine. I'm so lost, because the pain has gradually gotten worse over the past like 4 months. These days I can barely stand to be in front of my PC to play some games for more than an hour. I don't even get out of my house except to go to PT because I know I will be in pain. We went christmas shopping just the other day and it was already awful just 30 minutes in. I like to write, and even this seems almost impossible for me, whether its on my laptop or my PC. It feels like i'm doing nothing of my days, and the fact i'm still unemployed is not helping either, though I can't imagine getting a job in the state i'm currently in.

I'm always in pain, can't do the things I love or used to love, I'm scared to go out for extended periods of time because I know it will be painful in the evening. The idea of family dinners during the christmas season depresses me because I know I will be in horrible pain quickly. I love to cook and even this has been taken away from me. It's taken away my joy in little things, writing, gaming, reading, exploring. I've been crying about it a lot. Because the pain is so constant. It feels like it will never get better. And nothing to relieve the pain works (i've tried cold/hot packs, paracetamol, anti-inflammatory meds) and I'm starting to get exhausted of everything. I even tried Chinese medicine (acupuncture) and it did not work. 

  
I also now have trouble falling asleep because the pain is just too much. I hate it here.

My life is basically centred around my bi-weekly PT appointments, and thats it. I'm exhausted, and I honestly feel like I'm starting to get depressed because of it.

So yeah, here was my story. Sorry it got so long, but I just needed to rant about it. I'm sending strength to all of y'all that are also suffering <3",1766436849.0,2,1,ChronicPain,mental_physical

Some people say a small panel is enough for joints, others say the bigger panels make a noticeable difference. Hard to tell what’s real and what’s a sales pitch.

Multiple amounts of urine tests, all normal. 
Chiropractor visits weekly for adjustments.
Multiple amounts of bloodwork.  All normal and negative for autoimmune diseases.
Multiple X-rays and MRI’s of the neck, full spine, pelvis, and SI joints.  Only had minor concerns in the neck and spine areas and mild arthritis in both SI joints. 
Pelvic floor therapy completed and all tissues are lose and normal. 
Had multiple steroid and lidocaine shots with no success.  
Had pain block in right SI joint with no success. 
Had surgery for endometriosis and it was found and removed. They removed my tubes at this time bc endo was covering them. 
I had precancerous cells in my cervix and had to have a full hysterectomy with ovaries removed. 
I just started massage therapy but I think this will take time to see if there are any positive results from tight muscles. 

Pain is still persistent.  Starts off in the right pelvis area then progresses to my buttock, and around to my hip flexor.  Sometimes to the back of my leg but just half way.  

Sitting makes the pain 10x worse. 
I use to be able to lay flat on my back to get some relief but this doesn’t work anymore.  I can’t lie on either side when sleeping and now sleeping on my back hurts.

1pt0ksv,“Just get a job” is such a minimizing thing to say to someone with chronic pain,"I’m so tired of being told to “just get a job” like it’s a magic fix.

ummmm?? It’s not that simple!

People say, “Jobs will work around health issues.” WHERE??

Genuinely. What job can I lie down on the clock? What job lets me disappear when my bones are screaming? Because right now I can’t even bathe myself without it being a whole ordeal.

what job will want an employee that cries once a day from their aches and pains.

I’m in constant agony. My bones ache. I’m extremely

depressed because the pain is nonstop. Showering is hard. Existing is hard. And somehow the solution people land on is: try harder.

I also have no experience, no hireability, and no magical resume. that guarantees me even an interview. my last job i was 18 and a hostess at a restaurant. (i’m 30 now)

now i use mobility devices lmao

and remote work isn’t some guaranteed thing you can just grab??? like most people had to earn those positions.

or “you’re gonna be in pain either way, might as well get paid!”

“just do things in pain!”

and i just. i want to scream

What hurts the most is how minimizing it is.

getting a job would absolutely destroy the remainder of my body. my body is already running on fumes.

I’m NOT choosing this.

plus,i’d be such an unreliable employee, i’d call in sick so much??

All I said was that moving out, having a job, and having a partner feel unattainable for me. That I feel left behind. And the response was basically: you’re not trying hard enough.

1psscw8,Anyone Experienced Similar?,"Looking to see if anyone might have experienced similar and have suggestions I got discuss further with my doctors as we are currently stumped on what to look at next. A referral to a rheumatologist is open but is 6+ months out. 

--

I have had Crohn's long term and been on biologics over 10 years. Most of that was on Remicade however in March 2025 I was forced to switch to a biosimilar, Renflexis for insurance/cost/non-medical reasons. My issues started about that same time. 

In February I was on vacation the full month. I was in the gym for an hour plus most days working on conditioning for a upper leg issue connected to a permanent physical injury. Towards the end of that month I was feeling the least I had in quite some time. 

In March that suddenly changed. The main presentation is joint pain for unexplained causes. It has settled to my hands but I have felt it in my neck/skull, elbow, knees, feet and maybe elsewhere. The majority of the time it seems to be like a switch turns on and a strong flare of pain happens then roughly 15 minutes later it goes away. Sometimes one, say a hand, stops hurting and instantly something else hurts like a foot. 

Another important note on the pain is it doesn't seem to be strictly joints as a fee instances have been observed where it is in tendons that are not on a joint such as about an inch (2 cm) below my elbow. 

It's been fairly conclusively determined by my PCP and GI at this point it is not rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's, minerals/vitamins, a reaction to the biologic, and gluten. 

The idea it could be gluten came about while fasting for a colonoscopy and symptoms started to clear up some. Having previously done food journalling for Crohn's this feels different. I later travelled to an area where corn effectively does not exist in the diet. I do drink lots of soda with HFCS (corn) and corn is a common additive to processed foods in North America. The challenge here is I am told there is no test for that. Also it doesn't fully explain why this happened as my diet did not change. 

Truly hoping someone might have heard of something similar and have advice on what I can discuss with my doctors as possible next steps. ",1766384113.0,3,3,ChronicPain,mental_physical

Also miserable at breakfast because the back of the chair was a booth with hardwood backing. Then I don’t even know why I was miserable at dinner tonight.

1pslnrt,One of those days.,"Hi, I just wanted to vent and feel like the person I usually vent to is distancing themselves because I’m so miserable. My birthday is on Wednesday and my mom has a doctor appt tomorrow. I drive her to her appointments. She lives far away so I drive from my place to hers, coming back we pass my place and go further down the highway, then all the way back to her place and then I drive home. By the drive home I am dying in pain to the point that my right leg will start shaking because it wants to seize up and stop functioning (my mom’s brake is too far to the left so it wrecks my knee reaching over then into my thigh, high, and into my lumbar). So before these long treks from hell I have to take it easy so I don’t compound the pain. 

Sometimes I show up in my pajamas because I couldn’t handle showering first or getting dressed pain and time wise. It’s amazing how much more time everything takes when you’re in pain. 

Anyway, my plan today was to clear some boxes and paper bags because my dog chased a mouse into the house and it liked the boxes and bags. Then I was going to clean the bathroom and shower. Then change my sheets. Any one of these activities alone puts me in so much pain that my lumbar seizes up but I just had Covid so my place is gross and I just wanted it to be cleanish for my birthday, at least the bathroom. Then shower tonight so I didn’t have to tomorrow. 

Well, I did laundry and went to change it to the dryer. The machine had danced away from the drain sink and the drain hose came out of the sink and flooded the basement. On double rinse. So now if I do the rest of my plan I know I’ll be dying tomorrow then compound the drive on top of that and I’ll be blown up like the Violet from Willy Wonka and miserable. 

 This was so long and so boring. But I’m just so fucking sick of being in pain. I wish I could remember what it was like before but I don’t think I’ve ever been comfortable due to undiagnosed EDS and auDHD as a kid until 37. I wish I could shower without having to take meds, wait, plan out when, dread it immensely due to the pain I’ll be in afterwards for two days. Ugh and forget drying my fucking hair, the pain sweats with the heat…may as well shower again. 

And fuck seeing all the amazing doctors my algorithm keeps showing me but they’re all states or countries away and thus far all the doctors I’ve dealt with have just given me major medical anxiety. Because I’m a woman with tattoos so clearly I couldn’t possibly actually hurt from my many visible issues on MRIs. I’m just depressed and wondering what the point of living this way is. Honestly right now my pain is the least of my issues which is saying something for how life is going currently. I hate the holidays now and used to love them as a Christmas Eve birthday.

Do opioids usually work right away, or do you need to take them for weeks to notice any effect? I always thought they were supposed to work pretty fast, especially for pain. My MRI and all other exams are clear.

If even opioids don’t help my chronic low back pain, am I screwed? The next step would probably be something stronger, like morphine, maybe oxycodone or even fentanyl patches. And if none of that works either, it honestly feels like I’m completely fucked.

At this point it almost feels redundant to list everything I’ve tried, but yes, I’ve gone through acupuncture, chiropractic care, massages, physical therapy of every kind, alternative treatments, supplements, injections, diet, you name it. I didn’t just try them once or half-heartedly, I really gave them a proper shot. None of it made a meaningful dent in the pain. That’s what makes this so discouraging, it’s not a lack of effort or options, it’s that nothing seems to touch it.",1766354161.0,12,135,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1psi30r,Anyone ever dealt with medication struggles?,"I know the title is super vague. I'll explain in more detail and I apologize if some of this rant doesn't make sense. I'm super emotional. 
So I've seen my Doctor for like 13 years. Things have been mostly okay until a little over a year ago when I had a bad back injury. We had to start changing meds and stuff. Not a problem. Fast forward to the tail end of this summer. Meds aren't great, I'm trying to get by. I mentioned things aren't working. She says I'm already on a lot of meds for fibromyalgia. Which, yes IF, big IF, my only issue was my fibro. My back has been a constant issue, I had slme other stuff that required surgery, I broke my foot (it was broken for 2 months before I was brave enough to go into the ER. I kept telling people but no one did anything to check it.)
Ever since at least October Ive been having to constantly do ""medication gymnastics"" to get by and function. We didnt up my meds to help with the broken foot (before or after). I have a 5 year old who does daily therapy, goes to school and is VERY high energy. I dont have the ability to just ""rest and heal"". The house work, school and therapy and appointments are all on me. So I've taken extra meds to get things done and have gotten into the terrible cycle I can't get myself out of where I either have my immediate pain meds or long acting but never both at the same time. 
If I tell my doctor would they kick me off my medicine? Do they help you fix the shitty cycle? I'm terrified of being labeled as a drug seeker or addict. I've never missed  a pill count or failed a drug test (its my clinics policy) I've never asked for more meds or cause any trouble before. I just need advice or something.

So last year April I started having really bad pains in the stomach, lost a lot of weight and the runs and nausea constantly. Took 6 months of testing but was diagnosed with IBS. 

This year in April (April must be a bad omen for me) I was at work on a pick ripping out plants and I fractured my spine. I had an MRI and X-ray which showed spinal fracture with pars defect. This ended my gardening career and was the start of what’s been a total overturn of my life 😞

About a month after that I started getting severe hip pain, just left hip, that my doctor said would subside once my spinal Injury was less inflamed. 

One morning in July, I woke up and couldn’t move my neck, I was in so much pain for days that I went back to doctors who sent me for a MRI. 

The results showed 3 bulging discs and open nerve endings. 

Cut to now and my hip pain is so excruciating that I limp. I need to go for another ultrasound and MRI after Christmas. 

I have constant pain, between the spinal injury, neck,hip and my stomach issues. 

But I am always so tired! I used to be full of energy, extroverted and happy. Now I just feel miserable and depressed. I feel like I’m a burden on my family because I always have to lay down due to pain and fatigue. 

What do all of you do that really helps? 

I refuse to take pain meds, I will take Panadol for work but that’s it. 

Swimming, yoga, physio??? 

Please, any advice would be much appreciated.

1psecfy,Friend with chronic pain is in a compromising situation and I'm at a loss,"[POSSIBLE TRIGGERS AHEAD]

Friend has Lyme, Fibro, Dystonia and a bunch of stuff doctors diagnose differently every year it seems. He can barely walk 10 feet without being out of breath.

Recently a lifelong friend was kind enough to let him move in with her, even sayin ""I want take care of you, you're non-negotiable to me"". Up until then he lived on a farm where his family absolutely could not take care of him (farm). At the exact same time she got involved with a volatile manipulator (not prior history) who imposes himself on her decisions surrounding my friend with chronic pain.

Friend with chronic pain is recovering from a 3 year long abusive relationship (physical impositions, nonconsent, ""you'll never find anyone else willing to out up with you"") where there was zero closure in his favor. 

Dealing with this aggressive imposition is souring the peace in the house and my buddy has no interpersonal emotional skills so he doesn't know how to be diplomatic when his body's in fight or flight and he's just one big flayed nerve.

Other than her I'm the only lifeline he's got and he was fixing to end things living back on that farm. I can't house him and he's scared his inability to handle this situation is going to get him sent back there.

How does a person with chronic pain effectively communicate their boundaries to their support when their support is volatile at best? Bonus question: How in the hell can he take care of himself on 300 dollar a month disability (MD)? What kind of job can someone who can barely move or speak, depending on the day, even get?

1psbszp,I’m trying something new,"I’ve decided to do something that’s potentially stupid but also potentially really helpful. I have 4 regular pain meds I take everyday on somewhat of a schedule as my doctor recommended. I also take 1 very strong form of pain relief when I’m in extreme pain or at night if my pain is severely impacting my sleep. Realistically I know I need this strong medicine way more than my doctor wants me to take it (want is very important) I can as instructed take it periodically throughout the day as instructions state. So if I’m having a flare up I could take it multiple times a day.

With that in mind I tend to avoid taking, I save it for activities or things that I’m doing that I know I’ll need it for eg a day out or when I moved house, that kind of thing. Im in agony daily but I tend to just “try to take it as late as possible” which (as a nurse) I know is not a good way to manage pain. Pain meds work best when you keep your pain low down. I wrote a whole guide for helping people manage their pain just because I care deeply about not letting people suffer like I do. Anyway I didn’t share this guide.

Basically, I’m going to take my stronger meds semi regularly. If I’m in lots of pain and I’m struggling I’m just going to take it. After work I’m debilitated so I’m going to bring it with me to take in the uber home since I can’t take the meds during work. I’ve been paying attention to my signs of worsening pain and I plan to take my meds before the pain gets to kick in full force.

Where this might be stupid is my supply, I actually have no idea how frequently my doctors would prescribe me this medication but I tend to follow my own guide and I ask for it every 6-8weeks depending on how much I’ve needed. I am willing to have like a 3-4 weeks of almost no pain to have 3-4 weeks of really bad pain. My concerns are:

1. This will work and I’ll become obsessed with not being in awful pain like on top of the world happiness which will then turn into depression far worse

 than before when I run out.

2. Once I run out I go through mega withdrawals. 

There’s probably more but I just don’t know feel like it’s worth trying. I’m pretty hopeless at the moment I feel like I’ll never be comfortable again. It’s been so bad lately I’ve genuinely contemplated not sticking around if you get what I mean so yeah I’ll do anything.

1psb1ju,Possibly stupid question: Has anyone put the lid back on pandora's box?,"Sorry, this is part pity party, part genuine question: has anyone gone off a medication to try something else, opened up a whole host of new problems, gone back to the old meds, and  not had to deal the new problems again?

What happened is that I was on an antidepressant, amitriptyline 25mg, for a little over a year and a half and I wanted to get off of anti depressants ( I didn't feel like it made much of a difference, it made me keep weight which hurt my self esteem, it was always a problem when prescribing other meds, etc) so that I could finally try stimulant ADHD meds and hopefully that would address a lot of the sources of my anxiety and depression issues. I also suffer from migraines but for the most part I only suffered twice a month. Ibuprofen, dark room rest, and water worked fine. 

I got off the amitriptyline, started the stimulants and ran into some new/other problems. Without getting into the all the details, and the whole 4 months worth of problems, laundry list of different meds, crying sessions, vision changes, doctors visits, etc, I have developed neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia. I didn't have that before. It just seemed like my migraines were changing in nature and my new doctor's that I've never needed before were not really interested in finding a source just treating. Two different doctor's, two different meds,: topirimate and gabapentin. I fucking HATE the gabapentin. it's been a bigger pain in the ass than a help.

I feel so unheard and misunderstood with my new doctors that I've never had to deal with before. I've never felt more like a hypochondriac and an invalid in my life and I just graduated and started a very stressful and demanding job in a new city with no one to help me with good insurance which was why I thought I could make this transition.

From what I've read, there is no cure for neuralgia but what do you know...a treatment for neuropathy and neuralgia.... amitriptyline 10mg...THIS WHOLE TIME. 

I knew that it was possible that I could relapse into anxiety and depression HARD after coming off an antidepressant for a year and I was willing to work my way through that with the issues that I had. I was NOT prepared for the blitzkrieg of medical issues that I have had to deal with. I had no indication that this was something waiting underneath. No prior hx of it, NOTHING.

It's possible this little pill that I've resented and wanted to get off of to try and live an easier/better life with therapy and easier stimulants may have been the lynch pin holding a pandora's box of worse neurological problems I didn't know were waiting for me, and now I can never close again.

But this neuralgia thing SUCKS SO MUCH I would rather have the weight back etc etc if it means I never have to deal with it again. 

I know I should ask a medical professional and I WILL but there've been so... not very conversational ??? and google and ai are fucking useless that I thought I'd try asking more of a crowd.

Seeking ideas/advice for what could be wrong.

Hiii, my primary care doctor, rheumatologist, PT, etc. all have no more ideas on what tests, or conditions to even look for, so I thought I'd come and ask here to see if anyone has a similar condition or any advice.

(Apologies for the formatting, it looks fine when I edit or post, I don't use reddit often enough to know why the bullet points aren't working how they should)

I was thinking my next step is a specialty clinic like Mayo, but I don't have savings for something like that, especially being unable to work because of my condition. :/ 

Backstory of when my pain started: I was 12 when it first started and it's gotten worse ever since. I was very athletic in middle school running a 5:45 Mile, and being team captain on wrestling and football. It started out as just a sharp pain when I ran, and progressed from there in my hands and hips, in 9th grade I finally had to stop because my pain got too bad. Highschool was awful as I often wouldn't sleep for 48 hours due to the pain from having to walk between classes and being active during the school hours. I'm now 23 and it's progressed to the point where getting around is hard, sleeping is hard, and doing anything for any length of time is a challenge.

My symptoms:
• Chronic bilateral hip pain that never goes away.

• SI joint tender and painful,

• Front of hips painful and tender.

• Difficulty and pain lifting legs whilst walking,

• Excruciating pain in SI area while laying on my back,

• Swollen and painful joints in my hands, and polyarthralgia in my palms and wrists, 

• Firm touch like poking hurts much more than it should, sometimes for days after, 

• Worse back and hip pain if I sit for too long(30+ minutes)

• Worse back and hip pain if I stand for too long(15+ minutes)

• IBS

• Depression

•CPTSD

• Keloids on back and shoulders.

• GERD.

• Insomnia because of pain.

• Extra pain will persist for about a week after a strenuous activity, such as walking for an hour or bowling, etc.

• Pain fluctuates between sharp and burning, sometimes sharp when I do something strenuous, sometimes sharp for no reason.

Possible relevant info:
• I was born 8 weeks early.

• My Dad and stepdad were abusive growing up.

• I'm 5'5"" 23m, 198lbs, was 170lbs when pain started(170 is healthy for me I have a stocky build, I was benching 225lbs and running a sub 6 minute mile at 170)


Test I've had:
• About 20 MRI's of my back, hips, etc:
All found nothing abnormal aside from some disc bulging in my lower back. 

• About 25 x-rays of my back, hips, hands, etc:
Found possible issues with my femoral heads being deformed, and the gap between my hip bone and femur being too narrow, but after further consult these were ruled out.

• Physical Therapy:
Each time they've worked with me, they've said my condition is rapidly getting worse and that they need more information because whatever they're doing is making me worse.

• I've asked my doctor about getting tested for: 
Myofascial pain syndrome,
Berlottis's Syndrome,
Spina bifida occulta,
Piriformis Syndrome
Pelvic congestion syndrome
He went through the symptoms with me and didn't feel as though I should be tested for them.

Specific conditions I've been seen or tested for:
• Sacroiliitis,
• CRPS,
• Autoimmune conditions,
• Fibromyalgia,
• Arthritis,
• SI Joint Dysfunction 

I've had consults or visit with these specialists:

• Pain clinic for any ideas of conditions like CRPS, he said I don't have any markers.

• Rheumatologist about 5 times: I have positive ANA markers in my blood, but they haven't found any autoimmune issues, or had any recommendations.

• Physiatrist: Said I just need to use an exercise bike, so I did for about a year, extremely painful, no improvement and condition continued to get worse.

• Neurologist to see if I have nerve damage: 
I can feel the pen everywhere they poked it, so they said that's not the issue.

• A PSOAS treatment facility: No improvement.

• Orthopedics about 30 times: No ideas that got past the second opinion phase.


Medications or treatments I've tried: 

• Cymbalta: No improvement, made me very suicidal.

• Gabapentin
- No improvement, made me feel very lethargic.

• Muscle relaxer(forgot name), didn't help with pain but made it so I couldn't move. 

• Lexapro
- Made me very suicidal.

• Various anti inflammatory medications over the years(forgot names)
- No improvement, just gave me IBS.

• Steroid injections in my hip socket, and SI joints.
- Excruciating pain for weeks after, no improvement.

• Marijuana:
- Tried a few different kinds for pain, no improvement, unenjoyable experience for me.

Thank you if you made it this far, you're amazing and I appreciate it!<3

1ps38ye,10 years of neck nerve pain stopping me from exercising - success stories?,"Has anyone actually made progress with mild to moderate cervical radiculopathy? I'm stuck in a frustrating cycle and looking for people who've been where I am.

**The trap I'm in**

I need to exercise to stay healthy, but every time I try anything beyond walking and core work, I trigger a cervical radiculopathy flare up. The nerve pain makes my desk job unbearable, even with good ergonomics. So I back off the exercise to manage work pain, but then my overall health suffers. It's been this way for years.

**How it started**

About 10 years ago (around age 30), I injured something while squatting. Never got it checked out because the pain was manageable - just intermittent flare ups every few months. I switched from weights to running and figured I was fine. Classic mistake.

Fast forward to last year. Work got intense, lots of desk time. Pulled an all-nighter and got a terrible flare up. Desperate, I found a YouTube video of some ""expert"" claiming you could fix a pinched nerve by leaning into the painful side to ""slot the disc back."" I know, I know. McGill would have my head.

Here's the weird part: it actually changed something. The pain moved location and initially felt better. But now it's more constant and easier to trigger. Before, I'd get complete relief between episodes. Now? Never fully goes away.

**What I'm doing now**

Currently following McGill's approach (though he focuses more on lumbar issues). Daily routine includes:

* McGill Big 3 for core (these helped me catch sciatica early and prevent it)
* Glute bridges
* Walking
* Cervical spine hygiene (careful head positioning, limited desk time)
* One specific neck exercise: tongue on roof of mouth, press chin down on fist for isometric hold

That last one might be working. After a few weeks, my neck feels maybe 10-15% more resilient. Small win, but I'll take it.

**Where I'm stuck**

1. Chin tucks - Every PT seems to recommend these for cervical radiculopathy. They say it's about proper head alignment. But for me, they feel completely unnatural and have triggered small flare ups. My neck has adapted to nearly 40 years of life, including years of desk work. Is forcing it into ""proper"" alignment even realistic at this point? Or should I work with the structure I've got?
2. How much discomfort is okay? - McGill says exercise when pain-free, but with the neck, that's rare. How much should I push through? What's productive discomfort vs harmful?
3. The thoracic connection - I've read that you can't fix cervical issues without addressing the thoracic spine first. The neck sits on it, after all. Anyone have experience with this approach?

**My realistic goal**

I don't expect miracles. I just want to do some light exercise (easy squats, push ups, maybe light jogging) without constantly triggering flare ups. And if they happen, I want them milder. I want to weaken this deterrent that's keeping me from living my life.

**Looking for**

* People who've successfully used neck isometrics for radiculopathy
* Thoughts on the chin tuck dilemma for those of us with adapted forward posture
* Experience with thoracic exercises as foundation for cervical improvement
* Realistic timelines (this is slow going and I need perspective)

Been dealing with this for a decade. Ready to put in the work if there's actually a path forward. What's worked for you?

ive lost hope. i see myself in a few years having my own apartment where i just never leave. maybe occasionally to buy something here and there but i am deteriorating. i am in my bed almost constantly. even hobbies i do in bed cause pain. there is pain *everywhere*. im a 20 year old who walks around with a cane and pain medication everywhere, yet still gets bedridden after a small trip to the store.

1prwpza,Parent with chronic pain who seems to be giving up,"So my Dad has been dealing with chronic pain in his joints the past few years that is getting more and more severe (he's been diagnosed with hyper thyroidism, psuedo gout and we know there is something else happening but so far no one knows what.) He was always a super active person and now of course with the pain it's significantly impacting his quality of life. He also just retired a few months ago, and because of his health he's not physically able to do any of the things he had wanted to do in retirement. He also doesn't have a social life other than my Mom, who still works full time.

So understandably, he's depressed and struggling. He's refusing to see a therapist, he's refusing support groups, he's refusing trying new hobbies, we can't even get him to go to any kind of doctor (he's gone to a few that all have either not been able to diagnose him or have misdiagnosed him, so he seems to have decided no one can help him because they couldn't.) I understand feeling hopeless, but it feels like he's just giving up and it's very scary for my whole family. We've all for years tried everything we could think of to help support and encourage him but nothing works. It's like he wants help but if it's not an immediate, quick and full fix he's not at all interested (which ofc doesn't exist.)

It's extremely painful and scary to watch him in so much pain, both physically and emotionally. I don't know what to do anymore and I'm scared things are only going to get worse. I'm wondering if there is anyone here who has gone through something similar with a loved one who might have some advice? We're pretty desperate for any ideas for ways to encourage him not to just give up.

\*edit: I really appreciate everyone's responses and insights. I don't at all intend to sound insensitive to what he's going through, I know this is harder for him than it is for us. I'm grateful for the advice and perspectives you all have shared",1766288314.0,15,29,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1prvly4,Traveling with chronic pain is what hell is made of.,"28F I have chronic bowel issues (ibs is my only diagnosis for now but working on getting the pain better addressed) and I have permanent Endo issues even after a hysterectomy. 

The last time I traveled internationally was in 2019 to Italy when my pain was much less. Now it's 2025 and I'm on my honeymoon in Japan. It has been flare after flare. Exhaustion from constantly having to find safe foods or safe activities to do without aggravating my bowels. Im also recovering from the flu and a double ear infection meaning I have antibiotics to take and that means more stomach pain. 

I underestimated how much fucking pain I would be in. I have cried every day about wanting to go home. If I could afford to change my flight I would. My husband is as understanding as he can be but he wants to go explore and I'm telling him just to go alone. I need to take my meds and lay in bed.

Also I couldnt bring medical cannabis here with me which is the only thing that helps me at home and I didn't want to bring opioids so I am stuck with only anti spasm meds for my stomach. 

I love the anime stuff and history. I really do. But all I want to do is binge shop at an anime store see the imperial palace is GO HOME.

Edit: thank you for the kind comments and suggestions. I appreciate you all. Someone finally gets it. My husband is being as supportive as he can and did all of our laundry and let me cry all afternoon and got me something safe (I hope) for dinner.

1prlfmv,Neck pain that always turns into headaches + forward head posture: anyone fixed this long-term?,"I’m a 42-year-old male with decades of recurring neck pain that reliably turns into headaches. It always starts at the base of my skull (suboccipital trigger points). If I don’t stop it there, a tension-type headache follows.

I have classic forward head posture / nerd neck. Sitting upright without back support is difficult: my shoulders round, upper back hunches, and my head drops quickly.

Over the last 10 years the frequency has increased. I usually need painkillers at least once a week, and I’ve had recurring flare-ups lasting days or weeks. Freestyle swimming helped a lot, but I can’t do it right now due to a recent shoulder surgery, and since then everything has gotten worse.

Trigger point pressure (lying on a mat and pressing the suboccipital area with my fingers) often helps temporarily and sometimes prevents the headache, but I have to repeat it multiple times a day, and eventually it stops working.

Has anyone with the same pattern (neck pain first, forward head posture) managed to break this cycle long-term?

**Edit:** One thing that really confuses me: whenever I try to train in my home gym, I almost always end up with neck pain followed by headaches. I’ve tested this very deliberately.

Most recently, I did only a single pull-up (because this seems to trigger it the most). And even that one single pull-up is enough to almost 100% reliably trigger neck pain and then a headache.

1prj5a4,Severe Pain 2 weeks After Lumbar/Sacral Facet Injections???,"I'm not sure if anybody has had this experience before but I am desperate and the doctors aren't taking me seriously.

To begin, I have several medical diagnoses but these are focused on my back: Fibromyalgia, Sciatica, Degenerative Disc Disease (thoracic to sacral), Facet Disease (lumbar/sacral), arthritis, cysts, & slipped/bulging discs at every level (thoracic to sacrum).

I finally got in to see a spine surgeon a month ago. He suggested I do X-ray guided facet injections in my lumbar/sacral region as that's the area the pain/numbness was the worst. It was typically severe only when standing for 10 minutes or more which really hindered work and raising kids etc.

On December 1st I went for the injections. No complications at the time but also no relief. Everything went as usual besides the leg pain. That subsided. This is now a breakdown of the last week of hell:

•On the 14th (2 weeks to the day) I started getting pain down my left leg/foot more than usual. While in church I need some ankle stretches on my left foot (had surgery 2 years ago with its own complications). Pain/numbness reduced to a tolerable level.

•Monday the 15th I woke up to severe 9/10 lower back pain right where the injections were given. The pain was so back sitting hurt, standing and bending were excruciating and it just made the entire day a write off.

•Between Tuesday and yesterday it just kept getting worse. Yesterday I also started getting spasms (a Charlie horse) on top of the pain. It took my breath away. Caused me nausea and made me yelp. I usually have a very high pain tolerance but OMG! The only thing that helped was during the spasms were using my arms and lifting my body to relieve pressure. On top of that my entire lower back and leg are now numb. This is the point I contacted the surgeon's office.

Note: Between Monday and yesterday I tried muscle relaxers, 600mg advil, Percocet, a heating pad, and a prescribed muscle cream. No relief whatsoever.

The surgeon had me drive the hour to come see him yesterday but TBH was absolutely useless. I got no answers, but rather got a half dozen plus guesses:

Doesn't think it's an infection because it's been 2 weeks but didn't want to do any additional tests or injections in case it is an infection.... My ""body is so large"" that the doctor may have struggled with the initial injection causing the site to swell and put pressure (which yes I've gained weight since my surgery but this was an image guided injection . Not the DR going in blind)..... The site could have had a slow bleed inside that over two weeks pooled inside and into the muscle causing the pain and pressure..... It's my old issue resurfacing (it was never this bad more did it ever fully go away).... I pushed myself to hard after the injection and hurt myself (my activity wasn't anything out of the usual).... A bulging disc may have gotten worse however this is a long shot... And just another handful of various things without actually trying to solve it or figure out some productive pain management. He then told me he's leaving after this appointment for a 2 week vacation so I'm ""welcome to come back in a week to see his colleague"" and there the appointment ended and they rebooked me for Christmas Eve.

I don't know if I should just go to the hospital or what is causing it or what I can do but it's not getting better...only worse. I'm barely sleeping and the pain is just ridiculous. I can't even bend to throw my hair in a pony let alone manage the house and work and 5 teenagers.

Any suggestions or guidance would help. I know you all aren't doctors. I'm just looking for anyone who has had a similar experience.

Thank you so much!!

1prj1ne,Advice on going to university? (and venting),"Hi everyone, I’m not sure if I really “count” but I don’t have anyone else to talk to who’d understand. 
I’ve been feeling pain in my fingers/ wrists, and sometimes up to my elbows for over a year now. Recently my knees and ankles have started hurting too (not sure if they’re related). I've been told by doctors it probably won’t last forever since I’m young and otherwise healthy but after a while it gets harder to believe. It hasn’t been with me long and it’s not very debilitating (2-7 on the pain scale depending on the day), but it’s getting hard to live with. I don’t even know what’s causing it. 
I’ll be graduating high school pretty soon and all I’ve been hearing about lately is university and what everyone will do after graduating. All of my friends will be moving to another city for university and I really want to go with them, but don’t know if I can handle the workload or living alone. 
I’ve already been having trouble with keeping up with schoolwork and living in general. I’m constantly flipping between feeling guilty about what I can’t do and wanting to overwork myself to compensate (which makes my pain worse). But doing nothing isn’t an option, so it feels like I’m just hurting myself for no reason. 
I also miss having hobbies. Everything I used to do (drawing, writing, sewing, crochet especially) involved repetitive movements in my hands/wrists which is the reason I’m in pain in the first place. It’s probably my fault and maybe I could have done something to prevent it but it just feels like a punishment for doing anything productive. 
But about university, I thought about taking a gap year and moving there to just work until I hopefully feel better. But most of my options for work would probably involve constantly using my hands. And I could stay where I am, but I’d rather not live with my family for longer than I have to.
I know graduation is a big change and all, but I genuinely can’t see where I would go from here. And I really don’t want to lose my social circle since they’re what helps me get out of bed in the morning. 
Sorry I’m mostly venting, it’s gotten worse as it’s colder outside and I’ll have to deal with exams soon. 
TLDR: I have chronic hand pain and I want to move out and go to university but I don’t know if I can physically/mentally handle it.
But yeah, if anyone has any advice on what I should do or maybe ways to cope day to day, I appreciate it.

1prb7q7,Inflammatory back pain – I don’t know what to do anymore,"TLDR:

30F, 2 years of severe night-time back pain with morning stiffness, better with movement, worse with rest. HLA-B27 positive, father had ankylosing spondylitis, MRIs so far “normal.” Doctors dismiss it as muscular. Feeling unheard and desperate — looking for advice / similar experiences

Hi everyone,

I’m a 30-year-old woman and I’ve been dealing with severe back pain for almost two years now. I’m slowly reaching my breaking point and hope someone here might recognize these symptoms or know what direction I should go next.

About the pain:

The pain is worst at night. During the second half of the night I wake up with intense pain in my upper back, around the thoracic spine. It feels like everything is burning — from my shoulder blades into my chest and ribs. Sometimes it’s so bad that breathing becomes difficult. The only thing that helps is getting up and moving around.

For the past few weeks, I’ve also started having pain in my hands occasionally.

When I get up in the morning, my spine feels extremely stiff, almost like it will never loosen up again — but after about 30 minutes it improves significantly. During the day I’m often almost pain-free, but in the evening or when I don’t move much for a longer time, the pain comes back.

Lifestyle / what I’m doing already:

I do mobility exercises every day (10–30 minutes).

I go to the gym twice a week.

I have a 10-month-old daughter and go for walks with her almost daily.

For a while this helped and the pain came in flares, but for some time now it’s been more or less constant — sometimes manageable, sometimes much worse.

I don’t smoke, don’t drink alcohol, and I’m not sedentary. We mostly cook fresh and fairly healthy meals.

Medical history / examinations:

I’ve seen multiple orthopedists. They looked at my spine and ordered an MRI to rule out a herniated disc. Since my discs were mostly unremarkable, I was told repeatedly: “It’s probably muscular, just exercise more.”

I mentioned every single time that my father had ankylosing spondylitis (Morbus Bechterew). This was dismissed with “You probably don’t have that.”

Unfortunately, I never felt taken seriously — and since I’m not extremely slim, I also have the feeling doctors just assume I must have an unhealthy lifestyle, which is not true.

After breaking down crying in front of my primary care doctor because the pain has been affecting me mentally so much, I finally got an appointment with a rheumatologist.

He confirmed that I am HLA-B27 positive. However, since my MRI so far hasn’t shown clear inflammatory lesions, he said there isn’t enough evidence for a rheumatologic disease and ended the evaluation.

The problem is: I’m always examined during the day, when I’m relatively mobile and in much less pain. Due to daily mobility exercises, I can even bend forward and touch the floor with my hands. When my back is tapped or examined, I barely react because daytime pain is mild.

How this affects me mentally:

I feel completely dismissed and like no one is really trying to find out what’s wrong with me.

During the day I already fear the coming night, which probably makes me tense up even more and worsens things psychosomatically. I’ve developed anxiety because I’m only 30 and terrified of living like this for the rest of my life.

I honestly don’t know what to do anymore.

If this sounds familiar to anyone, or if someone knows what kind of specialist, tests, or next steps I should pursue, I would be incredibly grateful.

I live in Germany, so treatments and healthcare systems may differ, but any advice is welcome.

Thank you so much to anyone who read this long post — I truly didn’t know how to make it shorter.",1766225999.0,10,18,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1praey6,One tiny piece of tree bark,"3 years ago, I rolled my left ankle pretty badly. Tried all the basics, then got basic orthotics, changed my shoes and so on. Didn’t see much improvement.

New gp in August sent me for an ultrasound which confirmed a torn ATFL, effusions. So I tried a new podiatrist - who does extra corporeal shockwave treatment, actually gives you physical therapy exercises, provides taping. Awesome! So I go from 2 weekly to monthly ECSW treatments, work on the exercises, overall pain is so much better. Pain in that ankle goes from like an 8 to a 3-4. 

Well what did I do 2 days ago? While walking my dog, I stepped on a small piece of tree bark and promptly rolled that ankle. It’s aching, burning, swelled back up again. Basically back to square one I’m guessing. 

This has got to be one of the more frustrating parts of chronic pain is the fact it can be so easy to exacerbate certain pain in an acute way again.

I have agonising back and knee pain. No matter what position I sleep in, I am in pain. This pain never leaves. I recently found out I have Overpronation (flat feet) and that was “fixed” with custom insoles but it didn’t make a difference to my pain, despite everything being the correct size and fit. 

I have become an insomniac. Scared of going to bed because I am never comfy. I do eventually fall asleep but I wake up a mere five hours later due to how sore and uncomfortable I am. I haven’t slept correctly in years, and it’s stolen everything from me. I can’t think, concentrate, focus or hold a conversation. I’m extremely irritable and I have this constant drunk feeling in my head that’s likely from the constant sleep deprivation. 

I don’t know what to do. My doctors don’t know what to do. I’ve tried everything I can think of. I have slept on my back, I’ve slept sitting up, I’ve slept with more pillows, less pillows, pillows between my legs, I’ve slept on a reclining armchair instead of a bed, I’ve changed my mattress and wasted money doing so…

My “death grip” is ruining my life. It’s not actually an extremely tight grip, I just subconsciously stiffen all of my muscles I think. No matter what I’m doing, using a computer mouse, holding my phone, using a utensil (writing, painting, drawing, sewing, completing paperwork, etc), crocheting, my hands always hurt. It’s my palms (and sometimes outermost area in the inner wrist). I’ve tried to look up exercises, but they’re all for specific medical conditions and don’t help (massage, ice, rest, stretch, etc.). I’m pretty sure the cause of this is that I don’t know how to relax my muscles, but I have no idea how to avoid stiffening my muscles when working with my hands.

I made one for 12/30-the soonest they had. i informed her I’d need a refill before said appt-to which she said no problem. Today after calling all week for my refill I’m informed at 4:39 that the Dr will not be refilling my medication until my appointment on 12/30.

I remember one morning going in with severe pain and as soon as the final injection in my knee was done, it was like all of the pain just disappeared. I was on the verge of tears and I couldn't help but profusely thank my pain specialist. A reduction in pain for 4-5 days out of the week is a huge improvement with the TPI and butrans combination.

I know that a lot of pain doctors push these on patients, but if you haven't tried them, I would highly recommend giving it a try.

1pqujq5,Your pain is real,"“Living in a body that hurts every day is something most people will never
understand. Chronic pain, fatigue, autoimmune issues, nerve pain, migraines, flare ups that appear out
of nowhere. It does not matter what the diagnosis is. When your body fights you, every part of life gets  harder in ways nobody sees.

People see you functioning, smiling, showing up. They do not see the nights you cannot sleep, the mornings you cannot move, or the energy it takes just to act normal.
They do not see how isolating it feels when your symptoms are invisible. 

You are not weak for needing rest.
You are not dramatic for saying you hurt. You are carrying a level of pain and exhaustion that would break many people, yet you still get up and try again.

Some days you can function. Some days you cannot. None of this is your fault. Your pain is real. Your effort is enormous even when no one sees it. You are not a burden.
You do not owe anyone an apology for surviving something they have never lived through.

I see you. Keep going.”

1pqpx2q,Very soft cushion or chair recommendations? (Back/ pelvic pain),"Hi friends,



I have very bad low back, sacroilliac, and coccyx pain as well as pelvic floor dysfunction. My flare-up triggers are sitting, standing, and walking. Sitting is by far the worst trigger, but I do have a couple surfaces that I can tolerate sitting on. 



The most comfortable position for me to do work in is sitting up propped up by pillows in my bed. While relatively comfortable, this makes me less productive and disrupts my sleep hygiene. My bed has a 3-inch, extremely soft gel memory foam mattress pad. It’s very, very soft — it took me at least a week to get used to it when I first got it. Another surface that I can tolerate sitting on for longer periods of time is my parents’ saggy old couch. I have no idea why very soft surfaces are the most comfortable for me since the advice is to sit somewhere with a lot of lumbar support, but it works. 



I already have a very nice “ergonomic” and supportive desk chair that was specifically recommended to me by an occupational therapist for my back pain, but unfortunately it still gives me massive flare-ups. I also already have a coccyx pillow, but it’s too firm and still flared everything up, including the coccyx pain. 



Does anybody know where I can find either: 

* A very overly soft chair cushion, or 
* An overly cushioned desk chair that would feel like a soft couch? ",1766162804.0,2,3,ChronicPain,mental_physical

1pqolsi,"flat protrusion at C5/6, left-sided portion with slight narrowing of the neuroforamen","Hello everyone,
I want to share my problem that has been with me continuously since May 2024. I really hope that someone has had similar symptoms or can give me advice that might help.
I apologize in advance for sharing this post in multiple Reddit groups. I am desperate and feel really bad both physically and mentally.

About me
Male, 28 years old
Self employed, working almost exclusively from home
Spend a lot of time sitting at my desk, but try to balance sitting and standing
Definitely missing regular exercise, especially strength training, which I only do occasionally

My pain
Pain in the neck that feels like a cord running into my left shoulder blade
Strongest when moving my head forward or backward, but present even when sitting or lying
Pain varies in intensity but has never completely gone away since May 2024
Pain radiates from the left shoulder blade into the left chest

Relevant medical history
At 18 in 2015: Daily left chest pain, referred to as heart pain. ECGs were normal and the doctor attributed it to muscles and recommended more movement
2018: Diagnosed with myocarditis after severe chest pain
Chest pain still occurs occasionally
2023: Heart MRI was normal

May 2024: Start of current symptoms
After two to three short episodes of what felt like a pinched nerve or a kind of lumbago between the left shoulder blade and neck after showering, the pain from the last episode stayed permanently
Went to the doctor and was referred to a radiologist

First cervical spine MRI result
Flat protrusion of discs C4/5 and C5/6
Slight right convex scoliosis of the cervical spine
Blockage of the thoracic spine
Otherwise normal

The orthopedic doctor said that mild scoliosis is common and probably not the cause, which already left me unsure.
What is very important to add here is that in hindsight it seems that the narrowing at C5/6 was already visible in this first MRI but was either overlooked or not mentioned. Later I was told that the radiologists did not include it in the report because they considered it not severe enough at that time.

June to October 2024: Physical therapy and heat therapy
10 sessions of manual therapy plus 10 sessions of heat therapy with no improvement
Additional 10 sessions, still no success
Neck and left shoulder blade continued to hurt constantly

November 2024 to April 2025: Tried everything, nothing helps
Physical therapy
Strength training, pain worsened, probably due to overtraining
Osteopathy
Yoga
Increased movement
Mobility exercises
Better sitting and working posture
Height adjustable desk
And more

Result: No improvement, only increasing frustration

April 2025: Thoracic spine MRI
Result: Upright positioning in the lower thoracic area, no degenerative changes, no protrusion, no narrowing of the spinal canal
In short, everything looked good

May 2025: Neurological examination
Pain began radiating into arms, hands and even feet, so I saw a neurologist
Result: Nerves seem fine

May to November 2025: More physical therapy, no improvement
Daily pain, daily despair
No progress despite continued efforts

November 2025: Another cervical spine MRI
Finally found something that at least sounds plausible
Slightly increasing right convex torsion scoliosis
Slight degeneration of discs C4/5 and C5/6
Unchanged flat protrusion at C5/6, left sided portion with slight narrowing of the neuroforamen, no visible nerve root compression

Orthopedic doctor said this is very likely the cause of my pain.
My immediate question was why this was not clearly detected or mentioned a year earlier.

Current situation and treatment
I was referred to a neurosurgeon and I am currently receiving PRT injections at C6 with anesthetics and cortisone to calm the nerve
Two out of five appointments are completed
Unfortunately there is no real improvement yet. The first injection gave brief hope, but the pain remains strong

What makes everything even harder for me mentally is that I no longer know which doctor to believe.
For example, the orthopedic doctor and the neurosurgeon say with high confidence that my pain is caused by the condition at C5/6.
At the same time, the radiologists say that this small narrowing is absolutely not enough to cause such symptoms and that the pain must come from something else.
This contradiction leaves me completely lost and insecure.

I tried to describe everything as accurately as possible. I may have forgotten some details, but I hope someone has advice or has experienced something similar.
Please feel free to ask questions. Every tip or experience could be the missing puzzle piece.

1pqn9ih,My new friend has chronic pain,"Hi all,

I apologize in advance if this post may be slightly triggering. I only want to understand how to best set boundaries so I don't burn out.

For clarity: my best friend back home has EDs and a number of other things that has caused her chronic pain for the past 5 years. I myself had a taste of chronic pain was like with a trapped nerve in both of my shoulders over the course of 2 years (pain level was a solid 3-4 most days that ramped up to a 7 every so often).

What the title says: I made a new friend back in August. She has chronic pain that has ramped up recently. Some kind of degenerative disease in her joints (not EDs or MS). Recently has had several seizures. Does not have a car, lost her job recently, and lives alone. She told me she'll probably end up losing her ability to walk due to the disease. She told me she's been feeling isolated because of this.

I'm starting to feel like I'm getting punished for not driving her places. When I can't do something because I'm tired or busy I feel like I spend the whole day talking her off the ledge. She hasn't used abusive language to me yet. It's more of a pattern I'm noticing where I say no and then she texts me about how much pain she is in, how isolated she feels and how depressed she is. I hit absolute rock bottom a few years ago due to abusive friends and had to claw my way back up to stable mental health. So I do understand the hopelessness and isolation she is feeling. I also latched onto people and burnt them out.

But I'm starting to burn out. I don't want to abandon her but I can't help her all of the time. The people that know her are telling me to not burn myself out helping. I like her as a friend. She's really cool and nerdy like me. She's Audhd and I'm ADHD. Sometimes we text about nerdy things but lately it's only been to ask me for a ride. I do not mind giving her rides because I often have errands to do in the area.

I have been getting muscle pain for... a while during 2025. From March to August, I had an intense muscle pain in my hip. I went to several doctors, did a big numbers of scan, got med but nothing helped. I went to see a chiropractor which helped in a way, it made my pain disappear for a few weeks before it began manageable in terms of pain. 

  
This week I woke up every morning with intense pain in my lower back, right side. To the point I had to go to the ER. Everyone looked at me like I was crazy, like I was lying? They found nothing in bloodwork and pee work (don't know what you call them in English). I saw my doctor and she cheerily announced I just had muscle pain. But having muscle pain so intense that it send you to the ER? I don't know, I find it very dubious. Call me crazy lol. She gave me the same medications that I had before in March. She also told me to go to a chiropractor. I feel like I just needed to rant and complain ahah. 

  
But I find that having muscle pain so intense without doing anything particular, like I play badminton but I didn't hurt myself nor did I do something wrong. I do warms up and all. I find it strange, maybe it's strange, maybe I am crazy but I do not find normal to have muscle pain all the time.

1pqicqa,Wrist Injury,"M (22) I almost died about 5 months ago in a crazy fall. Without going into detail, some combination of luck and some skill allowed me to walk away from it with pretty minor injuries all things considered. 

I broke a bone in my right wrist and dislocated my left elbow. I got surgery on my wrist and both injuries are getting better now but still have a ways to go. However about three months after the accident I realized my left wrist wasn’t healing well and was still quite weak. I it would get better as my elbow got better but that was not the case. Got it an MRI and find out the there are some partially torn ligaments and the bones are sitting all wrong. It isn’t super painful at rest but manipulation object over like 5 pounds is extremely painful. I have basically two options: live with my wrist how it is, or get a fusion surgery that will give me stability but result I’m permanent range of motion loss. 

I am very active. I work as a server and also a parkour coach. I’m an avid weight lifter, I train gymnastics, hand balancing, rock climbing, and many other things that require strong wrists. Many of these activities are so dear to me they are who I am. Despite doing lots of PT the last couple months it hasn’t felt much better. 

So I guess what I am struggling with and the reason I’m venting on Reddit is the thought that I may never be able to do many of the things that I love again, and if I do, likely not to the same level. It has really taken a toll on my mental health. I am trying to do other hobbies and things and I am okay most of the time with accepting how it is now, but every time I see something or think about what I can’t do anymore it is extremely depressing. I just miss all these things so damn much and the fact that they will never be the same hurts my soul. I am grateful to be alive and the rest of my body works pretty well but it still just blows. If anyone has experienced something similar with a life-changing injury I would love to hear about your experience.

1pqhw2t,Have you had surgeons who try to get you off pain management?,"Sorry if the title is bad, I wasn’t really sure what to word it.

So I’ve posted lots (and I had surgery yesterday so lots of couch time coming up) but I have a cluster of injuries from a bad car accident.  I posted yesterday about really struggling with my neck even though I’ve had ESI’s, an ablation and a disc replacement.  I’m very luck I get 20 mg a day of Percocet from my pain management Dr.  I love my job, just bought a house with my husband and really want to write her a nice letter just thanking her for taking care of me and helping me keep working over the past two years (outside of just meds, many procedures we have done have worked and she’s recommended good ortho/neuro drs to me).

Ok so yesterday I had the labral repair in my left hip repaired.  I’ve had the same ortho surgeon for both hip labral repairs and my right knee.  Right hip came out awesome, right knee is not great, he said I have a ton of arthritis so may try the gel, and too soon to tell about the left hip.  As much as I like my ortho surgeon his practice is VERY pushy about procedures.  He’s the only surgeon on my team who gives me a bit of a vibe of “ok what’s next?”.  

They are good and caring drs so I kinda ignore that part and my husband just had surgery with one of their back drs and that also went very well (an MD).  The opened  vein center and they are sending anyone with good insurance to have their veins checked and I asked my PT and she said that’s one of the new money makers because vein work used to be considered only cosmetic and is now being covered by insurance so everyone gets sent there.  My husband went (he’s 46) and has had 5 injections on different veins and feels no different.  And he said the whole process is just hella sketchy but that’s another post.

Alright so yesterday in preop - my surgeon comes out to mark my leg, I was really happy to see him because I had a rare cyst in my elbow that was messing with the nerves to my hand and it wasn’t really in his wheel house so he referred me out to a colleague and 2 drs later I got it removed and function of my hand back.  So I was excited to see him and say thank you.  So he looks at my meds list and asks why I’m still on percocet/in pain management.  He asked me this at my last surgery too and the best answer I could give was “it’s for all the other broken shit” which is true.  But yesterday since the issue with my neck is at the front of my mind, I word vommited  about  the hard time I’m having with my neck.  I have a disc replacement but not a fusion which I don’t want, if my dr will keep rx-ing for me, then I want to just chill for a bit.  So my ortho asked a few questions, who did my surgery (I always wonder why drs ask this because they can’t possibly all know each other but he did say we all generally know each other since it’s  medically sense area….which makes me wonder about the logistics side and if they have trouble getting patients because there are so many options).  Long story short he said it wouldn’t be a bad idea to get a second opinion with their spine surgeon who has two artificial discs in his own neck.  I may be wrong but I have generally wanted to stick with a neurosurgeon for spine stuff.  And even if I go see him what’s he going to say…..do a replacement of the disk or a fusion right?  So I go back to it feels like “what else can we cut on you” sorta vibe.  They have also made a comment or two that I have really good insurance that pays well (my husband is a state employee) which is another reason why I think they treat me a very good as a patient, along with the fact I’m generally really chill and I’m very healthy outside of my orthopedic issues so I’m an easy case.

Yesterday was surgery 7/8 (I had two surgeries in on session so I’m not sure if they count as one or two) in 16 months.  I kinda want to give me body a break if you know what I mean to just rest and see if some injuries just settle. Has anyone else had this experience? It feels….not right.

1pqf5jy,Free symptom tracking app,"Hi guys, I collaborated with a leading dietitian and designed an app to make health tracking easier. You can track symptoms, triggers (stress, sleep), treatments (medications, meditation), bowel movements, and literally anything else you want to track cause it’s fully customisable. You can view correlations on an insight graph to look for symptom trends, and export a PDF to share with your clinician. I literally obsessed over if for some years and it’s finally live on Google and Apple. I’m really proud of it and I hope it helps this community. If you want to try it search for Tummily on the app stores. The Apple App Store annoyingly thinks you’re misspelling “Yummily” so you have to tap that yes, you did mean to type “Tummily” 🙈. I’ll be making some improvements to it next year so anyone has any feature requests I’m all ears, you can request here 👇. Peace!",1766129574.0,1,13,ChronicPain,mental_physical

1pqbsd5,Parent of teen with chronic pain,"Hello, community. My son (13) has been experiencing what he describes as 9/10 pain (side note, thank you to some previous posters who gave other ways to use/add to the pain scale).

His pain started around six months ago when he started growing, and he has grown 6 inches in about 8 months. Before the pain was bad, but he could manage. Now it has begun to actually affect his daily life now. He skipped a shower (usually fastidious about them) because standing hurt to much. He asked to lie down during dinner, and most alarming he asked me to talk to his PE teacher to see if he could be excused from activities.

He has had a run of illness and pain starting 2022 when he got mono. Since then, it was bouts of covid, a torsion and preventative surgery against that, very often hit with bouts of nausea for seemingly no reason, his doctor tried treating for gastritis, and within six months he was doing better and now his nausea/stomach pain only seems to be when he gets a virus.

In August, he started experiencing a whole slew of new symptoms that lead to eventually finding SVT, and he will get ablation for that.

We thought, before, that the POTS symptoms and the pain was from growing so fast. But I’ve never heard of such bad growing pain that people cannot sit comfortably or shower.

With that background said, I have two pressing requests for advice and anecdotal discussion.

Does anyone have experience with these things? I’ve thought about EDS, but does it have to coincide with hyper flexibility? He has practically the opposite. 

He has another appointment in a couple weeks, and I’m going to start asking his doctor about starting a 504, with the hope that we can reduce penalties for participation on high pain days(currently he white-knuckles to avoid losing points at school, but it sounds like this might be escalating), and maybe even get something to help loosen attendance requirements so he can actually take care of himself when he needs to without worrying too much about needing to attend intersession or Saturday schools. I doubt that will get in there, because a 504 as far as I am familiar is only for classroom accommodations. What experience does anyone else have getting 504s for chronic pain?

AND does anyone have experience with anything my son is going through? Please please any advice is appreciated.",1766118084.0,17,29,ChronicPain,mental_physical

I wanted to share a very odd and uncomfortable experience I had in a chronic pain community on facebook and want to see if anyone has had a similar experience on social media. I made a post on here about my difficulties getting my prescription filled due to a pharmacist!s decision to just not fill it which I cross posted to a couple of subreddits and a facebook group I am active in. Well…this one woman sees my facebook post and TRIES TO SELL ME NARCOTICS PILLS. I was horrified!!! Not only is this ILLEGAL and would place both of us in major legal trouble it’s also extremely dangerous and flipping predatory and in extremely poor taste. This type of behavior is why situations like I experienced and so many pain patients experience happen over and over without any recourse or remittance. I frankly was horrified at the complete disregard and understanding of how this behavior harms those who take their meds as described, don’t sell their pills, and force themselves to go through all
the red tape just to get a med that just allows us to function. It just feels so scummy and disgusting and even though I like to think this was pure intentions I don’t know this person and her true reasons for reaching out. I ended up blocking her and reporting her to both facebook and the group who both took action. 

Has anyone had this happen to them? I’ve been on social
media for nearly 20 years and this is the first time someone has ever tried to sell me drugs, especially opioids. I’m still shook by this experience and the brazen stupidity of the person who sent me this message.

1pq5yub,Anyone gone the integrative/ functional medicine route?,"I'm starting to understand that normal doctors are not able to help me. I have chronic inflammation, pain and fatigue. I am at the end of my rope. The only diagnoses I have related to it are fibromyalgia and hypermobility (unsure if eds). My rheumatologist is out of answers, along with my pain medicine doctor, primary care, spine doc, neurologist (migraines). They won't give me pain medication and I can no longer take nsaids due to my stomach. I really feel its important for me to know the cause of my chronic inflammation because it is making me so sick. 

Has anyone had luck with functional medicine or should I just stop pushing for answers? I'm just so beyond frustrated because it feels like I've hit a dead end with all my doctors. I just got to the end of a pt round of 8 weeks and I basically failed out because my pain is worse. I wanted to follow up with my spine doctor and they basically told me theres nothing more to do if the injections and pt didn't work.

Eating always causes me issues. Whether it's stomach pain (I'm diagnosed with gastritis and bile reflux), acid reflux (currently 1 month post-TIF to cure this issue), a migraine, neckache, sinus pain, or whole body aches - I always end up with some sort of discomfort after eating and it's driving me up the wall.

No one else I have ever known in my life has this issue, and I feel utterly alone.

PPI's don't help, H2 Blockers don't help, and Tylenol doesn't help the pain. Interestingly, Codeine does help. It was what helped me through my teenage years (while also possibly adding to the pain as well). I'm no longer taking Codeine though. 

Gastro doctors are generally useless. It's not totally their fault, I suppose. GI research isn't as researched as it should be. 

And I feel so... old because of this, lmao. I'm 23 and the thought of having to live another 60 or so years like this makes me feel depressed. I have a lot of goals I want to achieve in life, because, well, I love life. I really do. I like being alive. I just hate being in pain. 

 I absolutely love food, too, and my relationship with it is not healthy. I'm scared of it, I crave it, I don't want it, I desire it, I feel repulsed by it, yet the second it touches my lips... all the pain goes away for a little while. And the cycle repeats. It's maddening.

1pptgf2,My Story,"My story with mold starts in 2017. I got married and moved into an older home with a musty cellar. I contributed this smell to just an “older house” smell. I didn’t think about the health complications mold could cause. I didn’t connect any dots when I started having tingling in my hands and legs and muscle weakness in my hands. My dog also got sick at the same time. He had loss of use in back legs, bloody stool, and ulcers. He got diagnosed with lupus. I went to the doctors for bloodwork and just dealt with the random symptoms that came and went for years. We moved around a lot being in the military and I only stayed at that home for one year. 

In January 2025, I got hit by a nerf dart in the temple. Within a week I developed severe light sensitivity, sound sensitivity, migraines, vertigo, neuropathy, neck stiffness and pain/burning, ear ringing & whooshing heartbeat sounds, head pressure, weakness in my legs, joint pain, muscular pain, and so many more symptoms. I couldn’t drive, and at times I couldn’t even fold laundry or do dishes without triggering burning in my neck and a migraine. I saw many doctors and all of them wanted to give me migraine meds. I had a lot of testing done including an MRI of my head and neck, and a cat scan of my head. Everything came back normal and the only finding was low iron. I did physical therapy 2x a week for the dizziness and migraines, and Craniosacral therapy for ten months. I cut all sugar, cut down coffee, ate as clean as possible. Spent so much money at the ER, random specialists, and doing PT. Every dr told me I couldn’t possibly have a concussion and some people just are susceptible to migraines. The neurologist wouldn’t even do nerve testing. 

Left frustrated, I decided to reach out to a functional Dr and have myself tested for mold and Lyme disease. I remembered my mold exposure from years ago and had seen online that mold can cause similar symptoms. My mold tests came back overwhelmingly positive, and included mycotoxins that can be produced by black mold. My Lyme test came back positive, along with bartonella and HGA. My next step was to test my home. I didn’t know if my mycotoxins test was from current or past exposure. I ordered an ERMI test to test my house. The results were incredibly bad. Results from two completely  companies matched up perfectly. I looked up the symptoms of the molds/mycotoxins I tested positive for and it could explain each and every one of my symptoms. I left my house within a week with nothing but the clothes on my back and stayed with my mom. Within a week of being out of my home, nearly every single symptom was gone or significantly better. I’ve done things I never thought I’d be able to do again. 

Right before I suspected mold and ordered those tests, I got a positive specked ANA result. I was supposed to make an appointment with rheumatology. I guarantee I would have been diagnosed with multiple autoimmune conditions at that appointment with the symptoms I was having and the fact that it had been ten months. I just want everyone to know the effects of mold and untreated Lyme. I never had any visible mold on my walls or any belongings. I had only been bit by a tick once in my life. Please if you have a mystery illness or even a diagnosed illness, dig deeper and try to find a root cause. I’ve seen on mold groups that people have been wrongly diagnosed with fibromyalgia, MS, Parkinson’s, and more.

1ppowce,What Medication and/or life change worked for you.," I suffer with ostioarthritis in my spine so I am in constant chronic pain as my vertibrea wear away.
 I was on Amitryptyline for a while but that didnt do anything, this was changed to Nortrityline which actualy works. I am also on co-codomal but have managed to reduce the strength to be able to use over the counter ones.
 I attended a core strength course for 4 weeks and continue with as much of the excersise as i can.
 It looks like the meds and the exercise are paying dividends. I am not by any means 100% and never will be but feel I am getting better.

 What medication, excersises or life style changes worked or did not work for you?

1ppidb4,Pain management with complex spinal issues,"Hello guys,

I had a “ failed “ ACDF done back in 2023, the surgeon could not properly decompress my C3-C4 area as there was complications arising from scar tissue being adhered to the dura. 

Fast forward two years later and I am diagnosed with myelomalacia pre surgery ( C3-C4 ) and severe Neuro foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 with bi lateral pars defect and nerve compression ( grade 2 almost 3 slippage ) 

I finally found another Neuro surgeon willing to see me and “ own “ my case with potential fusion at L5-S1.  Pain management has been an absolute nightmare though.  I have had the past three doctors literally say there is nothing more they can do for me. I’m in PT, tried injections and will continue trying them, I see urology, a neurologist, I’m enrolled in ECM, and I’m in persistent 7-9 pain daily in my neck and lumbar spine.  Keep in mind I’m receiving care at one of the premier academic hospitals in the country and my insurance has approved me for a higher level of care ( UCI ) 

I am on lyrica and clonazepam ( 300 my daily, 1 mg daily ).  I guess my questions are: 
1) does PM just see me as to risky to prescribe ANYTHING, they do not want to be liable for throwing any other meds in the mix.  They do not want to be help accountable for “ masking “ symptoms with medication? 
A. When I go to the ER I always leave with a morphine script for at least a few days, actively validating my pain is REAL and debilitating and telling me to see PM asap. 
2) does PM even offer medication management or prescribe medications anymore or will I have more luck with my neurologist or PCP even? 

Has anyone else had to experience the merry go round of deferring care to other areas constantly.  Maybe I have too many doctors or just again look too risky to care with anything meaningful, I mean the PM doc said we could try a SCI before medication? I’m not so sure about that. 

Please let me know guys! ",1766034077.0,3,4,ChronicPain,mental_physical

1ppg7wu,Medication advice,"Little bit of backstory: I’ve had chronic pain most of my life. As a child/teen I had severe “growing pains” as well as back pain that my doctors and parents (who are in the medical field) often told me it was never that bad/I was exaggerating/completely normal for a growing child. (I stopped growing in the 7th grade and am only 4’11). Because of the amount of pain I was in I was always taking Tylenol and Motrin to the point that now at age 29 it will no longer work for any type/amount of pain. 

I will also note that from age 16- 27 I was on almost every antidepressant/antipsychotic/ssri/etc for depression and anxiety. Every 3 months with the psychiatrist was the same, up the dosages till I’m maxed out and then try a new combination. Rinse and repeat. Last year I finally said fuck it and started ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy) for treatment resistant depression/suicidal ideation. This has been the only thing to truly work for my mental health. 

In regards to my chronic pain I’m trying to find an OTC that could possibly work. The only medication I have found to slightly work with my pain is Aleve, however if I take it daily for more than a week it becomes ineffective and I have to “detox” for at least a week afterwards and deal with the pain. I have tried lidocaine patches and those have also done nothing. My main pain concern is a spot on my spine on my lower back. I believe it to be some form of sciatica. I have been experiencing this specific pain for about 8 years now and it has gotten only worse. 

I am currently trying to contact any neurologist in my area, however the only one who has gotten back to me said that that can see me in October of next year (2026). I set that appointment but hoping someone else will see me sooner. Any advice or tips for me to manage till then would be greatly appreciated. ",1766027258.0,2,1,ChronicPain,mental_physical

1ppf507,How do I argue that I'm under treated?,"I've been on buprenorphine for extended release and hydrocodone for instant release. My doctor recently took away my hydrocodone for break through pain and left me with buprenorphine alone for extended release. I'm still in incredible pain and now I'm super pissed. I wrote a letter to my DR which she refused to read during the appt. 

COULD YOU PLEASE REVIEW IT & PROVIDE FEEDBACK PLEASE!?!?! Be as critical as you need to be. 

""Dear Dr.,
I’ve been feeling incredibly anxious and abandoned after our last meeting and changing the plan to treat my pain, and I’m beginning to feel frustrated. I don’t want to feel this way because I know you are doing your best to help me. I think, perhaps, our last appointment didn’t go so well because of a few things I said combined with you having an inadequate client profile, so I wanted to help you get to know me better.

I would like to start out by saying that education has always been important to me, which is probably why I went to cosmetology school before getting my BA and eventually two MAs, including a Masters Degree in psychology. I’ve always been interested in psychology because I come from a traumatic background (I now have PTSD) and wanted to figure out not only why I do the things I do, but also why others do what they do. I also have a long history in the realm of medicine and have a fair knowledge of medicines, brain functions and anatomy.

I also want you to know that pain is something I’ve lived with for almost my whole life. I was 15 when I discovered I couldn’t sweep the floor without needing to take a break to sit down since my low back hurt so much. I was 17 when I had breast reduction surgery, but it didn’t do much to help with the low back pain. While preparing for that surgery, a 2004 x-ray showed lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LSTV). The findings showed “there is partial lumbarization of S1 with a false joint with some sclerosis noted between the transverse process of S1 and S2 on the right. Spina bifida occulta is noted at the S1 level” (Radiology Report). I’ve been told that my LSTV shouldn’t cause pain, but I’m pretty sure this is where my low back pain originates. “LSTV has been reported to alter the biomechanics of the lumbar spine and contribute to low back pain.” (3)

Now, I suffer from high impact chronic intractable pain, which generally presents as concurrent nociceptive, neuropathic and nociplastic pain, meaning my daily experience with pain is always unique (see Table 1). However, the chronic pain I feel always worsens as the day progresses, which I understand is typical of osteoarthritis. The weather changes my pain as well, increasing pain levels when it rains or snows, or when the temperature changes drastically. Being too warm or too cold will trigger a multiple sclerosis flare of past pain symptoms. Occasionally I even have days where my joints subluxate, usually my knees, hips or fingers—what triggers it is still a mystery to me (I’m thinking its spondyloarthritis). I have a variety of other pain symptoms that pop up as well, which makes having medication on hand a preference of mine. I usually only visit the ER if my pain is not able to be treated with the medication I have at home or if the symptoms last for a long period of time, especially because I am on multiple immune suppressants and get sick very easily.  

I understand the instinct to protect your position as a medical professional (as you should), as well as the way prescribing pain medication has changed since the opioid crisis, but chronic pain patients are at a very low risk for opioid addiction.

*“An estimated 3-12% of people treated with opioids for chronic pain will develop an addiction or abuse with negative consequences.” (1)

*“A systematic review reports…that only 8% to 12% [of chronic pain patients] develop an opioid use disorder.” (2)

I am often thankful that I don’t suffer from addictive behavior. Since being diagnosed with diabetes, I quit drinking soda and limit my coffee intake to one cup a day, essentially quitting caffeine. I have also quit drinking alcohol, which I used to use for pain relief, since pain medication is much preferred. At my neurologists suggestion, I take one day a week as a break from Adderall, and I think it would be easy to stop taking it all together, hut I would only he awake a few hours a day due to my narcolepsy and would never get anything done. The only vice I seem to have left is smoking cigarettes, which I truly believe is more of a behavioral addiction than a nicotine addiction. 

I am technically at higher risk of committing suicide than becoming addicted to pain medication. “8.8% of deaths by suicide can be attributed to chronic pain.” (5) “People with MS may be twice as likely to die by suicide as people in the larger population.” (6) ""Pain management programs may reduce suicide risk in patients with chronic pain.” (4) However, I am suicide resilient. I am a QPR trained Suicide Gatekeeper, which the Surgeon General’s National Strategy for Suicide Prevention (2001) defines as “someone in a position to recognize a crisis and the warning signs that someone may be contemplating suicide.” (8)

I believe my outlook for my future health is realistic. I have many activities that I regularly participate in to try to reduce my pain (see Table 2). I need to adhere to dosage limits for NSAIDs and Tylenol, as I will be using these medications daily for the rest of my life and don’t want to destroy my insides. The chronic health conditions I have are incurable, so I can only strive to effectively manage them. The many types of arthritis I’ve acquired are degenerative and will continue to get worse over time (I’d put money on rheumatoid arthritis in my future). Due to my diabetes, I will have to be cognizant of what I eat and make sure my blood sugars are in an appropriate range. I will never have a pain free day in my life again—but there are medications that were made specifically to reduce pain for chronic pain sufferers like me.

I am not opioid naive. I have been prescribed opioids by doctors and dentists sporadically as early as my teenage years. This is my third pain contract (technically 4th if you count Allina separately). Both times my previous pain contracts ended, I quit opioids without difficulty despite physical dependence. One of those contracts was with my current General Practitioner Allison McVay-Steer, who I encourage you to reach out to if you want more information.

All of the doctors before Allison were ageist, assuming I was too young to be in serious pain. Nobody thought I had an autoimmune disorder. Even after being diagnosed with MS, I continue to struggle to find appropriate treatment for more than one medical problem. I see dozens of doctors and a plethora of specialists, but all of them have left me undertreated. I don’t have big dreams anymore, but one dream I do have is to be able to go back to work part time. I have multiple degrees gathering dust on the walls and after 5 years of unemployment I’m bored and unfulfilled. Further, the amount of money I make on disability only increases if I increase my lifetime wage earnings and being poor really sucks.

I truly do believe that you are a good doctor with knowledgeable experience, which is why I have done everything that you have asked me to. I just finished swim therapy in October and I loved it. I was told I became stronger and more coordinated after our time. If there’s a way to get insurance to continue to cover this, I would definitely continue to go. I love swimming!

When you first suggested botox for my headaches, I was still in denial of my migraines but botox worked beautifully. I just had my consult with Fairview neurology last week, so hopefully I will be able to continue that treatment soon. My meralgia paresthetica was a numb, loss of feeling sensation for years until one day a burning pain started screaming through my skin, but you knew right away what kind of pain I was describing and prescribed gabapentin. The proof is in the pudding—you have definitely provided treatment options that have been successful in reducing my pain, but I am still in severe chronic pain.

I have pain everyday at varying pain levels and for numerous reasons, which is why I need both extended release pain coverage and instant release medication for breakthrough pain. The damage to my body, as evidenced by my MRIs, and the long list of diagnoses I have are proof that I should be prescribed a class of drugs made for chronic and severe pain, not a class of drugs that is made for those with opioid use disorder, because I am in chronic severe pain and I do not and have not ever suffered from opioid use disorder or any other substance abuse disorder.

My last two pain contracts were for oxycontin and oxycodone. Both of those medications worked well for me, as they provided appropriate coverage of my pain and don’t seem to cause any side effects. ”OXYCONTIN is…indicated for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period with a daily opioid analgesic” (7)

I would like to switch from Gabapentin to Lyrica, because lyrica is FDA approved to treat fibromyalgia. However, I would not like to take large doses of either lyrica or gabapentin, since both drugs show evidence that they halt the formation of new brain synapses and increase the risk of dementia. I would also like to try Tonmya for fibromyalgia pain, as this drug was also recently FDA approved for that.

Spinal decompression therapy and swim therapy are incredibly helpful treatments as well, but I don’t have the money to pay for them out of pocket. I’m also willing to discuss other alternative therapies or surgical procedure that might be helpful. I’ve recently been looking into cervical facet radiofrequency, percutaneous disc nucleoplasty, intradiscal electrothermal therapy, and racz caudal neurolysis.

I believe additional medical testing would be helpful. Imaging of spinal damage, including specifically my LSTV, L5 to S2, should be done using a SPECT/CT scans or a Ferguson radiograph x-ray. Perhaps blood tests would provide useful information as well if we look at cytokines, ferritin, HSCRP, and homocysteine.

Lastly, I think I’m overdue for someone to poke my head with needles. Am I going to continue getting injections (such as trigger points) with you, or is that something that should be done at Fairview alongside my botox injections? I am willing to sign any forms you would like for a release of information from Fairview. I have also consulted with a member of the National Pain Council, and have a couple materials from this organization that I would like for you to read.

I want to thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I hope my blunt and transparent tone wasn’t too off-putting  I truly do believe that you are a great doctor and hope we can continue working together to alleviate my pain.

Sincerely,
Liz

1ppdzhi,"Move over My Super Sweet 16, welcome to my over-the-top pity party","I’ve been dealing with neck pain and headaches for about two decades with a diagnosis of migraine. My family physician has tried me on various preventatives, pain relievers and muscle relaxers and in between I’ve consulted with three neurologists, who counseled me about diet and triggers and done imaging. I even tried PT. I thought maybe the hydromyelia found in one image could be the real issue, but the neurologist said it was too small. At that point, I just stopped and tried to manage. 

Five or so years later, my pain had become increasingly worse and more frequent, I was experiencing constant tingling in my hands and feet (family history of Parkinson’s) and shoulder/upper arm pain, so I started looking for answers again. Lots of new imaging, new specialists and new or new-again findings (iron low again, Vitamin D low again, low B-12, abnormal EMG, borderline positive ANA, mild TMJ, dysphagia, tinnitus, congenital malformation of the posterior arch of C1) but no new answers. Tried PT again and also tried dry needling, trigger point injections and ESI. Nothing worked.

During all of this, I experienced indifference, lack of communication/follow up and was made to feel like I was just whiny or drug-seeking. My last hope was the rheumatologist I’d been waiting to see for months. First off, he thought I’d been referred due to arthritis found in my hand during imaging of my shoulder, which was not even mentioned to me by the Orthopedic Surgeon. At the end of a very brief physical exam consisting of a couple of squeezes to my legs, him watching me raise my arms and then having me bend my neck forward and back, he told me he saw nothing rheumatologic but to follow up as needed. Oh, and he asked me to stop by the front desk on my way out to sign a release for them to obtain medical records from the Ortho office that had referred me.

The way I’m feeling right now, I won’t ever seek help from another doctor again- even if I’m literally on fire.",1766020680.0,2,4,ChronicPain,mental_physical

Which their web site takes me to the Florida Board of Health. So I guess I’m sending it to all 3. Please take the time to read it ok guys. Thanks. 

Reason for ADA Complaint – Pharmacy Refusal to Fill Prescription

I am filing this complaint because multiple pharmacies have refused to fill a legally valid Schedule II prescription for my brother, who is a person with significant disabilities. Denying him access to prescribed medication creates a barrier to necessary medical treatment and may constitute discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

My brother is mentally disabled, is in stage 4 kidney failure, has only 25% pancreatic function remaining, and his bladder no longer works. He requires a suprapubic catheter. His medical conditions cause severe pain and require consistent treatment through medication prescribed by his physician. When pharmacies refuse to fill his Schedule II prescription solely because it is a controlled substance, despite proper documentation, they are preventing equal access to healthcare services.

This refusal has caused physical suffering, emotional distress, and unnecessary delays in care. I am requesting investigation into these pharmacy practices and assistance in ensuring that individuals with disabilities receive equal access to necessary medication without discrimination or unjust denial of service.",1766016585.0,62,78,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1ppcehw,"I’m 1 year post op from a cervical ADR and still in pain, I don’t want to fuse.","Hi friends - the majority of my injuries come from a bad rear ender car accident at the end of 2023.  I had 4 herniated discs in my neck, with neck pain, and radiating arm pain down the right arm.  When tested by the surgeon I had weakness in the c5 area and weakness in my right hand.  He recommended a c5/c6 disc replacement and fusion.  I was 39 and scared of getting a fusion so young so I opted for just the disc replacement.  He told me it would help with the arm symptoms but wouldn’t help the neck pain.  At the time the neck pain wasn’t the biggest of my issues so I figured it would be ok.  Today I am 1 year post op from the disc replacement (I am having my 8th surgery from the accident tomorrow).

As I fixed other issues my neck pain got worse.  By June of last year I needed a whole routine for my neck from meds in the am, to a hot pack, to thc/cbd rub, to a tens unit, to ac in the afternoon with more meds.  Now I’m a hs teacher.  I talk A LOT.  Like not only am I a teacher I’m a gabby teacher and honestly it’s one of the things that makes me good at my job.  But I found talking is what really makes my neck hurt.  In the summer when I was off my neck was way better.  So I saw my surgeon in July to review a new cervical MRI that looked great.  I had a bulge left at c4/c4, the disc was in place, and the other two herniations replaced.  The only thing they saw was on the xray my c5 was tipping forward over my c6 vertebrae.  They said it could be causing the pain (and at the time I had extreme hand shaking on the right which turned out to be caused by an elbow ganglion cyst) and a fusion would be the route to solve it but since in that moment I was feeling a bit better my surgeon said to wait on it and see how I felt after a bit.  I started the process for a cervical ablation in August.

I had told myself give the disc a year.  Today is a year.  And even after one side of the cervical ablation, my neck feels terrible.  I’m having hip surgery tomorrow and I try to drop my meds down before surgery to drop my tolerance a bit and my neck is just so stiff, crackling and nay movement hurts.  I sometimes get some stabbing in my traps or a bit of pain down over my shoulders.  Sometimes stabbing in my lower neck/upper back. 

So….what do I do?  Just try to ride it out on pain meds until they won’t rx me any more? Just take the jump into the fusion since it’s only one level? My biggest fear is it isn’t only one level for long…is it 10 years before c6/c7 goes….or 3?  I’m scared I’ll get it and it will do nothing and now I’ve put something permanent in my neck.  Do I keep searching other answers? I’ve considered seeking out ketamine infusions since I still have other pain issues.  I’ve thankfully got a colleague who had two cervical fusions from a supermarket slip and fall and shes gonna come over and chat with me about it over our spring break - she gave me a big hug and said “I know exactly where you are because I was there too”.

Are there positive fusion stories? I know this isn’t the place to look for them but I’d be curious even if someone had success for a certain amount of time.  I feel like I should keep trying to treat with pain meds until I see neurological issues.  But maybe that’s not the way to go about it.

1ppc2i9,Why don't doctors have some kind of checklist or for diagnosing pain?,"I've been experiencing a lot of chronic pain for the past two to three years without showing any positive blood tests. Doctors have generally shrugged or suggested I might have fibromyalgia, even though I don't have any of the fatigue or brain fog, it's all arthritic pain and haven't responded to meds prescribed for fibro. 

So I started researching arthritic conditions that don't show up on blood tests and of course there are a TON. Since then I have been tested more specifically for Lyme's disease, crohn's, celiac, psoriatic arthritis, gout, and more. 

But it got me thinking, why did I specifically have to ask for these? I have made clear to my doctors that the pain is on the verge of forcing me to quit my job, it's not an ""emergency room"" emergency but it is a general life emergency for me. I want to get tested for everything under the sun but I generally just get tested for specific things I request or an idea that the doctor has. Every time I learn about a new condition that nobody brought up while my life is in flames it makes me furious. Can't we come up with some kind of checklist so we can just cover all our bases and get it done quickly?  If rheumatologists are connective tissue doctors and there are tons of connective tissue conditions that don't show up on blood tests, why do they require a positive ANA to do anything at all, forcing me to work with my PCP who doesn't have the expertise I need?",1766015413.0,11,8,ChronicPain,mental_physical

1pp9ihe,Belcuca is an incredibly expensive piece of shit.,"OK, so I used to be a cyclist who trained 7-8 thousand miles per year.  Chronic pain after a botched surgery in Omaha/NE (Total Pain Solutions - in June of 2023) took it all away from me.

Now my primary doctor has me on 600 mcg of Belbuca film twice per days.  It's $400 per month and does absolutely nothing for my chronic pain.  I see other cyclists, guys I rode with, who smashed themselves to pieces and three months later they're back on the bike, since they don't have any nerve damage.  There is a guy in my former cycling group who smashed his hip and four months later he's riding - didn't even need hip replacement and was in no pain a week after his surgery as they reconstructed his hip.

Does anyone else have any experience (good or bad) with Belbuca?  I think my only solution to my chronic pain caused by my botched surgery will be Magnum .44 since nothing works and my present life is not worth living.",1766008954.0,23,77,ChronicPain,mental_physical

1pp8u77,Do you tell people when you’re in pain?,"I don’t mean just like all the time whenever you’re in pain because… well that would be near constant. I mean if you were at work for example and someone asked you to do something that could wait and is not at all imperative would you say agree to do said task but in a minute, say no or give them an actual reason for your choice ie telling them you’re in pain. I always feel weird about it and I receive a variety of responses from people just being concerned and doing the task for me or with me all the way to people questioning my ability to tolerate “mild” pain, ability to work and just straight up mocking me “wait till your my age…”. 

I will literally grit my teeth and clench my jaw to push through a task if I can. I can feel myself limping as I walk and breathing heavily with pain. There’s 2 people at work I see a lot and I’ve not even worked at this place for a year and though they never push or say much I know they know I’m in pain and they just seem concerned. Nobody else seems to have noticed. I don’t want anyone to see me in pain because it makes me feel vulnerable but I also feel like people need to see that I’m in pain but I’m trying to cover it so that when i have to avoid tasks or need help I don’t feel judged.

Every time I see these 2 people (who I’d like to note are older than me, one about 10-15 years older and the other is a few years older than my dad for reference) they always ask me if I’m okay because “you look really tired”, they always check in on me and I really appreciate them. Other people however I just have no idea what they think.

I work a very physically demanding job so usually my 2 days at work honestly make me feel suicidal by the time I get home. The pain is so intense and scary. I hate knowing that I’m doing things that I shouldn’t or don’t need to for the sake of not feeling judged or perceived as lazy (especially because I’m a bigger girl than average). 

Especially after I shift when I finally stop I become very overwhelmed with my pain. It stresses me out because I know that I’ve just ran around for over 12 hours taking care of very sick children breaking my back literally to prioritise patient care and yet now my shift is over I’m physically incapable of taking care of myself. I physically can’t move once I stop- literally. Can’t make dinner, can’t do anything for me just nothing. I would honestly do anything for the kids I work with, I’m very proud of my job, I love my job but I also want to make my job easier.

1pp78le,Coping tools? Distractions? Any and all ideas.,"Hi friends, 

I’m sorry that we’re all here on this subreddit. I’m seeking advice. 

I have binge-eating disorder because I use food as a coping tool for my pain. It distracts me, makes me feel really good, and, if I really stuff myself, the nausea I feel is MUCH more preferable than the pain. It’s basically a form of self-harm. I’m in psychotherapy for this, but my therapist and I are really struggling to think of ways to replace this behavior. So far, the biggest progress we’ve made is that if I feel like binge-eating, first I must take a painkiller and wait for it to kick in (or do something else similarly pain-relieving). 

  
What tools do you guys use to distract from the physical pain? I’m interested in hearing EVERYTHING, even the unhealthy coping tools. I know all our pain is different, so I’m only talking about distractions, not pain relief tools which are specific to each person. ",1766003489.0,1,7,ChronicPain,mental_physical

1pp72kk,Pharmacist refused to refill the remainder of my monthly prescription despite it being a 30 day supply and being out of state when the current supply runs out,"Discrimination at Walgreens on Hamilton and Galbraith

TLDR: Pharmacist refused to  fill the remainder of a monthly prescription of a schedule IV controlled substance due to “personal preferences” with no obvious safety/addiction safety concerns noted and chronic pain patient being out of state and willing to present plane tickets to indicate that she would be unable to pick up and be out of meds after current 10 day supply runs out

Hi all. I wanted to share about an extremely negative experience I had at the walgreens on Hamilton and Galbraith regarding a pharmacist refusing to fill my prescription due to “personal preference” and miscommunication between this “personal preference” and pharmacy technician. I am prescribed a schedule IV controlled substance for chronic pain as well as other higher scheduled drugs for other conditions. On Monday night I go to fill a 30 day supply of my med that walgreens had not filled on
time due to “insurance issues” so I was already out of medication due to their negligence. At this time I was given the option to pick up a partial fill of 10 of the 30 pills due to the pharmacy being out and was told by the tech that I could come by on Tuesday to have the rest of the prescription filled once the rest of the medication came in. Thinking nothing of this and because I was out of the med and in pain I picked up 10 of the 30 pills and went on my way fully expecting the rest of the 30 day prescription to be filled on Tuesday as promised with plans to pick it up then or later in the week so I would have the rest of the month available to cover me while I was out of state. 

Well…Tuesday rolls around and the prescription is not filled. I call
and speak to the pharmacist who tells me that he will not fill the remainder of the 30 day prescription until all of the 10 days of pills were used. When I explain that I would be out of state and without pills for 6 days due to this requirement and that the partial fill was made due a PHARMACY issue he refused to budge. 

After messaging my doctor who prescribed this I reach back out to walgreens to try to figure this out myself and get the same pharmacist who tells me the same thing. When I tell him that I am flying out on Saturday morning and will present plane tickets to prove this if necessary he reluctantly agreed to fill the prescription “for Friday” which I agreed to. Well I go into the walgreens app to check if this had been completed and lo and behold there is no records that the prescription is in the process of being filled. 

I want to make it clear that there is NO record of any abuse (attempts at early fills, abhorrent behavior etc) that would warrant concern that I was misusing this drug and I did not even fill the bridge prescription my doctor prescribed because it took walgreens so long to fill this prescription the month prior. I also have to pay for this prescription in cash due to
my insurance not covering it because they want to cover (long acting high dose opioids) not some mild scheduled IV ER version of a drug. I can also present a drug test that shows the presence of this med in my system at doses consistent with prescribed usage 

This is absolutely nothing more than a pharmacist exploiting his professional right to refuse to fill and walgreens policy to override a doctors order and discriminate against a chronic pain patient without any valid reason to deny meds.Its disgusting, it’s deplorable, and due to this being a walgreens policy there is absolutely no recourse that can be taken with walgreens corporate, the pharmacy board, federal agencies to protect against discrimination, and other institutions so those of us with chronic illness are just left to suffer because of a pharmacists “personal preference” that overrides that of a doctor’s care. 

I apologize for this being so long, but those who take controlled meds AS PRESCRIBED deserve to know that a single person has the power to withhold care and there is absolutely nothing we can do about it even if this error is on the pharmacy. ",1766003098.0,82,123,ChronicPain,mental_physical

1pp2cve,I feel like a fraud.,"10 days ago I did something to my shoulder/collarbone. My doctor thinks it's a significant AC joint injury. It's been a painful 10 days, and frustrating due to limited activity. I had my x rays yesterday and my MRI is on the 23rd. I have experienced joint instability for a long time (I was 7 when I experienced my first joint subluxation) there is family history of joint instability (my sister especially).

TL;DR: I feel like an absolute fraud during this whole ordeal especially after the x rays and now waiting for my MRI appointment.

Backstory:
I have experienced a lot of medical gaslighting in my life, especially over this, because my sister was so bad needing 10 surgeries on her hips by the time she was 6. So in my *entire* family's eyes, i couldn't be experiencing anything remotely like what she was. I got laughed at when I was 14 and my sternum popped for the first time and I said ""why is my boob popping?"" I got laughed at again a few months later when I felt a rib that had gone out of place and it felt broken. I've been medically gaslit by my parents, aunts and uncles and grandma, and the PCP I had until 2021. It has done so much damage physically and mentally, especially when my doctor didn't take my pain seriously. When I got diagnosed with fibromyalgia when I was 19, my family said ""well, your grandma has that, what about her pain, you're only 19, suck it up."" I got called a hypochondriac for a LONG, long time.

Fast forward to now, years of pushing through pain from ""muscle knots"" in my shoulder was taking it's toll. In August I asked for a Beighton score assessment, it was 7. I was referred and currently waiting to be denied for genetic testing by the last provider in my state so Medicaid will approve and pay for out of state providers. 

My sternum began popping more and more. I pushed through it. The frequency started to go down but I felt a weird sensation in my collarbone, like bones were getting stuck on each other, until a pop and the sensation went away and after a few minutes it stopped hurting. Didn't think much of it because my shoulder hurt so bad and for the last 8 years it's been subluxating, but that was just a muscle knot and never concerning to anyone so why would it concern me?

Pulling my blankets over me 10 days ago, the AC joint crunched/snapped so loud it woke my boyfriend up. Never experienced anything like it. I went to my amazing PCP 4 days later and she ordered x rays and MRIs. My pain is always bad, but some days are better than others. Over the last 10 days i have felt my AC, i learned that the sternum popping was an SC joint issue, and I learned that the first sign of shoulder trouble was when I was 14 with the sternum popping. Day 5 post injury I felt my humerus subluxate in/from the socket. By my x rays yesterday I could feel my scapula being pulled away from my spine- I think this is a scapula subluxation?

I had the x rays done yesterday and I don't know why but I feel like such a fraud. I feel like I've deceived everyone. I could be in the worst pain and still feel as though none of this is a big deal that I'm not strong, it hurts so much because I don't handle pain very well (I don't even know if that's true or not). I feel like I'm over reacting. This makes it hard to use a sling, and makes it hard to limit my activity. I'm having the worst anxiety attacks, because 90% of my testing and images come back with normal margins, no comments, nothing major found.

For what it's worth though, 2 years ago my spine MRIs showed C5-C6 disc protrusion and mild canal narrowing; my thoracic spine showed mild kyphosis; this year a chest x ray showed degenerative changes in my thoracic spine. But no one really said or did anything about it. That definitely didn't help with this imposter syndrome I am experiencing.

I don't know how to wrap this up, but i'll answer any questions. Just please don't ask or tell me about physical therapy. Due to so many issues with transportation I have to do it by myself at home and I believe this is also what contributed to this mess because I didn't know that I *actually* had joint hyper mobility and needed very specific physical therapy. I'm working on it.  

Edit: I put the wrong Beighton score, got it mixed up with my fibromyalgia score lol.",1765992182.0,3,2,ChronicPain,mental_physical
1poyclu,I’m so tired of being in pain and having no doctor knowing why.,"Be warned this is long and very rant centered:

For the past 8 years I’ve been in pain, and no doctor can figure out why. And it’s frustrating cause it’s not just one thing, my entire body hurts, all the damn time.

It’d be easier to make a list of symptoms I don’t have ffs.

I’ve been tested for and came up negative with the following: 

- three kinds of arthritis (Rheumatoid, Osteo and late stage juvenile ((I’m 25 the last one made no sense imo)))
- MS (I have every single symptom except for lesions, and when I mean every symptom I mean even the uncommon ones of MS like bowel issues) 
- Chrons disease
- Lyme (never been bit by a tick but it was tested)
- hypo-hyperthyroidism (I’ve been tested for both of these every single time I’ve had bloodwork so upwards of 20+ times in the last 8 years)
- diabetes 
- Ehlers Danlos syndrome (I’m hypermobile in all my joints) 

I’m constantly exhausted no matter how much sleep I get, I’m in physical pain every single day and there’s no fucking reason for it, I’ve had no accidents, I’ve had the joint pain since I was a child (I don’t even know how to describe it but if I’m walking for more than an hour my shins hurt in a way that I’m convinced being hit by a car would be less painful) 

No history of physical trauma indicates it’s either autoimmune or neurological, given the fact I had no lesions show on my MRI rules out MS despite meeting every other diagnostic criteria.

Oh and the allodynia is spreading, first it was just on my back now it’s extending into the backs of my thighs and tops of my shoulders, I love how even wearing a shirt feels like 1000 hot knives are being dragged across my skin, it was bad before but it started spreading a few months ago.

Man if House MD was a real doctor he’d probably love my case given all the obvious suspects have been ruled out and I’m still having all the issues.

In the words of my doctor “you’re 25, if you’re in pain there’s something wrong” and it was funny because he said I have the joints of someone over double my age.

The flu has made the headaches horrific to the point where I am in bed all day like I was over a decade ago when I first started getting them, and I am exhausted. I have a dry cough, muscle aches, chills, the works really and with the flu it takes so long to start to even feel slightly better. I'm also super anxious now because I noticed I'm feeling very nauseous, which was a symptom I experienced with my gastritis for two years, and it's so frustrating.

I think a part of me is also sad I can't just do what other people do when they're poorly. Like make some comforting food, or take certain medications to feel better as a lot of it is limited due to my complex needs. So I'm stuck in purgatory until the fog hopefully clears. I just hope I don't end up in hospital like last time as my body is pretty terrible at fighting off illnesses.

1pow5sl,Done with cheap heating pads,"I am officially done with cheap, disposable heating pads. Over the past year I’ve gone through three different ones, and every single one has failed in the same predictable way. Either the wires inside break down so the pad stops heating evenly, or the automatic shut‑off feature kicks in way too early and cuts me off before I get the relief I need.

When you rely on these things for chronic pain management, that kind of failure isn’t just annoying, it’s brutal. Heat therapy is one of the few things that consistently helps me loosen up tight muscles and calm the ache, and losing that crucial half hour of steady warmth feels like someone pulled the rug out from under me. It’s not a luxury item for me, it’s part of how I function day to day.

The worst part is how disposable they’re made to be. You can tell from the flimsy fabric, the thin wiring, and the way the controls feel like they’ll snap if you press them too hard. They’re designed for short‑term use, but marketed like they’ll last. And every time one fails, I end up spending more money replacing it, which adds up fast.

So here’s where I’m stuck: I don’t want to keep throwing money at pads that die after a few months as if I get it from alibaba. I’d rather invest in one solid option that actually lasts.

Seeking Advice: 12+ Months of Undiagnosed Abdominal Pain
First, thank you to anyone who can offer insight. I’ve been struggling with this injury for over a year now and I’m feeling pretty lost.
Timeline:
November 2024 - Initial Injury
	∙	Felt a pull in my stomach while deadlifting
	∙	Went to urgent care to check for hernia
	∙	Primary care doctor ordered ultrasound - came back negative
	∙	However, there was significant tenderness during the ultrasound (about half an inch to the left of my belly button)
	∙	Doctor told me to keep working out
Late November 2024 - Reinjury
	∙	Flared it up again 2 weeks later
	∙	Saw a sports physiologist who diagnosed it as likely an abdominal strain
	∙	Advised to cut lifting volume
	∙	2 weeks later, flared up again
December 2024 - Additional Imaging
	∙	Got a CT scan - also came back negative
	∙	Continued working out, pain persisted
February 2025 - First Surgical Consult
	∙	Saw surgeon at Columbia Hernia Center
	∙	Diagnosed with small umbilical hernia
	∙	Surgeon noted this might not be causing the pain
	∙	Could operate, but no guarantee pain would resolve
March 2025 - Surgery
	∙	Had the operation with 2-month recovery timeline
May 2025 - Pain Returns
	∙	Exactly 2 months post-op, felt the pain again
	∙	Surgeon ordered more imaging
	∙	Mesh intact, no complications from surgery
	∙	Suggested pain could be intermuscular
June/July 2025 - New Direction
	∙	Saw sports medicine doctor in June who said I may never have needed surgery
	∙	Suggested it could be a muscle strain issue
	∙	Started physical therapy for potential abdominal strain
	∙	Initial PT was poor
August - October 2025 - PT Progress & Setback
	∙	Found better physical therapist
	∙	Made progress treating it as abdominal strain
	∙	As soon as I started upper body lifting again, pain came back
	∙	Kept regressing with the injury
Recent - Additional Consultations
	∙	Saw another hernia surgeon who found separation/weakness in abdominal wall on ultrasound
	∙	Consulted with Dr. Coy Kendall in Florida (one of 44 verified surgeons by the American Hernia Society)
	∙	His imaging showed mesh intact, abdominal wall intact
	∙	Found nothing clinical to operate on, no diastasis recti
	∙	Recommended seeking pain medicine doctor
	∙	Essentially left without answers
Current Situation:
	∙	12+ months into this injury
	∙	Dozens of imaging studies done
	∙	Countless doctors consulted
	∙	Still can’t pinpoint the issue
	∙	Just want to get back to lifting weights
Background:
Weightlifting has been crucial to my life - it helped me lose over 100 pounds from my peak of 320+ pounds. Getting back to the gym isn’t just about fitness for me, it’s about maintaining the lifestyle that changed my life.

1pov3ht,My PTSD has been really bad for awhile now. I believe that it distracts me from physical pain. Anyone else find this? Had a reprieve from the PTSD and started having stabbing horrific pain. I went to Urgent Care and they did xrays and said that I should have surgery ASAP (lumbar).,"I have PTSD and have been dealing with my abuser, my ex-husband in court matters for over two years. There is a LOT of fraud and severe misconduct with the attorneys and even the court. The gaslighting has been some of the worst ever (diagnosed in 2008).   
  
We finally had a trial and it was ridiculous. I am filing a motion to vacate so it will go to appellate court eventually. I have been able to let it mentally go some. Within a week, I started having severe stabbing pain.. unable to get dressed, walk, sit, stand, walk.... It was different than my normal chronic pain. Because of the PTSD, I didn't find a new doctor here where I relocated... I should have gotten a new doctor for the pain management but I was too afraid of conflict.   
  
So, I went to Orthopedic Urgent Care hoping to get an injection... they did xrays and say I should have surgery ASAP. My spinal problems have gotten significantly worse. The radiologist said that she found the xrays disturbing and the PA said that if I don't address it, I could lose sensation in being able to know when I need to use the toilet, and could lose sensation to my legs.

1qalvhc,Living in fear of my Aura,"I get migraine with aura several times a year (probably would be much more if I lived a normal life 😭). It is almost always triggered by some sort of exertion or an activity that jostles my brain. Examples: I’ve had one after jumping on a trampoline, workouts, sledding with my kids, bike rides, rock climbing at a gym, yoga, yard work. I now do NOTHING for fear I’ll trigger one. 

My aura symptoms include scintillating scatoma, numbness and tingling in half my body including face, tongue, arm and hand, speech and writing difficulties, confusion, perception hallucinations (like my body doesn’t belong to me and I’m a floating head), nausea and vomiting, panic, followed by moderate pain. My aura can last for several hours with symptoms coming and going. For days afterwards I have derealization and issues with concentration and speaking. It is pure torture every time, and I think I’m going to die. I’ve been to the ER numerous times thinking I was having a stroke, I see a neurologist, have had CT scans and MRIs, and I feel like I’m totally in the dark still with how to manage this. And I have no idea how to prevent it either besides abstaining from every activity! My neurologist has me taking magnesium and I’ve tried Nurtec and Abrevly to stop them once they start with 0% success. 

I no longer do anything! I stopped exercising, I don’t do any activities besides walking and am so anxious all the time that any exertion will trigger one. I’m also afraid of glare and bright lights because that seems to trigger them as well. I just went on a ski trip with my family and spent the weekend in the condo while my husband and kids had the times of their lives because I don’t dare do anything anymore. It’s so depressing. I want to live my life again!!! I want to have fun! I want to be active! This has been going on since my early 20s but has gotten worse as I’ve neared my 40s. 20 years living in fear. I can’t even describe how terrifying it is when they happen. It’s like I lose my vision, my sense of reality, my independence, my ability to communicate. It’s so scary for me. I wish I could just flow through it and move on but it’s terrifying and ruins my life. I’ve even tried therapy to help me deal with the anxiety and anxiety meds. But i’m still stuck!!

Even tho that would be great lmao. And since I booked this vacation when my migraine wasn't daily yet I had the choice of not going or going and missing out on some stuff. But I'd rather lay there in pain with different food than not go at all. 
I didn't mind the long flight, time and climate/ weather change. Yes my back was hurting but the migraine was not the problem here. So overall I had to unfortunately cancel some things I was looking forward to. My stomach also still acted up so I was missing out on food sometimes. But the time in nature and swimming (where my body feels light and my body aches aren't as bad) more like walking slowly in the water lmao, really helped me. Mentally this was needed very much since I was basically locked inside of my apartment for months, missing out on summer except for literally one day 2hours in the sun. 
It was great seeing all the things I saw and doing all the things. Knowing it doesn't matttter what I do I will feel bad anyways. During one physiotherapy massage where I was laying down I felt so bad. But I knew if I was at the hotel I would also be laying down feeling exactly like this. Nothing to be done to make me feel better. 
So the morning was always shit, I could only eat a handful. Noon I always napped during my fatigue. So basically I only had half a day. But then I was more mobile during the rest of the day.  
I went to two live events (sitting) with my glasses and earplugs and that was truly great.

1qacm0r,Migraines Gone,"Not sure is I've posted this last year but I realized I haven't visited this sub for a while and want to make my health report. 

I began going to my doctor for my migraines 6 months ago and after many test my doctor found out that my migraines were connected to my blood pressure which was critically high. I was teetering on having a stroke or heart attack for literally 3 years without knowing. 

I've had migraines for a very long time but as I got older they became more frequent. As a kid I'd have one or 2 a year. As a young adult I got one once a month. In my thirties it was nearly everyday. 

But now my blood pressure medication keeps me from having migraines. It has been quite a journey and I'm so happy to be pain free for the most part. I'm terrified because I know my pain will return without this medication and that at such a young age my body is basically trash. But I'm happy that for now I can rest easy.

Ultimately my doctor said it looks like my migraines were stress and anxiety related and my body basically was on a never end cortisol dump for some reason. I basically was killing myself from stress despite not always being stressed. My body is basically broken, I guess. He also added that covid (which I had 4 times) has caused a long term infection in my body which ramped up the frequency of migraines. 

All in all, I am happy that for now, I'm migraine free and I just want to encourage others to keep fighting and keep looking for answers. You never know when you or your doctor might find the cause and the solution. ",1768169183.0,26,5,migraine,mental_physical

I have daily migraines that haven't been helped by pain relievers, lifestyle changes, propanolol, rizatriptan, sumitriptan, or buspirone. My neurologist insists my ONLY other option is Topamax. I was hesitant because I am very sensitive to medications and have heard bad things about it. I am on day four and have had zero appetite. I'm talking I have eaten barely anything for 3 days and drank maybe a bottle of water each day, if that. I am forgetting everything. I am itchy all over, I am having crazy strong episodes of deja vu that stop me in my tracks, my HR is crazy high, I have come close to fainting multiple times and on top of that it hasn't prevented migraines. He said it will take 3 months to work and I have to titrate up to 400mg. Oh, it also makes all of the soda I drink taste completely flat...

1qa8up8,Help me find the root cause of my migraine,"Hello everyone,

I am a 34 yo male. Since i am 25 i suffer from migraine. When I have migraine im completly bedridden. Mostly it starts in the night, and vomiitting starts shortly after. I also have marfan syndrome and take beta blocker (atenolol 25) for regulating blood pressure. I have seen a neurologist in the past, but he only prescribes triptane, which dont really have an affect on me.

In general I know I should do more for a healthy lifestlye in terms of nutrition and exercise. I am not obese but still sit most of the day in front of my PC.

My history of migraine:

25 yo: I got my first migraine - on the first night I had sex with my first GF. Starting there I had regularly migraine attacks - on average every 2 weeks. I also had the attacks when I wasn't with my girlfriend and I also still had them when we seperated 2 years later. They did a scan of my brain, but couldnt identify any issue. My migraine attacks have always been more frequently in the winter months.

30 yo: Before I started a new job I wanted to start a new initiative to fight my migraine. I had a long-term blood pressure measurement. The result was that my blood pressure rose for no reason in the middle of they day. (I work in HomeOffice). After the result my doctor prescribed me Losartan. I was free of Migraine for around 4 months. But then slowly but surely the migraine came back.

34 yo: In the meantime I had migraine again every 2 weeks. But in december I met a new girl again. Every single time she comes over I have migraine. Every Weekend we meet I have migraine - not every day but atleast every 2nd day we meet. And then I also have migraine on workdays... Since december I have around 3 migraine attacks per weeks. I had another long term blood pressure measurement last week (sadly on a day I felt really well) - that showed no high blood pressure. Yesterday I went to Ikea. During my time there a migraine attack started and I nearly collapsed walking stairs. Back home I was bedridden until 3 hours ago. That was the first time a migraine attack started in the middle of the day.

Currently im just desperate. If my migraine keeps this way I dont know how I should keep my Job.... I just bought a house. I feels like the high frequency of migraine attacks also correlates with me having sex with my girlfriend. But I dont want to chose between having less migraine and being alone...

Do you have any ideas what I should get checked? ",1768160465.0,0,10,migraine,mental_physical

1qa49ey,Black Pepper + Cannabis: My Tiny Tweak for Better Pain Relief (No Tolerance Spike),"Black Pepper + Cannabis: My Tiny Tweak for Better Pain Relief (No Tolerance Spike)

Hey r/AIforHealthGains crew,

As you know from my full chronicle (2018 mold onset → 2025 Aimovig rebound → current protocol updates), I'm always tweaking for chronic migraine/CIRS relief with low-dose cannabis (micro-puffs, low-limonene strains like OG Kush/Northern Lights). One recent add-back: crushing a ¼–½ black peppercorn crumb into each puff/joint around bedtime (e.g., 10:20 PM last night).

Why? Black pepper's loaded with **beta-caryophyllene (BCP)**, the same sesquiterpene abundant in many cannabis strains. BCP acts as a dietary cannabinoid—it selectively binds CB2 receptors (anti-inflammatory pathway) without the CB1 psychoactivity of THC.

From my logs: It drops pain to zero faster/easier, often needing less overall puff (helps manage creeping tolerance). No edgy spikes, no lung issues (lungs feel fine). Pairs perfectly with my low-limonene strains for deeper calm.

Science backs the synergy (entourage effect):
- Preclinical studies show BCP + cannabinoids (like CBD/THC) produce synergistic pain relief in chronic inflammatory/neuropathic models—reducing allodynia, hyperalgesia, and inflammation (TNF-α/IL-1β) more than either alone. (E.g., CBD + BCP combo matched high-dose effects at lower doses.)
- In migraine/chronic pain cohorts, strains high in BCP + myrcene were preferred—potent analgesic/anti-inflammatory without heavy psychoactivity.
- BCP's CB2 activation supports anti-inflammatory/analgesic effects, potentially amplifying cannabis relief while stabilizing tolerance.

Practical how-to from my setup:
- Crush fine, let sit in bowl/chamber 30–60 sec before lighting (terps mingle).
- Half-peppercorn max per puff—simple, cheap, no extras.
- Avoid if lungs tight (rare here).

Not medical advice—always consult a doc. But for anyone microdosing cannabis for pain/fog/inflammation, this low-risk add-on is worth logging. Wins? Losses? Anyone else sprinkle pepper in their smoke?

(Tracked in handovers since Nov 2025—sources in comments if wanted.)

Stay logging, stay gaining. One small spice at a time. 🌶️🚀

He prescribed me Sydolil which is not available in the US (ETA I've since learned it is in fact available in the US). I brought back a 3 month supply and have been taking it once every 12 hours. I do think it’s helping but on the flight back home I noticed a painful feeling of intense pressure on my head that wasn’t there before or after the flight. Curious if anyone else has tried it or even traveled to another country to seek treatment and/or a second opinion. Thanks and wishing everyone a happy new year filled with migraine relief!

1qa3ex3,Migraines blamed for unrelated symptoms,"Im not asking for advice, just wondering if anyone has dealt with the same frustrating situation. I have been to several doctors for this, and i am not asking medical advice at all!



 I DO get migraines. I am on two different meds for it and my rescue has worked wonders, haven't had a migraine since November. However, I was originally seen at Neurology for suspicions from several doctors on MS. I, however, only have 1 lesion, and my optic nerves (suspected optic neuritis) weren't inflamed by the time I received my MRI. My Neuro chalked it all up to migraines (I know they cause wild symptoms but I dont and haven't ever had aura, and it lasts months!) Also keep in mind that during all of my symtoms, I didnt even have a slight headache. I couldn't walk properly, was weak, couldn't talk, both arms and legs numb, nearly blind in one eye, etc.

  
Have any of you had migraines as a cover all diagnosis until receiving an actual one? OR has anyone had such insane migraines that they were mistaken, even by yourself, for something different? I am just trying to make some sense of this. If this is not allowed please delete, but asking for everyone else's experience if they went through anything similar.

1qa0i8e,I finally have some answers after changing doctors,"This is a PSA to everyone to go to a different doctor and get a second opinion if you’re not getting any answers. I (30F) have been suffering from migraines since I was a teenager. No doctors I’ve seen have been able to give me any answers besides its migraines. I’ve alway had a gut feeling it’s been more than just that. I’ve tried and failed a shit load of meds only to be told ‘there’s nothing more we can do for you’. I’ve had two brain MRIs in my life and both times the doctors said everything was normal. Most recently, I have done one round of Botox which has helped but not much. I blow through my rizatriptan script as soon as I get it basically, and muscle relaxers help but not completely. The neurologist I was seeing was horrible to say the least. He didn’t care, he didn’t listen, he’d talk to me for 5 seconds and pass me off to his nurse bc he couldn’t be bothered listening to what meds (his FNP) prescribed me that I’ve tried and failed. As my neurologist, shouldn’t you know my F’ing chart? Anyway, I finally had enough. I complained about him to his office and got squeezed in with my mom’s neurologist who wasn’t accepting new patients, but made an exception. 

What a relief!!!! This woman is amazing. Apparently my MRI was not normal. She told me I have Cerebellar tonsillar ectopia which is a form of a Chiari malformation (I always had a feeling I did, especially bc my mom had one). She also diagnosed me with bilateral occipital neuralgia and she’s going to have me tested for neuropathy. 

As far as treatment, we are continuing the Botox, rizatriptan, and muscle relaxers. She is going to try and get my insurance to approve nerve blocks and she’s going to have me try Reyvow and Zavzpret. If I fail those as well she said she’s willing to prescribe me Fioricet. Finally!!!!! someone who listened to me and didn’t make me feel like an idiot for asking about medications and conditions that I’ve done a ton of research on. 

If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading. I’m so over the moon to finally have some answers and to finally be heard and validated.

1q9ylvz,does anyone else have nonstop auras,"this feels insane trying to track at this point, but in 2025 i had 2 days i did not have 24 hour auras. 90% of the time they are painless but sometimes the auras can get bad enough i feel like i'm having a stroke. having a migraine is my default state of being at this point. usual symptoms are yawning, brain fog, runny nose from posture changes or light exercise (incredibly low viscosity, almost like water), visual snow & afterimages, anxiety, some nausea (usually only when exposed to particularly nasty trash/human feces), visual disturbances at night, especially while driving. bad ends of the symptoms are hypovolemic feeling/weakness in limbs (happened after i got nexplanon in), nose and/or half of face tingling/numbness, tingling up occipitals, stumbling over my words, dulled sense of touch. known triggers are dehydration, barometric pressure, THC, and whatever they put in fog machines. 

i've been through so many meds (nurtec, rizatriptan, ajovy, emgality, sumatriptan, ubrelvy, qulipta) and what happens is they help (as in, lessen my symptoms, they never stop them) for maybe a year and then my body starts resisting them. it got to the point that rizatriptan was making them \*worse\*, and by the time i got approved for qulipta, i had already developed resistance to the other -gepants (ubrelvy, nurtec).

i'm scared of getting botox because i have hEDS and am worried about getting CCI. i got an MRI and it was completely fine. i feel like there's no hope for me and i don't know what to do. i don't want to take ibuprofen every time i get them because i would be taking it every day and potentially start resisting it. i'm only in my 20s and have an extensive medical history & they run in my genetics, i don't know anyone else who deals with these symptoms as frequently as i do and i can tell my employer is not scheduling me more because i keep having to call out.",1768135893.0,3,5,migraine,mental_physical

Is anyone else dealing with this right now? Does anyone else have any tips for rebound or anything?

Just got a letter in my insurance app saying the Botox is covered! I had read something that united was in talks with a secondary company they worked with last year back in December and it fell through on the 31st so I guess they needed all the paperwork my Dr had sent to them previously because that secondary company handled the prescriptions and prior authorization requests? 

I don't work in insurance or anything so I don't fully understand it but this is what I was told/ gathered from talking to people. Looks like I'll hopefully be able to get in this week which is good as I've been feeling so sick the past 5 days.

1q9jnyv,Anyone else experiencing chronic headaches on top of episodic migraines?,"I’ve had constant headache since 2017. It’s always there, usually a pressing band across my forehead, eyes and temples, together with severe tension in my neck and shoulders. On my best days it’s around 4–5/10, on bad days 8–9/10 with dizziness, brain fog and sometimes visual static. A few times I’ve even fainted.

Stress, cold air on my forehead, physical exertion, too much sensory input, alcohol and strong emotions make it worse. I’ve tried many preventives (amitriptyline, beta-blockers, candesartan, topiramate, CGRP blocker), painkillers, triptans, gabapentin, physiotherapy, massage, acupuncture, TENS, rehab programs – you name it! And nothing has touched the constant baseline pain. Sumatriptan may help some of the worst flares, but only the ones more resembling migraines. I still have the tension-type headache every single minute of the day though.

First I was told it was chronic tension-type headache, later chronic migraine, and most recently a pain specialist thinks it’s mainly central sensitization / nociplastic pain (meaning my nervous system itself is generating and amplifying pain signals) with episodic migraine on top.

I've been back and forth with my doctor trying to get approved for CGRP blockers ever since. I finally have that approval, just waiting on my insurance to come through. I now believe the ""return"" of my migraines is actually a change in how migraine shows up in my body due to early perimenopause. Shortly after these migraines started happening, I had very extreme changes in my menstrual cycle, I started experiencing histamine dumping (one or the other ear turning bright red and hot to the touch at ""random"" times (usually in the evenings), irritability, and other issues that are strongly associated with hormonal instability. I am open to believing it is some other hormonal issue than perimenopause, but it is absolutely hormonal and there is currently no better explanation.

In the meantime, I could barely work for two months because looking at a word processor, the stress of work pressure, and the deep focus required for my work would trigger migraines very quickly. I have also been dealing with eye strain issues for the past couple years. Incidentally, a friend of mine in her late 40s who is also a migraineur has also been dealing with disabling eye strain and informed me that 20/20/20 (when you are working on a screen, or reading, every 20 minutes you try to look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds) was extremely effective for her in combination with some other eye therapy. I was skeptical but desperate for a solution so I tried it out. 

Lo and behold, I am now able to look at a screen for a full workday. I'm no longer constantly rubbing my eyes, dealing with extreme blurred vision or the sensation of dry eyes. I was very pleased with this, but absolutely shocked to discover I also now do not get migraines. They just stopped. Don't get me wrong, I am still a chronic migraineur and I cycle through prodrome on a daily basis. I get migraine ""warning signs"" all the time. I still need access to a medication that will take me out of the danger zone. It's exhausting to constantly be on guard against an incoming migraine. The prelude is there. But the migraine is not happening and I absolutely attribute this to 20/20/20.

For interested people, I practice this religiously. I have an app on my phone that plays an alarm every 20 minutes. The alarm runs 20 seconds and I look away from my screen for the full period without fail. I never skip it. I would never remember to do it without an alarm so this is key for me, but any alarm will do. I am not rigid about 20 feet away because I don't always have something 20 feet away to look at, but I will find the furthest point from me and ""examine"" it closely but without strain for the full duration. I often extend it past the 20 seconds to have a good look around the room, try to count things I see, read a book title on a shelf, note how many colours are in my line of sight, name the objects, etc. If I'm feeling a little extra pressure I will do it more frequently than every 20 minutes. I'll look every 10, or whatever (but never ignore the alarm). If I feel a twinge in my forehead, I'll look away then too and it stops it.  

I have not had a migraine since I started doing this. My light sensitivity is greatly reduced. I can have my curtains open again and look at a screen in a naturally lit room without feeling like my retinas are burning. I can have lamps on, I can tolerate overhead lighting (though I never choose it because ew). 

I have this alarm on all the time. It's a quiet jingle so usually only I notice it. It's on while I'm working, watching a movie, gaming, reading, crafting, anything that involves close focus. I do not ever look at something close up for longer than 20 minutes. 

I do not believe this will work if you are not religious about it. If you're going to try it, do it all the way. And I have no idea if it will work for many people. That's a million different migraine states and types and triggers. But this works for me and I'm now able to go to work and make money and live a real life instead of being shut in a dark room while waiting for my insurance to come through on the medication I need.

I have since us my doctor to cut the medicine from 25 mg to 0 mg in 2 weeks time and approval was given. in short this medicine may not be the best for people who has high discomfort or photophobia, however it may be good if there are pain is not on the eye but other region and is triggered by other stuff.",1768029305.0,0,0,migraine,mental_physical

1q8q5g8,"Free from Migraine & Mood Swings (for now, knock on wood)","I wanted to come back to this sub-red because I know how flooded reddit can be with more (-) or question-seeking audiences, especially when it comes to managing a chronic illness.

  
I had migraines for the first time last year in January. A few weeks before I had MDD. So the migraines started soon after my episode. During this time, I would get migraines along with a depressive mood swing (that I thought were just all depression because I've never had MDD before).

  
Anyways, I am here now, 10 days and continuing migraine free days, when I should have already had (2) due to the frequency I am used to.

What I took:

\- AJOVY (4th injection soon)

\- Ami (now at 50 mg, per night)

\- Bupropion 150mg XL (due to serotonin-induced apathy)

\- Magnesium 480 mg (specifically glycinate! I did not know this matter, but this was very helpful and was the last thing I needed to stop the migraines. Before was taking a mix of magnesium or mainly magnesium threonate)

  
All these interventions made the depressive-weekly migraine attacks lighter, but I would still have the depression and recovery lasting a few days. What made the final difference was the magnesium glycinate that reduced the frequency down to 0.

  
My brain is still recovering after a year of migraine-depressive insult, but as I continue to keep myself migraine free my brain will learn a healthier default (no longer in a tiny low mood here and there), but a default of normal baseline with these preventative treatments after a few months.

  
Do not settle for a reduction of intensity, or a slight reduction in frequency. Try to seek out a temporary remission. From what I learned, each migraine begets another migraine, but if you figure out the combination that works for you to put these migraines in remission, it will give your brain enough time to get out of its depressive mood swings and be on your way to a healthier baseline. The journey of recovery is gonna take me some time, but I wanted to reach out and be open with anyone struggling to get out.",1768007030.0,21,9,migraine,mental_physical

Whenever I’m on my period especially in the first few/worst days, I noticed that my ADHD meds feel less effective which isn’t surprising to me bc of everything periods do to you everywhere. However, yesterday, I took my meds (Vyvanse) and felt like they did nothing and my brain/focus felt similar to how I feel during those first days of my period which was very confusing bc I’m not on my period and not expecting to be again for quite some time (not soon enough for it to be PMS related). Later on, I got an attack that still hasn’t been completely relieved, so I’m wondering if there’s potentially some connection to be made and if anyone else has experienced anything similar.

I am really trying to get a better understanding and hold on identifying and tracking my prodrome symptoms, so if this could potentially be one, it would make a huge difference in possibly blunting or preventing an attack.

My neuro wants me to try Botox bc I get migraines 363 days a year basically. 

I’m very worried for the following reasons

1. I have 2 kids under 3 and was told I can’t bend for 6 hours after, I have no help with the kids, I will NEED to bend to pick them up

2. I read people get worse migraines for a week after sometimes. I work and watch both kids at the same time. I do not get sick days. I’d be so fucked if I am in worse pain. I’m barely living as it is with the stress of 2 kids plus wfh.

3. I sleep very badly already and was told I need to sleep sitting up the first night. As I don’t get time off or help this means less sleep for me already getting maybe 4-5 hours tops as is.

Sometimes I look like I’m going crazy just looking around the room, trying to map out whether I’m having an actual migraine, or the auras are just in my eyes for the time being. I only know that a real migraine is coming on when the aura starts to grow and I go blind. Does anyone else deal with this constantly? I know that I’ve been really stressed out lately, and that this is a result of it, I’d just really appreciate some advice.

I don't know how to explain it, but all the pain sort of blends together, so I can't tell if i feel less or more pain an hour after taking something, or even a week after. I know for sure that i'm in less pain than I was years back thanks to my current medications, but telling short term is much harder for me.
does anybody have any advice on keeping track so I can tell if something is working? I could probably keep a log where I rate the pain out of 10 but that hasn't really worked for me in the past. thanks in advance :)",1767995862.0,1,2,migraine,mental_physical
1q8juu3,I hate migraines sm,"So ive been dealing with migrains since early 2024. They started off to be super bad that id have to miss school. It w9uld only happen 3 times in a year. Then I started beauty school in aug. 2024 and I had a migraine every month with the vomiting every time. After 5 months of this, I went to the doctor. I got put on meds and it seemed to help only a little. She prescribed me Nurtec ODT. It works 30% of the time. But it works good as a preventive even though it's an abortion med. 

Last night and into early today has been bad. I was watching a movie (which is a trigger if I watch it for too long) and I felt a migraine come on. I dont get any aura nor warning signs. It just starts. So I went to bed and woke up around 4:30 in the morning. I knew something felt wrong. So I took the bathroom trash can with me to my room. I was awake for 2 hours and every few minutes id throw up. When a migraine comes on, my digestive system doesn't digest food or at least, not all of it. So that food sits there and it later comes up. It got to a point that later, when i woke up again to clean the trash bin, there was a blood clot from how much I dry heaved.

1q8gsmz,RCVS/Thunderclap Headaches,"Hi fellow migraine sufferers. 

I have had a couple of experiences with thunderclap headaches (3 in the past week). On the third occurrence (yesterday) I went to A&E and they did a CT scan which came up normal/clear. 

They did also pick up a sinus infection but didn’t think that would be a cause for the headaches but couldn’t put it down to anything else. 

The doctor did say however, than when I had my CT it was around 12 hours after the thunderclap headache, and any changes would only show up for 6 hours after the headache so they’ve given me antibiotics for the sinus infection and have said if I experience another one I need to come straight back so they can repeat the scan within 6 hours. They did also say they could perform a spinal tap but at that stage, I’d been at the hospital for 6 hours and I just wanted to go home! 

I’ve been googling since and I suspect it could be RCVS. I don’t smoke, don’t drink, am generally healthy so I don’t think I have any of the other risk factors other than taking triptans, being a migraine sufferer and being on SSRI’s. 

I am really worried - does anyone else have any experience with RCVS? Is it possible for the CT to show up clear even if I have RCVS? Could there be another explanation for the headaches? 

If anyone has any personal experience with RCVS or thunderclap headaches, I’d be really grateful for some insight on your personal experience. ",1767984722.0,1,1,migraine,mental_physical

Been on Ajovy since 2024. Ajovy brought me down to 6-8 migraine days a month initially, and I was taking nurtec as a PRN / rescue med along with elyxyb as a rescue for severe migraine days (maybe 1-2x per month) 

I recently moved states and switched insurance and to a new provider 

Prior to my move, I noticed an increase in migraine days even with Ajovy and nurtec

I had a three-year-long migraine from 2020 to 2023. After finally seeking medical attention, I got put on topiramate. It was a godsend after three years of migraine.

For quick context: I have been diagnosed with chronic migraine. I'm never not in pain. I wake up in pain, I go to bed in pain and the pain just varies in intensity by day. It's been this way for about 7 years straight. I wish I was being hyperbolic, but I feel like with this group I don't actually have to say that because I feel like most would believe me and understand without that statement, but I digress. 

I go through my days, I push through work, outings, dates, cooking, chores, you name it. Even on my worst days. Especially with work because I don't get PTO, so if I miss work, I just don't get paid. (Granted, and thankfully, my work is super understanding and accommodating when I do have to call out or leave early. So that's nice.)

So that's where my questions come in: am I either just not as in pain as I think I am? Or am I just so used to having to push through to have any kind of existence that my pain tolerance is just more than I realize? Etc., etc.

Don't get me wrong, there *are* days where pushing through is just not an option, but now I'm wondering if I'm coming across as faking because of how high functioning I can be on a daily basis. I feel like the only people that see the worst of things are my closest friends, my partners, and my roommates.

I guess I'm just looking for commiseration or for people that function like this as well to tell me I'm not crazy for feeling like this?

I was usually able to treat them by taking medicine and being in a cold, dark, and quiet room. They followed me into my teens and early 20s, I always assumed they were just tension headaches. Unfortunately I never got to see a doctor about them.

Anyway, I never got any auras ahead of time that indicated I was about to get one. It would just start, and then ramp up quickly if I didn't do anything to subdue it. Recently I got my first aura, a rainbow zigzag in my vision that just kept growing. It lasted about half an hour before I got this really intense feeling of dizziness/feeling faint (I don't remember) and I ended up falling over. I felt weak too. To be honest, I thought I was having a stroke haha but paramedics cleared me and so did a quick visit to the ER.

The crazy part is that I never got a headache and everything subsided within 10-15 minutes. I'm just wondering if anyone's had their migraines change or perhaps had something similar happen to them?

its absolutely miserable and family still takes the time to joke about how ill never move out and that ill be on disability forever. it’s upsetting that thats the only thing they think of me, i didn’t want to be disabled.

it’s feels like how i imagine dementia feels like, i can’t remember anything. i forget what I’m saying halfway through sentences. i cant do the things i love without feeling sick

1q7vtjp,I can't explain this,"In the summer, I got a three month long migraine after trying a zinc supplement. I must have taken too much for my sensitive nervous system and it just wrecked me. I couldnt go to the gym without getting dizzy, couldnt balance my electrolytes, etc. I finally got back on my old antidepressant (citalopram) and MIRACULOUSLY, it stopped the migraine within a week. It was a hellish three months working an awful outdoor job in the heat with a pounding head everyday. No idea why or how it worked, when nurtec and sumatriptan did nothing.

Fast forward to this winter, I got the same feeling migraine about a week after getting the flu. Same thing where triptans and nurtec didnt work. I'm still taking citalopram at this point. I had a suspicion that the citalopram was making me feel worse when I got this migraine, because I would feel ""okay"" until about an hour after I took it in the morning. So I skipped one morning to take it in the evening instead. And I felt SO MUCH BETTER during the day. Much less pain, pressure and throbbing, much less brain fog and I actually had some motivation to leave the house multiple times lol. Ive had this migraine for almost a month now, and I've significantly lowered my citalopram dose and am feeling much better. To the point where I dont want to take it anymore. I wish I could quit it cold-turkey, but I know that's not a good idea. I'll take a low-low dose for a couple weeks and see how i feel when I stop.

I just know none of the doctors I see will have any answers for me, but thats fine, I just have to go with the flow at this point. I've spent the last 4/7 months with a migraine so honestly I dont care what it takes to feel normal. Brains are so wack ",1767925252.0,1,4,migraine,mental_physical

Midodrine (BP raising med) helped my BP and took away my lightheadedness it was amazing but the vasoconstriction effect is a trigger for my headaches and migraines so I had to stop taking it. I’m currently on Fludrocortisone to help me retain fluids and sodium which I get around 3000mg and am increasing it to 4000mg+ but 3000mg is doing nothing for my BP (which rarely gets to 105/65 max) and lightheadedness. That being said candesartan was suggested as a possible preventative option which I turned down bc of my BP issues and took gabapentin (not helping) instead. I don’t want something that will lower BP if I’m trying to get my BP up that seems counter productive

The neurologist increased my Propranolol and i had to wait a bit to get approved for Rizatriptan by insurance. He also ordered MRI testing in a few months. 

It is almost comical that while I was waiting, I had the worst migraine in my entire life. I don't say that word lightly. But it was defiantly the worst migraine I've experienced. I literally started praying to god to ease the pain (I'm an ex muslim). by the second day I was able to drag myself to the washroom to brush my teeth and wash my face and when I looked at my face I noticed the right side of my forehead vein is bulging. Exactly where the pain is (and behind the eye). This has never happened before and it freaked me out. It passed now and I just got my prescription of Rizatriptan from my pharmacy.

Before Qulipta, I was only on Nurtec and ended up with a 30+ day migraine (I honestly lost count), which landed me in the hospital for a migraine infusion and a course of prednisolone.

Now I feel like I’m back at square one…. Daily headaches and very frequent migraines, Nurtec no longer works for me, and Qulipta doesn’t seem to be preventing them either. I’ve also tried sumatriptan, rizatriptan, amitriptyline, and Ubrelvy without much success.

1q7sv5l,One side gets most migraines. Is it affecting my entire side?,"Hi All.

After discovering that I can no longer get myself up off the floor without some kind of help, I decided to start physical therapy and also signed on to a popular gym. 

I had a progress check done at PT today and my therapist said my left side was trash. Ouch, but true. I've been stumbling more lately and have fallen a couple times. Balancing on my right leg is still not great; I lasted for 25 seconds; my left leg? 3-6 seconds (We kept trying to see if I'd do better.)

But what is weird is that I get most of my migraines on the left. My left eye is carried by my right eye. And now it seems I cannot develop any strength on my left side. My MRIs come back normal. I'm also left handed. 

Anyone else dealing with something similar? This is just so weird to me and I'm not sure what to do about it. (After months of PT, I still can't get up on my own.)

I believed the weakness came from me spending nearly all my time in bed due to chronic migraines, arthritis, fibromyalgia... you get the idea. (No option in my room for chairs and I gotta relax in bed a lot rather than sitting up.) I am taking quite a few medications and I know at least one has weight gain as a side effect. So I'm left wondering if my noodle arms and legs do not have the strength to move my new weight around. (I was around 140lbs and now I'm just over 200lbs.)

Due to things outside my control, I can't change my diet to be healthier.

1q7sh2m,Safe to say my preventative isn’t helpful,"I analyzed the data from my migraine tracker to see if things were getting better or worse so I can share that with the pain clinic I see next week and my specialist at the end of the month. To preface this I have a headache everyday that is a 5-6/10 that is pressure and a bit painful but not anything intolerable or that I’d want to take an abortive for (if I could, none work). 7-8/10 is painful these are my migraines, stabbing, throbbing, nerve-y/ electric, etc painful I wish I could take something for them. I’m sure my increased migraine frequency is due to the cold weather but I’m not outside often at all. I go to work 2 days a week I’m indoors for that and I’m in my house every day I’m not at work bc of my headaches and migraines so I don’t think that’s the reason they’re worse but surely they shouldn’t be getting worse with a preventative (that has not helped). I’m seeing the pain clinic next Wednesday to discuss TPIs (Botox worked for 8 rounds then stopped working), I go to PT every week that doesn’t seem to be helping much I started that in October. I’m frustrated. My follow up with my specialist (unless she has someone else form her team speak with me bc she has beef with me for ratting her out to her medical board but that’s another story) is at the end of January and idk if it’s worth increasing my gabapentin bc it’s making zero difference. I can’t do any of the CGRP injections and she has no abortives left to offer me. I got toradol and Tylenol 2 from the walk in but those do nothing. I’m sick of this I’ll be coming on 7 years of this daily in February.

September: 10 days (10 total)

October: 12 days (13 total)

November: 7 days (7 total)

December: 21 days (31 total events)

Monday i started a new job which is 10 hours looking at a computer screen and at night i saw the same flashing triangles in a C shape only this time it took up most of my vision and lasted 20-30 minutes. i was really freaked out and googling it. i had some prior knowledge of migraine with aura being a thing and settled on it being that. i thought maybe it was a one off but then i had one again the next day. i went two days without one and today i had another one. it usually happens when a combination of things occurs 1) im staring at a screen/bright light for a long time and 2) im hungry

They've created a portal where you can look up any FDA reports available for the facility that produces your generic medication: [https://projects.propublica.org/rx-inspector/guided-search/](https://projects.propublica.org/rx-inspector/guided-search/)

When I looked up the sumatriptan pills I get through Kaiser Permanente, the most recent inspection in 2023 notes [extensive concerns](https://projects.propublica.org/rx-inspector/facilities/3002949099/) related to:

* contamination that would alter the safety, identity, strength, quality or purity of the drug product, such as with hair, microbes, fungus, and foreign objects,
* lack of adequate regular evaluation of equipment conditions,
* deficient conformance to written specifications for testing,
* failure to investigate deviations such as batch failure and recalled failing batches in a timely manner,
* no corrective action taken to avoid similar events in the future,
* use of laboratory equipment that failed to meet routine calibration specifications,
* failure to investigate consumer complaints thoroughly,
* lack of adequate employee training and evaluation,
* and the use of test methods for which accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility have not been established

While the FDA determined the facility can correct these issues voluntarily, they found similar issues repeatedly in 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2020.

One of my main symptoms of my VM disabling vertigo attacks that lasted upwards of 19 hours at a time. Daily. This was nearly eliminated when I started treatment on Candesartan. But I've had a few vertigo attacks pop up in the last year. This is obviously my biggest concern of how my body will react, which I know it shouldn't... 

Does anyone have any honest stories/feedback, good or bad, with their first treatment of Botox?

Edit for update: It was actually not bad at all; I barely felt any of the injections. In fact my neuro told me that in their experience, the most painful injection sight is in inner corners of the eyes. I asked if they could let me know when it's going to be that spot (she was doing my forehead) and she laughed and told me it's already done!

I did/do have a slight headache after, but this feels like... a normal headache! A little bit of discomfort at the injection sights but not bad.

1q7j61a,Just had my first scintillating scotoma that disappeared suddenly rather than my usual fade. How common is this?,"I've been having scintillating scotomas for about 10 years (only ever had a few migraines years ago, just for reference). The way it always works is I gradually become aware of a small blind spot. If I close my eyes I can better isolate a little bean with some slight color and I know that it's going to gradually increase in size to a throbbing polychromatic demogorgon amoeba and will reach a peak and then gradually fade back out. The usual cycle for this right about 30 minutes from first noticing it to no longer noticing it. Some few have stretched to 45. But always it's this seed to growth to peak to fade. 

But today I had my first in a year and I set my timer as usual when I noticed it, because I like to log these things to track and analyze them, but I noticed at 20 minutes it was suddenly just gone. No fade this time. We went from bean to dragon to gone.

How unusual is a sudden disappearance like that? Google says 20-30 minutes is a pretty normal range, but this is my shortest at 20 and I'm most curious about the sudden disappearance, just since that's a novelty for me instead of the fade in and fade out.",1767895819.0,3,0,migraine,mental_physical

1q7ihxq,Discovered a new trigger: topical retinol.,"FYI for those of you that use topical retinol!

Over the past week, I've been ramping up retinol use. At the same time, my migraines were worsening, and most of them were accompanied by awful tension in my neck and shoulders. Migraines are gonna migraine and ebb and flow, so I didn't put the two together.

Yesterday I adhered to my bland migraine diet and felt better until I cleaned my face for the night. Almost immediately after applying retinol, my head began to hurt. 

""WTF,"" I thought. ""So much for eating perfectly today.""

 I walked out the bathroom and saw fireworks in my upper left visual field. It was the worst visual aura I've ever had. 

""WTF!"" What if it was my skincare? I googled Vitamin C serum and didn't find anything. Then I googled 'retinol causing migraines' and quickly found several Reddit posts about retinol as migraine and neck tension trigger. Wow wow wow. I immediately returned to the bathroom and gave my face a good scrubbing, then applied an everyday peptide and moisturizer. Right away, the sharp pain in my head subsided but didn't disappear. This morning, I awoke feeling better than I have in days.

Never in a million years would I guess retinol is a trigger. I'd never even considered that topical things could be triggers. ",1767894444.0,12,19,migraine,mental_physical
1q7i1m2,Need some advice,I've been struggling with chronic migranes since i've been in middle school. I'm now in college and have a neurologist who I see to help treat my migranes. Something that has been a struggle with me is taking excedrine too often or just taking abortative meds too often in general so this time my neurologist has made it apparent that I cut down my usage to them to two or three days a week. She also started me on qulipta to see if that could help aid me when it comes to backing off the abortative meds. I've been on qulipta for abt 3 to 4 months and in the beginning it was really making a difference and while I was still dealing with my migranes often they were less severe and I would have at least 2 days a week that would be completely migrane free but recently it has gone down to only 2 days a month if even that. Recently its been pretty bad with me having more migranes than not but because im scared to fall back into that habit of medication overuse i've been jst forcing myself to deal with the pain which has been taking a major toll on me mentally.

I’m a 25-year-old male living in NYC. About a year ago, I started getting migraine-like headaches occasionally (maybe once a week or every other week). Over time, they became more frequent and more persistent.



Typically when I wake up, I feel a lot of pressure in/behind my nose and around my head/brain. What used to be occasional has now turned into almost weekly headaches that can last for days at a time. The symptoms seem to vary and right now I have constant head pressure along with slight face/cheek tingling. Most of the time it feels like a tight “headband” of pressure around my head.



This has honestly taken over my life. It’s very rare that I feel completely normal anymore.



I’ve seen an ENT and had my sinuses checked - they said it doesn’t look like sinus issues or allergies. I wear a nightguard and don’t really feel jaw tightness during the day, so TMJ doesn’t seem obvious either.



At this point I’m feeling pretty stuck and frustrated. Has anyone experienced something similar or found anything that helped? Any direction on what kind of specialist to see or what to look into would be greatly appreciated.

So I was recently prescribed Ketorolac and basically trying it out, the first time I was so dizzy and nauseated I basically passed out for the day, So I couldn't gauge if it actually worked. However much better than the Sumatriptan I tried before, which just made me feel sick and for some reason made my headache worse.

I figured I needed to eat a bit more when I take it so my stomach doesn't get too upset? I basically really needed it to get through the holidays and travel. First couple hours a bit dizzy and nausea but totally manageable.  Day two, I woke up feeling a bit of tension around my head, took one, then went about the day feeling that tension 'hovering' to which day three was just pain upon opening my eyes. which reminded me to log it in my app, which then told me not to take meds more than two in row.... or rebound headache... Which you'd think I SHOULD KNOW, but somehow conveniently forgot...

I lost a day, but as usual as nighttime comes it calms down enough to function for a few hours... 

The next day after that, I thought since I skipped a day maybe I could take one to function for the day and yes I managed with that tension pain 'hovering' for the day. But I could mostly function like a normal person so I thought it was a win. The next day. It worked... for a few hours and then just stopped and headache was just weird. It was like a wave. It slowly came and then after a lay down nap it slowly ebbed away enough for me to function a few more hours until it slowly came back again... To which I just took a hot shower and called it a day.

Today is once again the third day, which I'm not taking any med and ofc I woke up to a headache. It feels weird, like I feel it in my neck and head is heavy, but there's this big ball of tension that feels like it's in the middle of my head, between my ears. It kind of feels like how your ears pop? That stuffy feeling? I also kind of feel it in the top of my throat, slightly suffocating feeling. Head hurts more when I move it. ofc with the usual nausea, dizziness, vertigo and ear ringing I get everytime I wake up.

A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with migraine, prescribed zolmitriptan (which, by the way, never helped). At that doctor's appointment, I had a severe throbbing pain that prevented me from living

It's been a couple of years since then, and I've noticed that I have these kinds of severe seizures very rarely, maybe once every couple of months. Much more often (4-10 times a month) I encounter fairly mild pain, maybe 1-2/10, which increases with movement and pulsates on one side. At first, the head just presses, and after a few hours it starts to throb

However, this is completely different from the pain that many people face on this subreddit. I don't have an aura, I don't vomit, the pain isn't so bad that I can't do anything, although sometimes the sounds and light around me really annoy me. I learned a lot about migraines from here, but now I'm not sure if I have a migraine at all or if it's a different kind of pain and I was misdiagnosed. When I have pain, I usually take ibuprofen 200 or 400, and my friend told me that this is a fairly low dosage for migraines, although it usually helps me.

1q72y6a,Cervicogenic headaches & occipital migraines — feeling stuck and losing hope,"Hey everyone,

I’m honestly at a point where I don’t know where else to turn, so I figured I’d try here.

I’m 27 and for the past two years I’ve been dealing with what my doctor calls cervicogenic headaches, and sometimes they turn into occipital migraines.

Most of the time it feels like a heavy head and a dull, pulling, pressure-type pain at the back of my head, especially in the suboccipital area. I also get pain that shoots into my left temple, like a sharp, stabbing or pinching sensation. My neck, shoulders, and even mid-back are always stiff, and sometimes the pain goes into my jaw too. On bad days, about once a week, it starts first thing in the morning and slowly turns into a full migraine.

The worst part is that movement makes it worse.

Gym, home workouts, posture exercises, even things that are supposed to help usually trigger headaches instead. After any kind of workout, I can feel awful for the next three to four days with that tension headache, fatigue, dizziness and weakness. Because of that, I can’t stay consistent with anything.

I’ve tried a lot already. Acupuncture, massage therapy, osteopath, chiropractor, physio. Nothing has helped long-term, and some things actually made the headaches worse. My posture isn’t great, but whenever I try to correct it with exercises my head pain flares up. 

I’ve had a full check-up with my family doctor, lots of blood tests, and saw a neurologist. Everything came back normal. The neurologist suggested drinking more water (lol) and taking supplements like B2 and CoQ10. I’ve been taking them, but I honestly can’t tell if they’re doing anything. From what I understand, they’re more helpful (if even helpful) for classic migraines than cervicogenic headaches.

What’s really getting to me is how much this has changed my life. I used to be very active. Hiking, dancing, gym, skiing. Now almost everything comes with tension headaches and fatigue afterward. I feel trapped in a body that doesn’t feel like mine anymore, and it’s honestly heartbreaking.

Lately I’ve been reading about Botox, trigger point injections, and nerve blocks, but I’m losing hope and don’t know if I’m even looking in the right direction.

If anyone here has dealt with cervicogenic headaches, occipital pain, or headaches triggered by exercise or posture work, I would really appreciate hearing what helped you, even a little. I don’t want to give up being active. I just want my life back.

Some insight would be very appreciated. I haven't changed diet, medications, sleep patterns, environment or anything like that. Other than this past week, ive never had a aura migraine.

1q70fx8,Does anyone else feel like the more you understand your migraines the worse they are?,"I don't mean the pain or intensity necessarily, but the overall experience. 

For example, I used to think in the prodrome phase (before I knew what that was), oh I'm just feeling off, or maybe I'm dehydrated, maybe I didn't sleep well. I'll try some ibuprofen, I'll be fine. 

Now I KNOW that ""feeling off"" means the dullness behind my right eye, that slightly nauseous feeling, the fact that my ears can't hear as well today, the sudden constant yawning, etc., there's a GOOD chance a migraine is coming and excedrin and ibuprofen will do NOTHING. 

Or, another example, I didn't know it was nausea I was feeling until someone (incorrectly) told me, ""it's not a migraine if there's no nausea"", but now I understand that THAT feeling is nausea and it's like it feels stronger and worse now that I know what it is.

It's like my brain used to be able to block some things out because I didn't understand what was happening, but know that I know what each feeling is, I can't block it out anymore and I experience every part more fully. 

It used to be a dull, general bad feeling, but now it's the blade behind my right eye, the pressure on the top right side of my head, the pressure in my ears, the nausea in my stomach, etc., and with each sensation I have more clarity and more awareness of what's happening, which just makes it more awful. 

Anyone else ever think about this?

I could really go on. I think people must think I’m crazy sometimes when I’ve said smells trigger migraines for me. I miss wearing perfume and lighting candles. (I still can but the candle has to be like cupcake or something light) I miss being able to smell smells without triggering a migraine!!

For ~14 years I’ve had reproducible episodes triggered by running, cardio, or working outside, especially in heat/humidity (sometimes heat alone). After exertion I get a pulsating migraine synced to my heartbeat, feel very weak, overheated (no fever), mentally foggy, and like my nervous system shuts down. My blood sugar has dropped to 60 mg/dL during these episodes. Symptoms improve with food + salt (burger/fries/salty foods), then I crash into 10–12 hours of deep but non-restorative sleep. The next day I feel groggy with tingling in fingers and low energy. Cold weather helps.

I also get dark circles/sunken eyes as migraines come on, and frequent urination after episodes. Naproxen helps, Tylenol doesn’t.

I’ve seen multiple neurologists over the years (no clear answers). Just saw an endocrinologist who felt rushed/dismissive and only ordered A1c, TSH, Free T4 and suggested small frequent meals.

I’m trying to figure out what kind of specialist or condition could explain exercise/heat-triggered hypoglycemia + migraines + post-exertion crash. Any similar experiences or ideas appreciated. I want to get back to running outdoors again 😅",1767834207.0,1,4,migraine,mental_physical

For reference, I've had migraine with aura since adolescence with relatively mild symptoms but that brain fog is a killer. Main trigger is light.

1q6istu,Persistent visual symptoms after days of frequent migraine auras — looking for similar experiences,"Hi everyone. I’m posting because I’m getting pretty worried and I’d really appreciate hearing from anyone who has gone through something similar.

Background:
I’ve had migraine with aura for almost 20 years (since my teens). My “usual” aura has always been the classic kind — visual changes that come on, last a limited time, and then resolve. Over the years it was unpleasant but predictable, and I learned how to live with it.

What changed recently:
About 10 days ago, something different started happening. In a single day I had multiple aura episodes (several in the same day), which is very unusual for me. After that, in the following days, I began having aura almost daily.

Then the persistent visual symptoms started:
Around 2–3 days after the daily auras began, my vision started to feel “off” in a way I’ve never experienced before. I want to be clear: I can see, and I can still function, but my vision feels blurrier and it’s harder to focus, especially when I try to read or concentrate on screens.

It’s not like a single blind spot or complete vision loss. It’s more like:
	•	a “hazy / blurry” quality that comes and goes,
	•	difficulty focusing (especially with reading),
	•	and a bright/shimmering sensation in my vision at times.

The most alarming part is that if I push my eyes too much (reading for too long, screens for too long, bright lights), I get the strong feeling that an aura is about to start again, like my brain is right on the edge of triggering one.

Medical work-up:
Because this scared me, I got evaluated and had tests done, including a brain MRI, and everything came back normal. That’s reassuring, but the visual symptoms are still here, and they’re very anxiety-provoking.

Where I’m at now:
I’m trying to find a balance between not avoiding screens/reading completely (because I have to work) but also not “forcing” it to the point where symptoms flare up. The uncertainty is what’s messing with me: I keep thinking, how long can this last? Is this still migraine-related? Does it usually improve?

My questions for the community:
	1.	Has anyone had a period where they suddenly had many auras / daily auras and then developed persistent visual symptoms (blur, difficulty focusing, light sensitivity)?
	2.	If yes, how long did it last for you (days, weeks, longer)?
	3.	Did anything help you recover faster (rest, gradual exposure to screens, preventive meds, magnesium, etc.)?
	4.	Did your symptoms eventually return to baseline?

I know this is not medical advice, but I’m hoping to hear real experiences from people who understand what “migraine visual stuff” can feel like. Thanks in advance for reading and for any insight you can share.",1767800726.0,2,2,migraine,mental_physical

1q6725b,Invisible illness strikes again,"Context: I am the sole provider for my family. I fainted over a year ago, was diagnosed with a concussion, and I've been on long term disability (partial) ever since. I deal with chronic migraines and POTS that got much worse after fainting. I was being treated at a clinic that was very supportive and recognized that each time I tried to increase my hours to full time, my migraines and POTS got worse and intollerable, so they were saying lets get those under control before going to full time. 

Unfortunately I had to change doctors. Today my new post concussion doctor said since I am not struggling with as much brain fog and memory issues I can go back to work full time with no restrictions. I pushed back saying I am still dealing with hours and hours of migraine pain every week and fatigue from my elevated heart rate, all of which are worsened by mental activity. She basically told me that the meds she recommends would fix that (but I've tried them before and they didn't fix everything. The one new med is just a different version of the old med. I don't know where her confidence comes from). I told her in the past that increasing hours just made things worse and things are NOT good even at reduced hours. I felt brushed off. It felt like since she couldn't SEE that I'm miserable 50-70% of the time so it must not be real.

She gave me my return to work paperwork and I left. 
I have a plan to contact her and her team and express how my symptoms are already borderline intolerable even with reduced hours. I understand that she must not be the right doctor to manage my partial long term disability since I'm not dealing with as many typical post concussion symptoms anymore (for example I can feel my hands and face again 🙌) so I will see if my neurologist can take over my care and paperwork (Unfortunately she has seemed hesitant to do so in the past).

I'm tired of having to choose between functioning at work, and living life outside of work. If I give work too much mental exertion or work all the hours, I suffer after and I can't participate in my kids lives or any activities that bring my small life joy.

1q5yhaw,Support needed,"Hi guys,

My husband (primary caregiver, bc I’m fully disabled with 3 chronic nerve conditions), is going for a job interview. I encouraged him to check out the opportunity and said we would discuss it if anything came of it. 

This job would entail moving 1.5k miles, away from my established drs. It would require us moving in with the in-laws bc housing is less affordable there, it would then mean that I lose my ability to have peace and quiet when my conditions are all raging. I would most likely lose my ability to drive since it’s going from rural to busy and I’m not sure I could do that. We would give up the place I just got set up and functional.  Currently if I cannot take myself my mother or husband take me to appointments, and I have them sit in with me bc I have severe brain fog most of the time. I have lived in the area of this job before and got quite sick where I had to be on an extra 16 medications for breath. 

My husband would have increased travel time, and thus depending on hours could be around me less 

We would gain a yard for the dogs and possibly more help from the family members for going to drs appointments. A future with more career opportunities for advancement, and income.

He feels that I’m too codependent on him, and that me stating my needs for the least amount of suffering possible is being narrow minded as this future in his eyes holds so much more possible positives. 

On a side note last night I just got told that my dad (still with my mom) is having some health scares. He is elderly and has been a strong man who doesn’t complain or notice any issue with his own body until it’s too late. 

Overall, I’m looking for support/help/commiseration.

I also injured my neck as a child. After I had my first son I had terrible migraines I went to a neurologist and she put me on topamax and then zomisamide. I also asked for medication that wouldn’t make me gain weight. I was actively trying to lose my baby weight and that was important to me. (Yes I know how it sounds but I just don’t want to gain unnecessary weight from a medication both of my parents are overweight and it runs in my family and I’m not trying to add another health issue) Before having my second son I had to stop the zonisamide to have him and I have been just living with it for about 8 years. I know there is probably something better for neck pain migraines but I did an online headache clinic where I asked if I could try zonisamide again and she was like um no, here is Amitriptyline and the side effect is of course weight gain. I just can’t do it. That and a muscle relaxer that causes me to be drowsey in the AM when I have to drive my kids to school. No thanks. Anyway long long story just to ask is there anything better for migraine and neck pain?? It’s really two separate issues that like to combine to create many headache days. Zonisamide worked great for me and I didn’t have much side effects. She told me today she would give me 25 mg. I was taking 300 before.

1q5vd52,Migraines as soon as I start living 'healthier',"Hi all,

Maybe a weird question, but as soon as I start to live 'healthier' (no or just a few little snacks, working out more, but still not anything too different or extreme I think), I instantly get migraines for days. 

I think this December (eating more sweets, working out less) I had about minor ones, which is major. Sometimes just 50mg sumatriptan is enough to kill it.

Now I've started living a bit healthier again, and having a major migraine that doesn't go away, whatever I do. (Also I have about 15 a month when doing this) 

I can just start snacking and stop working out again, but I alsooo want to be fit. 

Does anyone have the same? And any tips? 🙂

Btw I also take Qulipta",1767734251.0,63,72,migraine,mental_physical
1q5uzz6,Chronic Migraine and long term Amitriptyline use,"Hi everyone, I’m (34M) just posting to see if anyone is suffering in a similar way to myself and the long term treatment 

Growing up I pretty much always suffered from migraines but they were relative infrequent - maybe once/twice a year. Often occurring after I over exerted myself in a football/sports match. 

It was always a visual aura followed by throbbing headache which I would sleep off for a day and then had a migraine hangover for a couple of days after. 

Last year during a stressful time in work I woke up to a migraine headache in the morning. I just treated with nurofen and continued on my day thinking it’s just from work. 

However the following months after this migraine  I couldn’t get past the migraine hangover state - regular sensitivity to light, dull headache, general exhaustion, pretty low mood. Normally a few good nights sleep and I’d be well over my migraine. I did note in this phase I was regularly not sleeping well and having stressful/vivid dreams. 

Eventually when I couldn’t shake the migraine hangover phase I went to the doctor and was prescribed Amitriptyline 25mg which worked quite well for me. 

I wouldn’t say I was back to the old me but I was close. 

After a few months I even reduced to half a pill each night and this continued to work well for me. 

I’ve since tried to switch to doing a half dose every second night and am really struggling again. The days with no medication I wake up with the recurring dull headache that usual deteriorates throughout the day. Today I felt I even had a vestibular migraine and felt I had mild vertigo. 

I had MRI scans, which were fine, and also visited a neurologist - but the neurologist just told me it’s great I’ve medication that works and to just wean off over time and go back on if I relapse. I felt I was in and out of there all a bit quick and my wallet 400 euro lighter!! 

I just wanted to see has anyone had a similar experience where amitriptyline was a big help for dealing with chronic migraine and if they have just continued to take it over the long term? 

Like everyone on this sub I’m also keen to hear from anyone who has had a similar migraine experience and what might have worked for them!!! Thks for reading!",1767733454.0,0,11,migraine,mental_physical

SO I got hit with sudden daily migraines out of nowhere around October of last year. Before that I was really active - hiking multiple times a week, usually one 10+ mile hike a week. When I wasn’t hiking I loved the gym. I’ve got through phases of other activities, particularly yoga and climbing.

  
I am now improving with the help of Qulipta and wanting to become active again and the two things I‘ve (kind of stupidly) tried both really seemed to trigger migraine - hiking and heavy lifting.

  
My neurologist mentioned certain kinds of activities were particularly triggering. Pushups and overhead press, and heavy duty core exercise. She also nixed intense hiking which sucks as I had a plan to climb a specific mountain this summer but oh well, goodbye dreams. 

  
For those who manage to be active I’d love to talk specifics about what it is you do and what it is you avoid. I’ve read past posts on here and seen a lot about the importance of both electrolytes and hydration, as well as eating enough and at the right time. I’d love to hear anything else that’s made a difference for folks - certain warmups, or activities, or what. I miss exercise so much I am going crazy and I’m fucking angry I can’t climb this mountain I had PLANS DAMN IT.

I tried once by going cold turkey but that was a bad idea so spaced it out this time, I reduced to one a day and then every other day for 3 weeks. I’m now on like one a day before I fully taper out. I did noticed that by taking a lot of hormonal tea and magnesium I didn’t get any side effects. I’ve also been mindful to avoid too much sugar so that I don’t trigger a migraine and taking electrolytes.. I also read that an ergonomic pillow can help so invested in one of those and have also noticed it helped. I feel pretty good and am glad I’ve tapered off; if they work for you then great but I felt that along with my period i was really struggling with memory/focus. the challenge now will be to not get severe migraines again but I'm focusing on preventative: staying hydrated, sleeping more, 3l of water, hormonal tea, only dark chocolate, and a ergonomic pillow.

First, me (M53) suffering off and on for about 20 years. Not regularly consistent, but have pretty severe occurrences between 3-6x yearly. Sometimes they can be triggered by red wine or margaritas, other times there doesn't seem to be any known trigger. When I do get them it's always the same pattern of a severe headache with light and sound sensitivity, nausea, and brain fog after.

The body temp pattern I'm referring to is typically waking up in the middle of the night and being very hot. Hot to the point I need to remove any covers. I will start sweating profusely out of the blue, even in the dead of winter. I usually have to sit up as laying down makes the nausea worse. Often the nausea leads to violent vomiting. Over time I noticed that after sitting up if I put an ice pack on the back of my neck and top of my head I can reduce or eliminate the headache, which seems to be the start of the whole episode. Basically this seems to bypass most of the pattern completely. 

My wife even knows the routine now and is able to assist with this process, which is great. Before that it would be a long night dealing with the headache, then the whole next day to recuperate, often calling off work due to the brain fod hangover.

1q5b13t,Finally relief from chronic refractory migraines,"Turns out it was a combo of MCAS, dysautonomia, and hEDS. Started treating it from a histamine/mast cell standpoint and also an electrolyte/hydration standpoint.

My neuro was shocked when she saw me today at how much calmer all of my muscles were, BP and HR were normal for the first time ever and nobody had ever told me they were an issue, and she truly believes this is the longest stretch they’ve been pretty calm for since she started seeing me in 2021, now nearly 5 years ago.

TriOral is what I’m using for the electrolytes. Tastes sad but hot damn is it effective. Mix with 1L of water. It’s a World Health Organization rehydration supplement.

For the MCAS I’m doing different antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers.

The change is night and day.

So so so so so many things are better! Even the itchy ear canals from my hearing aids…totally normalized it seems!

Like wow. It is out of this world the changes we’re seeing from now being better informed and therefore trying very different approaches.

I was in the referral process for surgery and fighting for that to make it to the other hospital network. My neuro entirely believed it was necessary with how unresponsive I was.

Now it’s time to discuss with her lowering the number of migraine supplements and preventatives since it is completely insane everything I’m on.

I’m talking Botox, emgality, gabapentin, memantine, lamictal, omega 3, CoQ10, magnesium, riboflavin, butterbur, feverfew, and I bet I’m forgetting some.

The acute meds…I have to keep them all in a shopping bag there are so many pill bottles.

It’s remarkable, truly, that I can drink a few mouthfuls of electrolytes and wait a few minutes and I won’t need any sort of rescue meds even if I start getting worried. It’s that simple now.

So I’m not saying that would work for everyone, but it did make my migraines so impossible everyone agreed I needed a neuromodulator like a pacemaker for my brain, and after that I’d be on disability for the rest of my life. And now I don’t even really need acute meds hardly at all.

Keep fighting the good fight. Keep trying the funky things. And consider something like trioral if you’re like me who heavily relied on the McMigraine diet at times. Now the trioral gets me the sodium, potassium, and touch of glucose in the proper concentrations and it’s night and day when it comes to calorie count between those two options. Not all electrolytes are created equally. That’s a no-fuss, no-frills one designed for third world countries and has a highly researched recipe.

Very few side effects, unless i take two pills (10mg) then i get a bit loopy and confused.

I have a kidney infection, was in the ER today and took 4mg zofran, two doses of the antibiotic i was prescribed (keflex) and my regular dose of 50mg zoloft. Also took 1000mg acetaminophen for the pain.

Got a migraine around 7pm. Didnt want to take my triptan on top of all the other meds but it was getting really bad and i couldnt take ibuprofen due to the kidney infection. Eventually just took it and it worked. Around 9:30pm, i started getting this insane pain in my ribs, all the way around my chest. It felt kind of like really bad gas pains but it was REALLY bad. It came in waves and was just incredibly painful and scary. Did some research and apparently chest pain/tightness isnt that uncommon with triptans.

Now im left with the feeling of a hard ball in my throat, like i’m going to gag, but I don’t. It’s really uncomfortable but nothing compared to that chest pain. I was about to go back to the ER tbh.

Anyways, just curious if anyone has experienced that before? And why it might have happened to me for the first time after taking rizatriptan for years. Im assuming between the extra meds im on and the fucked up stressful day, but still what the hell?

UPDATE: The reason I didn’t immediately go to the ER is that the pain didn’t indicate anything cardiac related. It changed and lessened when I moved, which cardiac related pain would not. It also moved from side to side, hurting on the left, then on the right, then in my collarbone, etc. I also didn’t have shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, or any other symptoms.

1q54juc,My Ajovy Experience,"Hi all. Ajovy has transformed my quality of life…I want to share my personal experience in the hope that it can help others here.

I’ve had chronic migraine with aura since I hit puberty & have been on too many medications to count. Preventatives have never worked for me and I’d basically given up on them. The only med that’s ever helped is abortive Nurtec if I take it as soon as I notice prodrome. My migraines occurred pretty much every other day & they made it so difficult to be a self-sufficient adult. 

I started Ajovy seven months ago as a last resort. I’ve always hated needles but everyone’s advice here made it feasible. At first the change was minimal, but it kept compounding month to month. Now, I only have ~5 migraines a month. Not only has the frequency decreased, but the severity has decreased enough that if I take an abortive Nurtec & an Advil, those few remaining migraines will dissipate within 30 minutes. I haven’t had a “true” migraine in over a month. Before this, I literally couldn’t remember what it was like to not wake up expecting pain.

This is just my personal experience, but I hope this helps others pursue further treatment & not resign themselves to the pain. It’s amazing how much more time I have in my life. My relationships & work have improved because I can be more reliable, my sleep is better because I’m not lying awake clutching my head, and I don’t have to organize my entire life around my migraine triggers. I cannot overstate how grateful I am that I gave Ajovy a shot (hehe).",1767662358.0,17,8,migraine,mental_physical
1q53unk,Tracker app that tracks migraines and triggers,"There are a lot of migraine tracker apps out there and I’m curious if you know of any that can track the following:

- food
- weather
- sleep
- other suspected symptoms
- hormones/cycle patterns
- work days/non-work days
- or any suspected trigger that I want to eliminate as a trigger

I’m hoping for an app that I can input specific foods or things that I suspect are causing migraines, and days that I am migraine free or experiencing a migraine, and then the app can identify which things occur most often at the same time or leading up to migraines.

I’m starting to suspect my migraines are not only triggered by hormones but also my diet, and a few other things too. I ate healthy for 3 months (minimizing junk and sugar) leading up to Christmas and the frequency of my migraines seemed to decrease. Since the Christmas break though I’ve not been eating as good and have had a migraine every day.

Pre-menopause I only got aura symptoms (quite severe, sometimes - hemiplegic, etc) - but I could go years without any symptoms at all - and I never got head pain or nausea. Once my period stopped, I got the head pain and nausea, and its everyday - mostly low level, so I can function, but my life has changed a lot as a result! I am also, now, a walking barometer, and pressure changes can lead to bad migraine days.  I have not had aura symptoms for years - so, a bonus??

1q4rism,pain behind the eyes,"Hi everyone,
I’m trying to understand whether my symptoms line up with migraine or something overlapping, and wanted to hear if others have had a similar experience.

I’ve had persistent pain behind the eyes and forehead for about 1.5 years. Initially, an ophthalmologist thought it was dry eye and steroid eye drops helped temporarily, but the pain returned after stopping them. I was later diagnosed with MGD, but despite treatment, the pain never fully resolved.

Over time, the pain spread to the areas around my ears and the base of my skull. A dry eye specialist I saw later felt my eye dryness was only mild–moderate and suggested the pain might be neurological rather than ocular.

Neurology opinions have varied:
	•	One neurologist felt it was a tension-type headache (tizanidine didn’t help).
	•	Another neurologist said it could be chronic migraine with a cervicogenic component.

The pain is not throbbing or pulsating — it’s a constant dull ache that fluctuates in intensity. I’ve noticed some relief with:
	•	neck stretches (especially extension)
	•	upper back/shoulder massage
	•	yoga and breathing exercises
	•	pressure at the base of the skull

I do have a past history of migraine (around 8 years ago), though those were more head-based and not centered behind the eyes. I also have had poor, slightly hunched posture for several years, which may be contributing.

I’ve recently started amitriptyline (10 mg) and have been advised to do static neck exercises. MRI brain and orbit imaging has been ordered.

I’m not looking for a diagnosis — just wondering:
	•	Has anyone with migraine experienced constant eye/forehead pain like this?
	•	Or migraine mixed with neck/postural issues?

1q4rdmr,Terrified of starting Aimovig,"Hey everyone, I think this is my first time posting in here. 37F, I've had chronic migraines since pre-2019. They progressively have gotten worse, where now I have at least 3 a week, and that is a good week.

I've bounced around with insurance/no insurance for several years due to the military and separating from being in service. I now have coverage and just had my first neuro visit on 12/17. I've tried some triptans in the past, but because I am so sensitive to prescription meds, I haven't been able to stay on anything long-term. I either get none of the intended effects and a host of negative side effects, or nothing at all. Nothing over the counter helps either. Fiorcet has been the only as-needed meds I've kept, and even with that, it barely does anything. (For context, I don't even feel anything from a Percocet...)

New neuro doc put me on a new triptan for as-needed (Rizatriptan 10mg) and Aimovig 70 mg/ml. I'm going to be honest, I'm terrified of starting an injectable. I'm not nervous about injecting myself but the idea that I can't stop taking it if I have a reaction or bad side effects, like I can if I was taking a pill.

I have a laundry list of diagnosed chronic conditions, as well as ones that I'm in the process of testing for. EDS and Lupus are suspected, and the neuro says I'm suggestive of a neuromuscular disorder and wants to investigate MS and Myasthenia Gravis.

I'd like to hear as many experiences with Aimovig, the good and the bad. I've looked it up on this sub but what shows up seems to be pretty old.

Diagnosed: Endometriosis, Pernicious Anemia, mild gastritis, low-lying cerebral tonsils (need new MRI because it's probably gotten longer) DDD in neck and lumbar, sacroiliitis, stenosis and narrowing in lumbar, neuropathy, AV block, mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation, POTS, low complement C4, dependent atelectasis, Raynaud's, hypertension.

1q4nnt2,My non-medication hacks for getting relief,"I'm suffering from the most stubborn hormonal migraines at the moment. I always get a reoccurrence after my first dose of meds and then they don't completely respond to subsequent doses. But lately I've identified some random non-med things that help me during episodes, so I thought I'd share them here just in case they could help someone else (although they're nothing new). Please feel free to share yours. 

Most of these things involve disrupting pain signals through counter-stimulation, or simply confusing the brain into a different state.

**Hot bath with ice pack on head** 

Sitting in the bath with a bag of frozen peas over my head/eye area has surprisingly reduced pain for me before. It feels very weird, but the extremes of temperature shifts something in my brain - maybe because it is so unexpected and confusing. I'm not sure if it's a counter-stimulation thing or if it's to do with blood vessels! Maybe both.

**Trying to feel your hand with your leg** 

This is the only sensory mindfulness technique that has ever worked for my anxiety, and it has also helped reduce my head discomfort/mild pain. You touch a part of your body with your hand, but instead of feeling that part with your hand, you try to feel your hand with the body part. So if you touched your leg with your hand, you would try to feel your hand with your leg. It is great at redirecting your attention and surprising the brain into a different mode of perception.

**Massaging opposite side of head** 

Sometimes when my head is very tender before or after a migraine, I feel worried about getting a headache and compulsively rub around my temples and eye bone, which can  trigger a headache. So when I feel the urge to do this now, I try to massage the side of my head that *doesn't* hurt. I think this plays a little trick on the brain, lowering the volume of pain on the affected side, because it thinks there's something going on with the opposite side.

**The eyebrow hair clip trick**

You might have seen that reel/tik tok of the girl with tiny claw clips attached to her eye brow. I honestly believe everyone needs to try this at least once for mild-moderate pain relief, it has worked so well for me that my eyebrows are currently bruised from having clips attached to them. I think it must be some form of acupressure. It has made some of my milder headaches disappear completely and works really well for reducing moderate pain around the eye area. I basically just attach two mini claw clips to my brow and reposition them frequently. The sensation of pressure and skin-pulling counteracts pain signals. Sometimes I put clips on both eyebrows to balance out the sensation which can also reduce pain on the affected side, because after a while the brain forgets which is the 'migraine' side. 

**Ice pack on chest** 

Holding something very cold to my chest, over the breast bone, has made my head feel much clearer and made me feel less nauseous. I think this has something to do with the vagus nerve. In any case it really calms you down if you're feeling anxious, sick or faint. Sometimes it has temporarily made my attacks feel less intense. Good to do while lying down with an ice pack on your head/back of neck as well. 

  
Feel free to add!!! I am always searching for new ideas.

1q4hw08,Visual Aura and Magnesium (My Experience),"Visual Aura and Magnesium (My experience)

Hi all,

Thought I’d share my experience of getting rid of migraines and visual aura (that would result in a migraine as well).

To start off, I’ve (30M) always had migraines but earlier this year they got much much worse, and I had no idea why.

My vitamin D levels generally run low, so I had started taking about 4,000 IU of Vitamin D daily. 2 weeks of doing this later I got hit with my first visual aura (I’ve had migraines before but never had a visual aura), which at first really freaked me out. I continued having my vitamin D supplements and had panadol for my migraines, which wasn’t really helping. I had aura issues for a week straight, after which I went to a neurologist, who mentioned that auras are common in people with migraine issues, and put me on a steroid for 3 days (Dexamesthone) and then Zomig (Zomitriptan) post-steroid.

The medications did help, but what I had stopped taking after the neurologist visit was the Vitamin D. For the next 7 months, I had no aura episode, still had headaches and minor migraines from time to time, but no aura!

About a month a half ago, I decided to resume my Vitamin D supplements once again, and the next day my aura came back, which was devastating. So, I decided to look into it and found out that Vitamin D supplements deplete the magnesium levels in your body, which in turn can increase visual auras and migraines. I also saw some reddit posts mentioning migraine as their savior after decades of living with severe migraines.

After doing some research, I got myself some Magnesium Glycinate supplements (400 MG), which I take every single night before bed. This has absolutely changed my life as my migraines have pretty much disappeared, I’ve probably had 1 minor episode of a migraine since starting magnesium. I sleep better, I wake up feeling better, even on nights with terrible sleep which would usually cause me to have headaches/migraines, I do not wake up with a headache or migraine anymore!!

Never had one that involves any kind of aura or vision change until today, and I am desperately hoping it doesn’t happen again!

It ended up turning into like… a weird blurry bright zigzagging pattern at which point I realised way too late, a migraine was coming.
As soon as those patterns disappeared and I could actually see again, the pain started and all I could do was lay in the dark, frozen veggies to my forehead, and cry to my partner about how much pain I’m in.

That was until the UK has recently had a shortage in multiple dosages of Propranolol MR.

Whilst I haven’t had any migraines in the 7 days of completely cold-turkey (I was rationing, every other day doses before to stretch- which obviously is NOT recommended), I have definitely noticed an increase in headaches and unexplainable anxiety.

I tend to get atypical migraines in that my symptoms are not always the same and like to switch sides of my head/locations. sometimes the symptoms change so much I start gaslighting myself and thinking maybe they aren’t even migraines and there’s something else wrong with me.

Recently ive had some days where I get pressure in my forehead and then feel like the muscles in my head are contracting (although it’s not visible) and getting tight, especially with head movement. It will feel like tension between my temples and around my eyes/forehead. If I lie down it improves slightly but definitely affected by head position. my neurologist was saying any type of head pain can be consistent with migraines , not just headache. 

does anyone else get this symptom with their migraines?

the only other explanation I could think of is maybe my head muscles are starting to function/pull again since my Botox is wearing off and I’m overdue (dang insurance). Has anyone experienced any head muscle tension if they are overdue?

The only safe food at the moment seems to be carrots and he can’t live off carrots in the long term. Even rice cakes, which were getting him through the day, seem to be a trigger now. Lying down makes things worse as well. He is keeping a food diary and tracking other triggers. Screens seem to be a trigger. Being outdoors and/or doing exercise seems to help.

I have had migraines for about 15 years (I’m 30 now) so I know the deal with how unpredictable they can be. But this one I’m having now is concerning me and I would love some advice on if its worth going to a doctor and getting checked out. I've been in pain for 5 days now but the pain has come and gone over that time. Definitely getting worse at night. It started out like my normal migraines but only on my left side. And then 2 days into it, it turned into this very localized burning pain that felt like a hot metal rod going in through the base of my skull and out through my eyebrow. That pain has now persisted (but varied in intensity) for the last 3 days. And last night it got so bad I couldn't sleep at all. Usually my migraines are at most 72 hours and the pain is less localized (all over my neck or all over my head). With this one I feel like I can press on the exact point where the pain is coming from and where it is staying. I'm also experiencing some nausea and dizziness (but of course these aren't atypical). 

Of course my main concerns (like many of you I'm sure) are stroke or aneurysm. I know if I had a ruptured aneurysm the pain would be much worse but I’m worried this pain is a warning sign that there is a leak etc. Just because its so different from my normal episodes. Does anyone have any experience with this type of pain? And any advice for how to seek medical attention for it (which type of doctor to go to? ER? Urgent Care? GP? Neurologist?)

1q3wfkr,An expression of gratitude for everyone here,"I used to feel so alone and isolated. My plans were always being ruined. I was always in great pain. I was always “dramatic” about my “headaches”. I was always exhausted from fighting through migraines day after day, just to come home, vomit, sometimes cry, and cling to the toilet \*praying\* it would go away and mentally apologizing for any wrongdoings I’d committed that day, even if I couldn’t think of any. It felt like \*punishment\* and my incessant pleading an attempt to bargain.

I felt like a freak or psychopath for fantasizing about the relief I’d undoubtedly feel if I cracked my head open or even gouged my eyes out. Like I was the only one who would do anything, no matter how weird, to ease the pain, like pressing my head into the headboard or against the wall, or digging my nails into my arm or scalp to try to distract myself and focus on something else for a minute.

I would be blamed for migraines, I kept being given advice that just never worked (“dRiNk MoRe wAtEr”), and seeking actual treatment for “headaches” felt like I was just complaining to my neurologist. Logically I knew the pain was debilitating and controlling my life and therefore something had to be done, but nobody else ever had to be drugged for “headaches” beyond a useless ibuprofen. Seemed like everyone else just had their crap together and I was drowning in pain and exhaustion no one understood and more often than not dismissed.

Then I googled something about migraines (YES and I’m sorry, I know it’s the worst thing you can do) and found this subreddit. Whether it was you guys commenting on someone else’s post or replying to my comments, I realized exactly how many people had to go through the same things. It was because of this subreddit—and you guys even though you didn’t know it—that I‘m currently on a preventative that works and lets me function like an actual human. You guys kept encouraging each other to seek treatment and never quit or lose hope. You were all so supportive of complete strangers. You would give advice that I wouldn’t have ever thought of. I wouldn’t have known to bring up CGRP inhibitors to my neuro without people hear talking about it and sharing their stories. 

I‘m not alone and I’ve benefitted so much just be being here with everyone, and I now pass on advice and testimonies for people confused about their next steps too. I don’t know why exactly my mind went here this morning, but for once I just want to say thank you for helping me so much. You didn’t know it, but after years and years of near daily migraines wearing me down, after job losses and dismissive behavior from peers, I would not have had the strength or motivation to continue seeking treatment to get to this point.

1q3uzoe,imipramine and qlipta for migraine treatment,"hey yall i wanted to see if anyone else has gotten prescribed imipramine to treat their migraines. ive suffered for 10ish years with migraines and have pretty much tried everything under the sun with little to temporary to no help. 

i regularly see my neurologist who is also a headache specialist for migraine management but im just getting frustrated at this point. i’ve been seeing this specialist for a few years now and probably about 18 months ago she prescribed me imipramine to take daily to try and keep my migraines down. i think i started out at about 75mg daily for this medication and it worked pretty well for a while but then i slowly started getting brain zaps from this medication. they started happening in the hour or so leading up to needing to take my next dose but then slowly started happening earlier and earlier in the day. i now get brain zaps within about 14 hours of taking my dose. 

we’ve tried adjusting the imipramine several times at this point. we’ve increased my dose up to as high as 150mg and as low as 25mg (what im on now and am going to be slowly weening off). adjusting the medication did nothing to quell the brain zaps at all, increasing it made the zaps more aggressive if anything. my doctor has been extremely hesitant to take me off of this medication because it “kind of helps” sure i’m not having to call out as much from the migraines and headaches but i’m suffering almost constantly from brain zaps and i have a job where im constantly moving/turning. 

i recently started taking qlipta for my migrains management but oh boy are the side effects side effecting. the main issue that i have is the constipation i deal with on qlipta. i already have issues with constipation and this medication has just made it so much worse. i’ve tried talking to my neurologist about it but all she suggested was to take half a pill day and night rather than just one full pill at night. i know it’s not what you’re supposed to do, but i did ignore her to a certain degree and am just taking half a pill at night. i have a horrible time remembering to take meds (ive tried all the hacks) but can manage taking everything at night. 

i also got switched from sumatriptan as my emergency medication to naratriptan because i started getting a ”very strange” (neurologists words) side effect with the sumatriptan where i would slowly lose feeling in all of my limbs and to the point of not being able to feel anything. after 3 trips to the er due to this we stopped the sumatriptan. 

im just so tired of having to try new medications and nothing seeming to help. i hate feeling like garbage all day every day whether it be from a migraine, headache, or side effects.

also slight tmi but this mostly came around bc it’s currently Sunday and i don’t think ive pooped since Monday, even after having a severe upset stomach on Wednesday. i went and got coffee from a place i know makes me have to poop and taken laxatives but i’ve still got nothing happening besides that awful “full” feeling that comes with severe constipation.

1q3k77d,Post-COVID migraine sufferers: your diagnosis and treatments?,"So I’ve had chronic migraines 1-3 times a week since immediately after I had COVID September 2022 (so well over 3 years now. I’ve seen many posts of people sharing about post-COVID migraines but none with triggers/trends of effective managements shared. I’m just wondering if there’s any common themes for those of us with these covid migraines??

IF you’re a post-covid sufferer I would LOVE to hear any of the following: 

1️⃣any common triggers?
2️⃣effective preventative treatments? 
3️⃣effective acute treatmwnts 

➡️treatments ineffective? 
➡️any diagnosis or suspicions? 

I’ve struggled SO hard to find a medical provider that actually has expertise and advocates for me. So yes. Here I am asking reddit. 

For me personally my answers would be: 
1) drinking alcohol makes them worse (sometimes), eating lots of protein/salts seems to reduce migraine frequency (but I’ve never had a huge appetite so I find this challenging), regularly drinking electrolytes and tons of water helps reduce frequency. 
2) propranolol was effective as a preventative but I kept needing dosage increases (up to 100mg 2x day), and I was getting wild nightmares and reduced effectiveness,  so was recently switched to Venlafaxine 75mg which has been completely ineffective after 8 weeks and causing crazy night sweats. 

3) Mint-Frovotriptan has been my most effective acute treatment, along with frozen coffees, chugging electrolytes and having a nap. Other failed acute treatments: Cambria did nothing, Advil and Tylenol do nothing, rizatriptan was partially effective but not as good as frovotriptan. Other suggestions that don’t work for me beyond a couple minutes include all the classics: ice on the head, peppermint oil, feet in hot water, craniosacral therapy, pressure points on my head, acupuncture … have been willing to try absolutely anything 🙃. 

I’ve seen mention of covid causing POTS or Dysautonomia so looking into those more, I suspect that I need more hydration and more electrolytes than the average person (I drink 3-4 litres of water a day, if I’m exercising I can be slightly more or with electrolytes added).

I spent years without triptans in my tool belt and they would have made a world of difference. As well as the bajillion other stuff i’m on and do….. but triptans are probably least invasive and scary and def the most immediately helpful. Just like an Advil but if it actually worked ;-)

1q3iws4,Craziest thing I’ve done - pellet counting,"I’m doubling my dose of Effexor re what my doc suggested. When starting Effexor, my body felt weak and lethargic and almost “poisoned” for a full month before I started to feel normal. Same when I initially increased my dose. 

Now, years later, I am doubling again. I tried just taking the higher dose, but my body didn’t like that. Instead of withstand feeling sick, i’m taking about a month to slowly increase my dose. 

I counted how many pellets are in a pill and can estimate pellets / mg, and am using that info to slowly increase my dose by 10 mg every week until I reach the target dose. 

Has anyone else done this??? I know some of you will think i’m crazy lol, the people in my life certainly do, but it feels like a labor of love to count the individual pellets knowing i’m helping my body and saving it from unnecessary discomfort. 

I am sure this is more common and helpful when weaning off since Effexor has crazy withdrawal symptoms, but my body is sensitive when I start meds too 🤣",1767508883.0,9,11,migraine,mental_physical
1q3ihxz,Question: I have myself an exertion headache on the 31st and occasionally the same headache returns if I move my head too fast or exert a lot of energy at once.,"So after Xmas I decided the dumb decision to pull my family’s Xmas tree up the stairs by myself via using a leash to wrap around the box. I almost lost it at the top and had to exert a lot of effort to pull it up.

That’s when I felt a thunderclap of a headache just pang its way into my life and I was so startled by it and exhausted from exerting myself I sat down on my floor for 10mins and waited it out. It didn’t go away fully until late that night. 

I’ve now noticed that since then, it comes back to me if I exert a lot of energy at once, especially if I dip my head or something.

It’s always a straight line throbbing from temple to temple. It doesn’t spread but it makes my eyes sensitive to light and makes me nauseous.

Any advice?",1767507517.0,3,1,migraine,mental_physical
1q3gyty,Can sleeping too much cause migraine as well?,"**My Question :** I am giving a brief about my history and present situation with this pain. Can you please tell me if this is migraine pain? Also what can I do to manage this pain apart from taking meds?

**Background :** I have been having severe eye pain and headaches for many years now. Since i had really bad myopia i suspected it to be because of that since the pain mainly started from my eyes and then spread to the temple. But 3 years ago I had underwent a lasik surgery and got my glasses  removed. But contrary to my belief the pain stayed and happened occassionally.

**Present Situation :** Since i suspected the pain to be my poor eye health, i got a checkup done by my eye doctor. After inspection he said there is nothing wrong with your eye, the pain could be because of migraine.  
For a few months I have been trying to observe the patterns of when does this pain occur. I started seeing that whenever I **oversleep,** I get this pain in my eyes. (cannot say conclusively that it happens everytime, but a lot of time? Yes). Today I overslept and woke up with mild pain in my eyes. So could this pain be migraine?

**Description of the Pain :** The pain begins from the top and back of my eyes and then as the intensity increases it grows to the head and temple. Whenever I do anything that increases my heart rate, I feel immense throbbing pain throughout the affected region as if my veins are gonna pop with the increased blood flow. The ***intensity of the pain*** ranges from being very mild to very excruciating pain.",1767502742.0,18,14,migraine,mental_physical

Main differences were the serving size, amount of riboflavin and magnesium (the one I just got has double the amount, so the one with 400mg riboflavin), and the weird ""(AM & PM)"" part on the old bottle in the recommended use section.

1q3bxbx,I just don't want to take these medications,"I recently started having migraines with headache that last for days. Pain ranges from 2-7 scale. I've had a history of ocular migraines once every 2 years. I also have had episodes of decreased sensation in my face over the past 6 years. But the headaches have not started until recently. At first it just used to be one headache a month....but then it has recently progressed into intermittent pain that lasts nearly a week. 

My neurologist prescribed me rizatriptan. Reading the adverse events and potential side effects scared the crap out of me. I'm someone who struggles with nocturnal panic attacks and will often wake up with a racing heart. I also don't have anything officially diagnosed but from at home readings I struggle with blood pressure and poor circulation. 

My neurologist only initially helped me get 3 days of intermittent FMLA at my job. At first she would only grant me one day. When I told her that these episodes have been lasting longer and I need 5 days off of FMLA per month she prescribed me Nortriptyline. Then she also prescribed me sumatriptan and told me to take that with naproxen next time a headache comes on. 

That antidepressant is scary to me. People have reported suicidal ideation and increased hallucinations. I have a history of being suicidal. I don't like to talk about this with doctors....I don't like to bring up any mental health stuff with doctors because then they don't take me seriously and blame mental health. I already struggle with hympapompic hallucinations. I don't want to have more hallucinations

I live by myself. I don't have any family or friends nearby. I can't afford to have some really scary side effect happen to me. I can't afford to be suicidal or in psychosis. 

I haven't been taking any of these medications. I'm lucky that the pain isn't AGONIZING. But it has slowly been getting more prominent. Each episode has been worse than the last. I have been using ice, stretching, and the ocassional OTC medication. I'm keeping a diary of OTC medicines and thankfully I have been staying well below the threshold of medication overuse headache.

But it still sucks. It's still scary and miserable.

I'm considering trying the Cefaly device....the only thing that scares me about it is reading about tinnitus in the handbook. I have very very faint tinnitus in complete silence and I'm scared of making it worse. 

I just don't know how to talk to this neurologist.

I feel like shes' going to get pissed off at me. I feel like she's not going to take my fears seriously. And I feel like she is going to ""take back"" the 5 days of intermittent FMLA that she signed off on for my job. ",1767488728.0,0,28,migraine,mental_physical
1q3bkp7,Did my Botox stop working?,"WTF is going on, friends. 

I’m 3.5 years into taking Botox for migraines. 190 units quarterly. Prescribed by a neurologist/headache specialist at a major US university hospital 

Last month I got my usual Botox, though the Fellow administered not my usual neurologist. First two weeks were usual. Then one eye started to droop significantly and still is. A week later my face twitching returned, which happens when I’m crashy but stopped completely with Botox 3.5 years ago. Now with a migraine for a week and it’s just not clearing like it usually does with my strategies. 

I guess I’m asking does Botox stop working eventually? Is it just this round that didn’t land? Is my miracle fix spent?? 



CONTEXT 
I have had a perma migraine from a 2020 COVID infection. Also got MECFS + dysautonomia. 

Before this month, my migraines were maybe 2-3/month when I’m living beyond my baseline (ie live music, house party). For me this is a miracle and has been my baseline for 1.5 years. 

Currently on a preventive CGRP inhibitor (Aimovig for 1.5 years after Qulipta for awhile). Nurtec, zavegepant, and Naratriptan (menses only) as abortives. Loads of lifestyle changes to keep mostly headache free baseline. ",1767487805.0,10,9,migraine,mental_physical

Now I will say chronic migraines run in the family, so I didnt even think about the nexplanon. I did all the tests, countless doctor appointments, countless meds, nothing really stopped them. 

I got desperate and did some research about my birth control, seeing a lot of ppl talk about migraines/headaches. After calling so many clinics to find a good appointment,  I got it out and switched to the depo shot. I've only had 1 small headache since then.

I limit sugar and carbs as a part of regular migraine management. Some days are better and some worse. Also on Emgality. Have not had a really bad migraine in a few months, but I usually have some pain every day. 

I haven’t felt great over the past couple of weeks - but my chronic daily headache has stayed between a 1 and a 3 every day, so I’ve been pretty functional. Yesterday I had a bit of stress - some calls and deadlines while working from home, also my long-distance partner needing to drive back home after the holiday break together.

 I was feeling good, with almost no pain, and got careless and ate a bunch of things people had brought over - a few pieces of peanut brittle, a handful of candied popcorn, a couple of pignoli cookies. Also some leftover steak from a cousin’s dinner the night before, so it’s not like I ate only sugar.

I woke up at 5am to stabbing pain, started throwing up soon afterward. I was shaking and felt badly hung over (remembering what a horrible hangover feels like - migraines have kept me teetotaling for a decade now).  It was noon before it stopped. I took an odensatron and a Benadryl and slept. Still hurts, but feel less sick.

Anyway, I had to cancel a bunch of commitments today while feeling like death. Both hating myself for being so careless, but also hating that my reckless indulgent holiday behavior (ie a few sweets here and there) is NOT THAT CRAZY and would be TOTALLY NORMAL for a normal person.

Now that the fog of surgical pain is lifting and I am having my first migraine attack post surgery I’ve realized something terrible. 



I’m really concerned that taking Tylenol so regularly for the surgical pain will cause rebound headaches/migraines once I stop needing it. I’m not as concerned about the oxycodone because it’s prn and I’m only taking it when I really need it (at most two tablets a day, when I’m at a 8/10 or 9/10 pain)

I am 22 now, so they started when I was 19 and had progressively gotten worse. At the same time, I was having horribly painful periods and cramps all month long. The doctors suspect endometriosis, so recommended the mirena IUD, hoping it would help the endo and the migraines, since my migraines are so hormonal. I usually seem to get migraines with any hormonal shift. 
I have had the Mirena IUD for almost four months now. For the first month, I didn’t have many symptoms and actually my migraines felt a bit better. But now, for the last three weeks I have had an ongoing migraine everyday that is more intense than my usual ones. I’ve also been bleeding everyday for these three weeks and having horrible cramps and hot flashes and barely sleeping. I’ve lost a lot of weight from the nausea too, which I did not have much weight to lose. 
For anyone who has had experience with endo, IUDs, and/or migraines, did you have worsening symptoms before they got better? I am so unsure about whether to continue to wait this out for my body to adjust to the IUD or just have it taken out and handle the migraines and endo in a different way.

(Of course, because I had the typical symptoms of anxiety: partial vision loss, half my face going numb, vertigo, and things like that)

Already diagnosed and medicated, I once had a 14-day episode and went to my father's house so I wouldn't be alone. He assumed it was anxiety AGAIN. Like, The aura episode (not pain) was so strong that I spent 3 days in the emergency room going back and forth, with new medications, injections in my butt, under observation, and with a group of neurologists. Not a single doctor said it was anxiety! When I went to the family doctor, my father came in to tell him, ""she had an anxiety attack."" (You know, those typical 14-day anxiety attacks, with intense vertigo, very strong vibrations in the head, and electrical waves)

And even now, whenever a migraine aura lasts more than 5 seconds, they stare at me and say one of these things: 

1 > I think that's already your subconscious, huh... (Why was the exact symptom that led to my migraine aura diagnosis today, of all days, going to be my subconscious mind and not a migraine aura?!?!!!)

2 > Do you want diazépam? (Diazepam is for anxiety and muscle pain! I don't need to relax my muscles any more if I already don't feel them 😭)

When I went to the gym, I’d do stairmaster for 20-30 mins, incline for 10-15 mins and I’d do some weights. I’m not sure which caused me the migraines. Most of the time, I’d do cardio. I think that killed me off, but my head would pound a bit from weights. I’m not on any migraine medication nor have I been to the doctors about the migraines as they’re only triggered by my triggers.

1q2wi22,My inpatient experience at a pain clinic (Schmerzklinik Kiel),"Hey hi hello everyone,   
From the 10th of December to the 23rd of December I was a patient at pain clinic Kiel ([https://schmerzklinik.de/en/](https://schmerzklinik.de/en/)), and I figured I'd share about my experience and what I learned in case anyone else can benefit. I was told their website also has a lot of resources in English as well. Feel free to ask questions and I'll do my best to answer!

My name is Kat, I'm 31, I'm Danish but live in Germany, and I've had migraines since childhood. My earliest consistent memory of them is around 11 years old.   
Migraines run in my family but mine are a lot worse and I had a diagnosis of chronic migraines (and PCOS) before going. After many failed tries with preventatives, the most recent a combo of botox and ajovy, my neurologist suggested the pain clinic, which I was more than happy to apply for.   
You need 3 months of a daily headache/migraine calendar to be able to apply, and to fill out a bunch of other questionaires. Once approved you just wait. I got approved early October shortly after applying, and got a spot in December. Normally a stay is 16 days, mine was a bit shorter due to the holidays.

For me this was covered by insurance and I only paid 10 euros a day, which is the normal hospital fee in Germany. This is all inclusive with three meals a day and a two-person room with attached bathroom. If you have private insurance or are willing to pay, a single person room is possible. I was very lucky and got moved to a two-person room that I had to myself the entire stay, as my roomate was a very cold type and wanted the heating on full blast, and I'm very very heat-sensivite and a warm room is enough to trigger a migraine for me. She was super nice, we were just opposites temperature wise :) Rooms are super nice and clean, staff emptied trashcans and sweeped the floors almost daily, clean towels were provided twice a week.   
  
You get sorted into a group of patients with similar conditions to you, and you have a shared group activity schedule from about 8 am til 5 pm. on weekdays, weekends are generally off. These activities are voluntary and include both physical activity (nothing hardcore, but beneficial), relaxation/meditation, as well as seminars on anything from how to cope with pain to nutrition. I was personally told by my doctor that that entire group schedule was voluntary, but other people in my group were told the seminars were mandatory as well as progressive muscle relaxation classes. I don't know if it's just because I'm still learning German, or if it's because I've dealt with the condition for so long and had more base knowledge than many of the others, but my doctor consistently told me they were voluntary for me. Either way, if you're in too much pain to go, you are never forced.   
  
Every patient gets assigned a doctor and a psychologist. The doctor you meet with on the  day of arrival for a standard neurological exam + going through your history and current state etc. I was also given a Cefaly device to try out while at the clinic. After that the doctor visits you every weekday in the morning in your room to check in with you. Nurse staff is also available 24/7 and deliver your meds daily if you're put on any.   
Outside of the group schedule you are given a personal schedule, this one is mandatory (unless you're sick, then you cancel with the nurses), and consists of about 1-2 appointments a day. These are with your psychologist, physiotherapists, or biofeedback. My psychologist booked extra for me because I'm depressed lol. She also helped me so I can find a therapist at home to continue getting help.  
At the physiotherapist it's up to you to voice what you need, they mainly do massages, but if you want exercises you can get that too. I had massages as the exercises I could learn from the different group activities.   


When I arrived I was no longer on any preventatives, but used sumatriptan injections and OTC painkillers. They put me on a medication pause to get rid of any lasting medication overuse headace. I learned that painkillers combined with caffeine (like excedrin) are the worst offenders when it comes to MOH. I was also under the impression that the general 10 days a month rule for painkillers was per medication, and not per day where painkillers were used. So the general rule is don't go above 10 days of using painkillers (of any kind) a month. The medication break lasts 4 weeks, so I'm still on it, but I plan to keep it going for as long as possible. because the longer the better. They told me that MOH muddies the waters, and it becomes a lot harder to distinguish what type of headache/migraine you have, because the MOH doesn't respond to medication and can feel like a bit of everything.   
Being off painkillers they don't leave you helpless.   
I was given:  
\-  Vomex (dramamine) to handle any nausea and to relax me, which can give you a bit of distance from the pain, also makes you tired  
\- Melperon, an anti-psychotic, but works as a sedative to help you relax/sleep and also gives you distance from the pain

If those two (in their recommended doses) weren't enough, you could tell the nurses and get an infusion and/or injections in the neck/shoulders with prednisolon (I think, or another steroid)  
I ended up only needing it on my last day, so they gave me prednisolon pills instead since they couldn't observe me after I left. I had a great effect from those. The rest of the time during the stay I managed to sleep whenever the pain was too much with the help of the previously stated meds. I was also put on doxepin as a preventative and also to help me sleep as I struggle with poor sleep. Having good effect sleepwise I'm continuing the treatment with doxepin currently on a 50 mg dose a couple of hours before bed. It's too soon to tell if it has a preventative effect on the migraines. The effective dose is between 50 - 100 mg so I'll be adjusting my dosage with my neurologist from here on. If I turn out to have a good effect from it they recommend pausing it in 9 months time to see if I have a lasting effect, if not I can start it back up. 

The whole goal of the stay is to help you with treatment if possible, but mainly to give you tools on how to cope with the pain and better your situation on your own. For example I struggle a lot with feeling guilty over being sick, and can easily trigger a migraine because my body has a stress response to said guilt, so my psychologist gave me tools on how to help regulate that with the goal of teaching my body not to react so strongly. A lot of the pain management is teaching your body to relax and being forgiving to yourself. 

At the end of your stay you get a report to bring home to your neurologist (or whoever treats you), mine is seven pages long and include various diagnosis and a treatment plan, including other options if doxepin doesn't work, for my neurologist. 

My diagnosis were:  
\- G44.4 – Headache due to medication overuse - Headaches caused by taking painkillers too frequently. 

\- G43.8/3 – Chronic migraine -  Migraine occurring on 15 or more days per month. 

\- G43.0 – Migraine without aura - Migraine attacks without visual or sensory warning symptoms. 

\- G43.2 – Status migrainosus - A severe migraine attack lasting longer than 72 hours. 

\- G44.8 – Other specified headache syndromes - A general category for headaches that don’t fit neatly elsewhere. 

\- M62.8 – Myofascial pain syndrome - Muscle-related pain caused by trigger points and chronic tension. 

\- F55.2 – Use of analgesics (painkillers) - Regular use of pain medication (does not automatically mean addiction). 

\- F33.1 – Recurrent depressive disorder, currently moderate - Depression that comes back over time, currently at a moderate level. 

\- G47.0 – Chronic pain disorder - Long-term pain that has become a condition in its own right. 

\- Sleep onset and sleep maintenance disorders - Difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. 

\- E28.2 – Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) - A hormonal condition affecting the ovaries.

Once I'm off the medication break I can continue using my sumatriptan injections if I have good effect from them, but they also included other suggestions in the treatment plan. As I don't actually have any effect of OTC painkillers (they just became a comfort/habit/hope) I won't be using them again for headaches/migraines.   
They also suggested I have prednisolon as a backup medication for status migrainosus as they usually don't respond to any medication, including the sumatriptan, for me. 

Treatment wise I mostly learned that I need to rest more and that sleep is the best thing you can do for a migraine. I usually cannot sleep off a migraine, but I'm guessing because the Vomex/Melperon helps you relax, which in turn gives your nervous system more peace, sleeping has been more effective for me at the clinic and since then. When I first arrived I had a massive attack and slept 25 out of the first 48 hours. After that I had the lowest pain level I've had in many years for awhile. 

I also originally thought that I have both migraines and tension headaches, but it turns out I don't have tension headaches, at least very little, despite being very tense from all the migraines. They taught me how to distinguish between the two as a migraine will always get worse with activity and stimuli, meanwhile a tension headache ususally improves with activity. They said to put your head between your legs and shake it, if the pain gets worse and is pulsing, then it's a migraine. Normally a tension headache isn't one sided like a migraine, but they mentioned that many patients at the clinic reported one sided tension headaches, so they no longer used that as a distinction. And since I'm always light sensitive (which is one of my migraine symptoms) they theorized that my daily headache, which I assumed was tension, is most likely a lower level migraine (status migrainosus). However, if you have a medication overuse headache, telling them apart will be a lot more difficult. 

I voiced concern to my doctor that I wasn't able to participate much in the group activities and I was worried about missing out on learning, and she told me over and over that the most important thing I could do was learn to rest. 

On arrival they did a blood test and an EKG, they did another one of each a week later. We also logged out bloodpressure twice a day, and filled out an hour-by-hour pain calendar during the stay, where we noted medications, other treatments, pain strength, sleep etc. 

Overall it was a very pleasant stay depsite the reason for being there. Staff was super nice and understanding, the facilities were great and didn't feel like how you imagine a medical clinic would be. I don't know if I was just super lucky, but I was so happy with my doctor and my psychologist, and both were fluent in English so I didn't even struggle with a language barrier due to my poor German. 

Today I feel like my daily pain level is a bit lower, I still get attacks and still have a daily headahce, but that daily headache doesn't seem as severe or persistent, so I probably do have/had a medication overuse headache. Hopefully it will continue to improve with time. Some of the massages also managed to release some tension points which means less daily pain, though still a long way to go there. I also feel like my permanent light sensitivity has gotten a bit better. Considering all of it is connected, improving one thing is likely to help another :)

I'm sure I forgot stuff, but please feel free to ask if you have any questions and I'll answer if I can!

1q2tiql,UK - How/where can I find help that takes migraines seriously?,"Chronic sufferer from around age 10 (now 30), attacks usually come in bunches ie. If I'm lucky enough to have 10 days free, I'll probably average one a day/every other day for the following week or two. As you'll all know, it's beyond depressing. Has also cost me my last two jobs despite doctors notes etc. as I'll typically have to leave work a few times a month which has essentially made me unemployable despite my best efforts.

While varied, my attacks seem predominantly ocular, and in the last 1/2 years my photosensitivity has become so bad I wear FL shades almost around the clock, otherwise phone screens, the sun, any direct light can be an instant trigger - it's become essentially disabling. I pretty much don't watch movies, game, use digital screens minimally, people really don't understand how painful I find light to be and how much I have to avoid it.

 I'm writing this in tears after barely knocking my head today out the shower, and guess what... potential migraine incoming. Sleep, sugar, caffeine, light and movement seem to be my main triggers, though most things seem to affect it. 

I'm in the UK and every doctor I've seen has just tried to reinstate the same daily preventative meds, with next to no actual concern or interest for my individual circumstances. No preventative I've been given has worked and I'm loathe to take medications thrown at me by people who barely listen to my symptoms. I wish I could have a true discussion with a doctor who would listen and not just try and shuffle another pharmaceutical down my throat in their alloted 2 minutes of giving a damn. I have asked to be referred to specialists many times and as per my last NHS conversation, they apparently dont exist.

I'm not sure if my pain threshold is abnormally low, though my strongest attacks have lasted up to 4 days at which point I am essentially suicidal - I have never even been allowed pain relief by a doctor, not that I want to rely on it though migraines have almost taken my will to go on. I just don't understand where in the UK I can find help with this, I already hate doctors and feel completely failed by them. Have wanted to write a message like this for a long time but I'm an insular person and find this all very uncomfortable, but fuck it. I'm sick of suffering within my own shitty body.

Topamax worked wonderfully for it until I had to stop, but so did amitriptyline. None of the CGRPs have worked so far, and triptans seem to be hit or miss on whether they will work or not. I have daily pain now, so it's not like I can use them every time anyway. 

I wonder, because sometimes my back also hurts on the same side. And my neck. And my shoulder. And my jaw and my ear. What if I have tension headaches? Or what if it's referred pain and there's a very easy solution I'm not seeing? I decided early one that I couldn't keep thinking like that because it's exhausting, but sometimes the worry creeps back in.

I asked my neuro once if he was sure I had migraines, and he told me it didn't matter that much whether they were migraines or tension headaches, since treatment is similar for both. I guess that's somewhat reassuring. 

Maybe I just have imposter syndrome because I don't get the pounding pain nor the nausea.

1q2qs6b,Frustrated by newer cars,"For me, the prodrome and hangover phases of a migraine often come with extreme sensitivity to sound. Sometimes it lasts for days, even when there are no other significant symptoms. I find that even when I am not in any phase of an attack, I have a really visceral reaction to sudden loud sounds. I'm more sensitive during an attack, but in general I just really like to have a quiet environment all the time.

My current car is festooned with mandatory sensors and safety features that beep and chime and ding and bong at various volume levels, usually in response to a nonexistent problem.

Things my car has audibly warned me of that I don't care about:

- The door is open. I know. I opened it.
- The engine is on.
- The engine is off.
- It thinks I am not paying attention. You're an inanimate object, car, I don't care what you think. I am able to make safety/alertness decisions by myself.
- My dry or gloved hands do not provide the sensor in the steering wheel enough electric conductance (is this what it measures?) and it thinks I am not holding the wheel.
- The wireless phone charger pad is not working.
- The bag of dog food on the rear passenger seat is heavy enough that it thinks it's a person, and not seatbelted, and it bongs every 5 seconds until I pull off the highway (at the next exit - no shoulder in this country) and buckle up the nonexistent passenger.
- The car in front of me is moving and I have not yet begun to move.
- The car in front of my is slowing down and it doesn't think I have braked hard enough.
- The car is on but the lights are off (I know. I turned them off because I'm parked and don't want to blind people, but I can't turn the engine off because I need the climate control. Why do you have an off switch if you're going to freak out when I use it?).
- A windblown leaf has passed in front of the radar sensor while parking (this one is LOUD).
- The side assist radar (blind spot radar) is temporarily unavailable. This one usually happens in situation where there is an object (usually a filtering motorcycle) in the blindspot and it has confused the heuristics that power the blindspot monitoring. It's particularly frustrating because it's also quite loud, accompanied by a visual alert, and occurs precisely at a time when I cannot afford to be distracted (ie because there is a filtering motorcycle/baby carriage/wagon full of puppies in my blindspot).

Older cars were perhaps less safe, but I really miss the tranquility of driving without the dread that my car is going to assault my ears at some unexpected time. I have developed routines to cope with some of these (turning off as many of these features as possible each time I start the car, leaving the rear seat belts belted all the time, even when unoccupied) but they can't all be disabled and I am frustrated by the feeling that I paid a lot of money for something and I now have to develop coping mechanisms to work around mandated annoyances.

One of these days I might get a scan tool and start trying to disable things in the computer, or work up the nerve to tear my dash apart and remove the machine that goes ping.

I would pay good money for a safe, new, quiet car designed not to intrude on my senses. Like, that could be an actual selling feature of the car -- sensory sensitivity mode or something. I understand that driving requires all senses and alertness but there's enough going on with other road users and the external environment without the car itself contributing to the chaos.",1767433924.0,78,13,migraine,mental_physical
1q2ojln,Migraines with a visual aura,"Hey, so for context I haven't been diagnosed yet, but I am sitting in the ER waiting to be evaluated. 

Two years ago I had a visual aura. It was a rainbow oil spot that started small and then spread with a rainbow zig-zag outline. It lasted maybe five minutes, and then a headache came on. The headache was not horrible, as I took an aspirin during the aura because I was scared I was having a stroke. It never happened again, and I never went to the doctor because I live in America and insurance is just so fun.

Today, I had another visual migraine for the first time in two years. It happened just the same. It started as a small tiny static rainbow dot that grew to the shape of a large, rainbow, zig-zag ""c"" shape. It went across both fields of vision, and my peripherals were fuzzy, along with wierd splotchy effects similar to when you stare into a light for too long and then look away.

This is so scary to go through. The Internet told me once again to take an aspirin and go to the ER in case it's a stroke. So I listened this time and I'm here. My vision is fine, and I have a dull ache in the back of my head and directly behind one eye ball. I'm tired. Its 1AM and I've been waiting two hours.

I guess I'm looking for advice. Has anyone here had only a few visual auras spaced years apart? What do I do? Should I stay or just go home and try and make an appointment with my primary?

The fabric feels nice, the padding in the cap is soft but firm. If you do pull the cap over your eyes, it’s pretty good at blocking the light.

1q2mi0k,What prescription to ask for? And first time lingering aura.,"Hi, 21F and have had migraines with aura since I was 12. Usually they start with aura, which lasts about 40 minutes and is basically blinding, and then the intense pain and nausea/vomiting comes on. Usually feel less debilitated after about 4 hours, with a lingering headache the next day.

A little over 48 hours ago, an aura began, but didn't develop into a full fledged headache. That had never happened before. At the time I was grateful. Last night and today, though, so 24 hours later and on, I have a persistent slight aura in my left eye, and the pain came on today. I'm 99% sure the migraine came on from a drop in barometric pressure.

I'm going to the doctor in a couple days. Which prescriptions, either preventative or abortive, do people recommend I ask about? And has anyone experienced this undeveloped headache but lingering aura?

We’ve had them from this place before, and they were more like a fruit slushy. And, of course, I didn’t order the banana flavor. I thought the smoothie looked a little off in color, the taste was pretty much the fruit flavor I picked, however I stopped drinking it halfway through and said “something’s just not right, particularly with the texture”. 

New Year’s Day I woke up with a slamming headache—one of the worst I’ve ever had. (I don’t drink alcohol, primarily because of migraines, so wasn’t out partying it up on NY’s Eve.)

1q2dq1y,Fellow migraineur audiophiles / producers: headphone and other recommendations?,"I’m grateful for the life I have although there are certainly some cruel ironies, one of the largest of them being that I have a hobby/passion that can itself be a trigger, which is electronic music production. I’ve been in love with sampling and sequencing since I was a teenager and that love has evolved across genres, and the music I make and enjoy can be quite otherworldly and immersive, as is the experience of producing it. 

Needless to say, I spend much less time listening to and making music than I would like to because of migraines. Certain frequencies that are too low or too high, technical mistakes that make a jarring sound, bad EQ, feedback, clipping, and certain genres in general can not only be painful during an episode but can trigger one. And my own work, which has in large part been experimentation and trial and error, often causes me pain - especially if I’m working with headphones, and I often find that I need to in order to have the greatest control in terms of mixing.

I don’t know if noise canceling headphones themselves are always going to be a trap for me, or if there are brands/models out there more suited for people who suffer from migraines? I also wonder if it is the headband that does it, or the sound/volume or the constancy of it over many hours, the screen immersion, or all of the above. I’m trying to keep my practice more hands on by reincorporating a MIDI or MPC, but otherwise I’m hooked to the very machines that worsen my condition to create the music I love, and with my adhd hyper focus and extreme difficulty shifting gears, I cannot easily take breaks or deal with interruptions without being completely derailed. So I’ll spend hours in an Ableton hole, and 9 times out of 10 I come out of it with a migraine. Even so, I can’t let it go. I lead a very quiet homebody life because of my pain and though I also enjoy reading and writing my life severely lacks stimulation and music production is one of the few things that brings me that excitement, plus the connectivity of at least being able to share it with others. 

All that ramble being rambled, I guess I wanted to know if there are others in my predicament, and I was hoping that if indeed some of you are out there, perhaps you have headphone recommendations, or particular hacks or habits you have in place to accommodate for your migraines and mitigate the triggers?

1q2c0ek,Found Success with Low Dose Psilocybin — Should I disclose to my Neurologist?,"I have a disease similar to Ehlers Danlos that causes frequent migraines that last 24 - 48hrs at a time.  About 2 years ago my condition had worsened to experiencing a chronic daily headache in addition to migraines, I was now using my triptan almost daily for several months.

Knowing this was not sustainable I tried to get on Emgality but was denied by insurance, still needing some kind of treatment I desperately tried Psilocybin.  At first at I tried weekly micro-doses, first 100mg then 200 (no improvement) it wasn't until I reached 300mg that I was able to go a week without a migraine.

Over the next year and a half I settled at 500mg every 14 days for my personal optimal dosage, any higher yielded no additional migraine benefit and only acute psychedelic effects.  I went from refilling my triptan script early every month to having a single script last 5 - 6 months.  Best of all my chronic headache had completely stopped.

Fast forward to now 2 years in, I decided to take break as even though its a low dose it was starting to become fatiguing taking it every 2 weeks, I only made it about 3 weeks before all of my symptoms had returned and was up to 3 - 4 migraines a week along with my chronic headache returning.

I'm afraid to disclose this to my neurologist as psilocybin is a schedule 1 drug, I don't want to get labeled with substance use disorder and lose access to my anxiety or pain medication (if I needed it).

FYI I chart carefully, share this info with my doctor, and am mindful of MOH.).

So that doesn't seem great, BUT, on any day that I take Nurtec, I'm twice as likely to be pain-free for part of the day. And even though I do go on to develop a migraine at some point, whatever pain I do experience is maximum a 4/10.

  
Is this a success for Nurtec? Because if so, it seems kind of underwhelming, especially considering I have to pay out of pocket for my meds.

I've had migraines since I was a kid and usually just took advil and coffee (didn't always help, but usually did). I can't take advil anymore because my stomach won't tolerate it. I saw my doctor for an alternative, and she prescribed me zolmitriptan. I tried triptans once twenty years ago (imitrex) and it didn't help. I had a migraine start last night, but upon reading through the potential side effects, I got spooked and decided I'd hit this one with tylenol, though tylenol rarely helps. I've also been drinking coffee. I drink A LOT of coffee when I have migraines (and am a regular coffee drinker otherwise) and have noticed there's a point where I can feel the blood vessels in my brain constrict (usually after 6 - 8 cups), and it's a lovely feeling when I have a migraine. Instant relief (not fully, but enough to function).

So my question is, if I tried triptans 20 years ago and had no ill effect, and if caffeine tends to help most of my migraines now, should triptans be safe and work for me?

The only trigger I've identified:  Lack of sleep almost guarantees one or more episodes throughout the day. (Had one yesterday; expecting one today, too.  Cause: Book I'm reading is too good so I'm staying up too late, like an idiot). 

My symptoms are pretty classic.  I'm a reader, so most often I notice I'm having trouble seeing parts of words.  Small greyish/blind spot in near-central vision of one eye (not always the same eye, but I'm pretty sure always just one at a time), which expands after about 10 minutes into a flashing, jagged, rainbow-colored half-circle. The visual artifact expands across my vision and then drifts away over the course of about 15-20 minutes. Normal vision returns, and there's never any associated pain.  Maybe a little brain fog after. The more tired I am, the more episodes I'll have. 

I'm used to these by now, but for some reason, I also CAN'T get used to them. No matter what I tell myself, for those first 10 minutes of blind spot I'm always CONVINCED I'm going blind, or that I'll permanently lose vision in that spot.  It's not even a big spot, but it's still always anxiety-inducing, and I spend those 10 minutes or so intensely anxious.  When the colors show up, it's always a huge relief because I can reassure myself it's the same old thing and will be over in a few minutes. 

Does anybody else who suffers ocular migraines like these also get the panic?  How do you cope with it?  I get physical symptoms from the anxiety alone that take a while to pass, even though there are no physical symptoms from the migraine.  

Would love to hear any reassurances or tactics you have for dealing with the fear of vision loss when these hit!

1q23jn8,FL-41 glasses online?,"Hi, I currently have a couple of pairs of prescription glasses with the FL-41 tint that I purchased through my eye doctor. I find them very helpful for my light sensitivity and that they both prevent and ease migraine attacks. 
My question is, has anyone ordered prescription FL-41 glasses online? It looks like that may be quite a bit cheaper than going through my eye doctor. If you ordered them online, were you happy with the glasses and customer service? Please let me know who you went through and any tips. All advice appreciated, thank you in advance 😊",1767372300.0,2,8,migraine,mental_physical
1q235sn,My job was giving me constant migraines. Now I lost it but at least I have fewer migraines?,"Welp. I suspected this. My migraines in 2025 were progressively getting worse to the point in November I had nine migraine headache days and seemed like a constant prodrome. I had this situation at work where I felt like I was in a psychological experiment with people from different departments all angry I coudln't get them what they needed and the ability to get it to them rested on my department head who had really checked out. 

I think it was the pressure of this plus the inability to fix it that was breaking my brain possibly literally. I was a contract worker there...

Then I lost that gig on December 18. And I have not had a migraine headache since (though I have had some tinnitus). 

Yay, I guess?

I expect I will have one soon for other reasons like UNEMPLOYMENT and NO INCOME but hey, that trigger is gone, anyway. Don't recommend though",1767371449.0,51,8,migraine,mental_physical

This festive period has been really damn rough for me. I think the combination of lots of socialising/trying to be present and tonnes of triggers food and lifestyle wise has meant I've regressed hugely in my chronic migraine control and this week particularly has been attack after attack. 

Ironically I had my 3 month Emgality follow up today and my diaries (apart from this week) look great so they are happy for me to continue, but I find it so hard focussing on the positives when I'm stuck in a bad rut of attacks and feeling really unwell.

1q1zjlm,topiramate,"hey guys. december 24th i was prescribed topiramate 25mg for headaches by a neurologist and i started taking them a few days later. in less than a week ive become more depressed than ive been in quite some time and im scared to take my hydroxyzine for my anxiety due to potential interactions. i want to get off the topiramate so badly. i know side effects aren’t always forever while on a med but idk if i can deal with this while waiting for the effects to subside. this is mostly just a vent because im currently at work trying not to cry for seemingly no reason. 

i have another neurology appointment jan 28th but im unsure if i can stand to keep taking these meds that long and talk to the doctor then about it or if i should message my doctor beforehand and see about getting off of them. i just absolutely hate how they make me feel. i hate the nausea, the tingles in my hands, the depression, the overheating when im usually a freeze baby in the winter. this shit sucks.

I’ve had multiple MRIs over the years without contrast dye and finally I got a second opinion and they suggested I get an MRI with contrast. Welp, that one showed mild flattening of the posterior globes and mild prominence of the CS containing optic nerve sheaths, these are findings which can be seen in association with intracranial hypertension.

1q1yjm2,Migraine Help Please,"Hi everyone, I am new to reddit and was wondering if you could give me advice and share similar experiences.

I have been a migraine sufferer for the past 8 years of my life. I am 22 years old.

I have been prescribed 10mg amitriptyline every night as a preventative for the past nearly 4 years. Its worked great and it did reduce the frequency of migraines I was getting. However the past 9 days I have been waking up every morning with a migraine? I have taken the typical medication when in pain that has  usually worked like ibuprofen and if its really bad id take a sumatriptan which worked... Now its a different story. Sumatriptan is providing some relief but the pain keeps coming back the following day. The pain isnt as severe as I have experienced worse but its noticeable.

I have a doctor appointment coming up in a few days, however considering my situation, I was wondering what would typically be the next steps be for someone who is already taking 10mg amitriptyline every night as a preventative? Also considering that I have tried sumatriptan which worked like a charm in the past at getting rid of it completely, to now the pain is staying around and not going away.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, and shoutout to the fellow migraine sufferers on a daily basis too, its a nightmare living with this condition. ",1767360342.0,1,7,migraine,mental_physical

I woke up at 5AM with a migraine, took a rizatriptan without eating, so not as effective for me. Woke up again at 9AM less hurtful but still hurting, took some acetaminophen and ketoprofen, and its now 1PM, still there and I am pondering on taking a 2nd rizatriptan even though I know a 2nd one is not useful if the first one did not have any effect.

1q1uzo3,Botox for Migraines,"Hello All,


New to this subreddit. I have been suffering from Migraines for last 20 years now.

The frequency and severity of attacks vary a lot, but recently the frequency have been mild attacks, 2-3 times a week.

I have tried multiple medication combinations over these last 20 years, and none of them work for longer periods. I have tried Divalproex, flunarizine, Propranolol, topiramate, Amitriptyline and several others which I cannot remember. I even tried acetazolamide. The medicines either stop working after a couple of months or I get non-ignorable side effects. I have talked to multiple doctors also. Gone through Multiple MRIs.  

I am now thinking of Botox injections as a last resort. Have anyone here gone through all these? If yes what else helped them.",1767348695.0,1,7,migraine,mental_physical

Do any of you experience trauma from migraine?

Yesterday I had the worst chronic migraine of my life and the pain was so intense I was shaking, I vomited, I cried and was screaming at times. 

The migraine is almost gone now but I just feel traumatized from the whole experience??

And I feel terrible my partner had to see all of this (and thankful they were here to help).

How do you recover after such an episode? I genuinely feel traumatized by this experience.

Not looking for medical advice, but just some comfort and reassurance.

1q1s9e0,Starting Emgality and terrified,"So I’m starting Emgality next week and I’m so scared. I’ve never done an injectable medication before and I’m getting the auto injector (which is probably good, because while I’ve heard the syringe might hurt less, I could never do it to myself and other people scare me more). I’ve heard mixed reviews, but generally that it’s painful no matter where you inject it.

I have a couple questions: first, does the stomach feel… weird? I’ve never had an injection there and the thigh feels more natural, but people seem to prefer it.
Second, does the end of the medication (the click) also make any tactile sensation? I’ve seen people suggest music to avoid hearing it and getting startled, but I’m afraid of missing it and ending it early or messing up somehow.
Lastly, just how do I not panic so much about this? I really didn’t want to do injectables but nothing has worked enough and we need to try it, so I’m trying to suck it up but really struggling.

I’d appreciate any help on all of this! Thank you!",1767338479.0,1,22,migraine,mental_physical

I played it for the first time for 2-3 hours last night and by the end, my head was pounding. I would take breaks and drink water, and yet I was miserable. I had fun playing the game itself and I wanted to keep playing, but my head was killing me. I went upstairs to go to bed/take pain medicine and suddenly got hit with a bout of nausea and the headache quickly turned into a migraine. I played again tonight for a shorter amount of time, and I got another headache but no nausea.

I wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this. For reference, Pokemon ZA is meant to be played at a faster frame rate (60fps) but switch 1 can only handle 30fps. I don’t normally suffer from motion sickness, so this hit me out of the blue.",1767337496.0,5,4,migraine,mental_physical

When I was ready to go back on contraceptives, my doctors agreed on the progesterone only pill. I’ve been on that for maybe 9 months now (I can’t even remember) and have come to realize I really don’t enjoy it. I also have adhd, so remembering to take it the same time is a struggle as is, the breakthrough bleeding, acne, and honestly on top of that my migraines have been consistently worse. May or may not be from this but I don’t
Think it’s helping.

I am still looking to be on some from of contraceptive because I do not want another baby any time soon but it feels like my options are limited. Right now, my two options are either switching to cycle tracking with the Oura ring and natural cycles and just being careful and taking control over my own body; which I love as I really hate being on any types of hormones.. the other option I have been looking into is the Nuvaring.

• Pain and pressure in the face, in forehead, around my eyes, nose, septum, my cheeks, both sides of my head, temples, back of my head, on top of my head and even feel the pressure in the roof of my mouth and my top back teeth, feels like severe tightening, pressing and crushing sensation, throbbing and pulsating, throbbing and pulsating has seem to increase and has become more frequent in the last year, now experiencing pulsating feeling in other parts of my body (neck, shoulders, chest, arms and even my fingers), Aching pains sometimes, Rush of sharp pains sometimes, burning sometimes, pressure feels like imploding, in the early stage of the symptoms the head pressure started as episodic then got progressively worse to the point it became constant and now there is never a moment when I don't feel the headache 
• Neck discomfort and feel like I have to adjust my neck often, squeezing & tightening feeling in my neck and throat 
• Tingling Feeling in my head (sometimes radiates to my neck and shoulders), tingling and numbing in my hands, feet & legs sometimes. 
• Light headedness 
• difficult to breathe through my nose often (particularly when I feel a lot of pressure on my septum I feel like I struggle to breathe through my nasal airway)
• Nasal congestion, stuffy nose, have to blow my nose often, have to spit out congestion often
• Sleep disturbances, often times (especially now) my upper body like my arms, shoulders, chest and neck will tense up or feel numb when I start to drift off to sleep and it leads to me involuntarily shake myself awake before I can fully go to sleep, keeping me awake.
• Brain fog, confusion, difficulty concentrating, difficulty in thinking, difficulty remembering (have a lot more trouble with short term memory and recent events), can barely remember last night after getting up out of bed, feel loopy & dopey at times, mental fatigue (mental fatigue is so bad I often don't feel like interacting with anyone or even talking), general feeling of being out of it, feels like a constant state of being on a powerful drug
• Lack of energy and weakness, weakness gets so bad sometimes I feel like I can hardly stand on my feet
• Fatigue, have to take more frequent naps
• Double vision (especially when I widen my eyes), eyes more sensitive to light, sometimes I see what looks like shooting stars scattering in my eyes (particularly when I sneeze), when I lay down and close my eyes to go to sleep I see polkadots and squiggly lines (this happens particularly when I'm drowsy and ready to go to bed at night), just about everytime I lay down and close my eyes and then open my eyes I see this weird optical thing where I see a black dot in front of me in the center of my vision (it's there briefly and often times resembles a bug or a spider).
• Feel disoriented often
• Dizziness and feeling woozy often
• Feeling off balance when I walk often and even when standing in place I still feel unsteady. 
• Motion sensitivity even when watching movies, watching videos or playing video games
• Vertigo, feels like sinking into the floor and something pulling my body directly down, often after being on an elevator 
• When I'm in a vehicle and come to a complete stop or parked the vehicle feels like it's moving when it isn't 
• When I turn my head back and forth I feel vertigo and my head pressure increases afterwards and I also noticed whenever I turn my head back and forth I hear clicking in the back of my head every time.
• All the dizziness including the vertigo and balance issues have started at the same time that the pain and pressure in my head started
• Inside of my mouth has a weird floppy feeling (also started around the same time)
• Ringing of the ears frequently (starting to become constant)
• Ear pain and pressure (including sharp pains) and ears more sensitive to sound (especially at concerts) and tends to make my head feel worse 
• Ears tend to feel stuffy & full, there are moments when my ears feel like they have water in them
• Pounding sensation in my ears when hearing sound at times (when hearing someone's voice through a phone for example)
• Wind blowing through car windows hurts my ears often 
• Nausea at times (especially when the symptoms are at their worst)
• Muscle spasms, one night in early 2022 muscle spasms in my face got so bad that areas on right side of face like around my eye spasmed, lips spasmed and even my tongue spasmed, to the point I had trouble talking, and the spasming forced my jaw to clench involuntarily, I thought I was having a stroke
• Caffeine, smoking, drinking, lots of sugar intake and certain medications seem to be triggers
• Night of August 28 2025 felt a sharp pain in my right ear when holding the speaker of my phone to my ear to listen to music, at a low volume, then the pain radiated to my right eye, and then felt vertigo
• So far the only three medications that I've tried that helped my pain and discomfort (to a certain degree) are Clonazepam, Fioricet and Amitriptyline but discontinued the Amitriptyline due to other problems it was causing and can only take the Fioricet once in awhile due to rebound headaches and I took the clonazepam back in 2022 when my symptoms escalated from mild and episodic to really bad and constant and had to discontinue that because of it being habit forming and it would give me really bad withdrawals. 
• General feeling of sluggishness, feel feverish often and a general feeling of being unwell 
• Night of October 19 2025 dad played a movie with loud music playing on his laptop several inches away from me on my left and the music felt so much louder in my right ear specifically as if I were wearing an ear bud that's set full blast
• Can't enjoy a lot of the things I used to
• Symptoms have been ongoing for five years 
• With the knowledge of most things being ruled out at this point, the symptoms themselves and with further research I have discovered issues that I feel are worth talking about as they could be possibilities. My recent research includes things like vestibular migraine, Otologic migraine, Transformed migraine (which apparently is a combination of both migraine and tension headaches and that's pretty much what my symptoms feel like), new persistent daily headache, intracranial pressure, Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension, and possibly inner ear issues such as Ménière’s disease, Eustachian tube dysfunction, Ear Barotrauma, Labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis. 
• As of October of 2025 I noticed there is a lump in the back of my neck on my left side and there is pain where the lump is and there is another lump that is smaller on the back of my neck that's close to the bigger one. The pain seems to be minor at the moment but if the pain gets worse I will update. Don't know if this issue is related or not but I should probably talk to somebody about it.
• Have a history of GERD/reflux. I'm wondering if that could be a possible factor. I took a PPI almost everyday for a few years which I'm also wondering if that may also be a factor since these symptoms started happening to me since I've been taking it. Took a long break in year of 2025 from taking pantoprazole and started taking it again as of November 2025 due to the reflux coming back and getting out of control. Since the reflux has come back I am having more throat problems such as hoarse, raspy & gurgled voice, having to clear my throat often, irritated & Itchy throat, coughing more often, dry throat & mouth, neck seems to tense up more. UPDATE since I have started back on the pantoprazole the headache symptoms feel significantly worse including the brain fog and I'm typing this as of November 23 2025.
• Lately as of November of 2025 I noticed that when I turn my head to my left and then turn it back there is clicking somewhere in the back of my head.
• Symptoms seem to give me the most trouble at night/more attacks at night
• On Christmas Eve morning 2025 I fell asleep in my recliner before going to bed and when I woke up my upper body felt numb and paralyzed (shoulders, arms & chest) and I could not move them for a brief moment. This has happened to me twice now. And there are occasions when my symptoms make my limbs feel a little numb.
• All symptoms seem to be getting progressively worse each year the longer I go without any treatment and headache attacks are becoming more frequent and more intense. The daily symptoms feel worse day by day at this point as I'm typing this late December of 2025, approaching the new year. The daily pain is unbearable and unmanageable at this point and I have headache attacks everyday now and the attacks feel like repeated loud air horns on both sides of my head and severe head pressure and ear pain and severe sensitivity to sound and is accompanied by intense ear ringing and nausea. Just people yelling around me makes my headache worsen especially when I'm in the middle of an attack. I can't even listen to music with my earbuds anymore without it hurting my head.
• Before I had all of these crazy symptoms and I was feeling normal, I listened to music with my earbuds in my ears all the time, maybe even excessively for many years since highschool. So if there's a possibility that this is an inner ear problem, I wonder if that may have been a factor in all of this.
• No quality of life anymore. It's at the point it feels like it's completely disabling me and I feel out of commission. I feel like I can't have a job even if I wanted to, drive or even have a social life because of it. Back in early 2022 when my symptoms were escalating and started feeling really bad I thought I was dying (the time I started taking the clonazepam to help the pain) and then after a couple of months the symptoms calmed down enough that they were manageable for a long time, from sometime mid 2022 to January of 2025, and then suddenly my symptoms started to feel gradually worse from there to the point they don't feel manageable anymore and now as I'm typing this on December 29 2025 I'm back to feeling like I'm dying again. Only I feel like it's worse now than it's ever been and I feel like I'm being tortured. I can't even cope. This problem is ruining my life and honestly giving you this document and to other specific specialists who are also helping in my case is about the only thing I know to do at this point and I'm starting to lose hope of ever getting better and It feels so devastating to know that I can never go back to having the quality of life I had before this started happening to me and can never go back to feeling like the person I once was. There are a significant number of things and treatments I haven't tried yet so I don't know. Hopefully I can find at least one treatment that helps more than what I've tried so far. I'm not telling you all of this to earn pity points. I just really need help and I feel alone in this battle because it's not like this is a common problem and I don't know anybody personally who has anything like this and there's not many people who understands what I'm going through. And I don't think it's anything genetic because I don't know anybody in the history of my family that's had anything like this either. People and even other doctors don't take you seriously and treat you like you're a hypochondriac, got mental issues or just overreacting. They don't get it. Even my own family who I live with struggle to understand. So yeah it's a very lonely battle and one that I feel like I'm losing. This is all taking such a mental toll on me and giving me a serious case of PTSD. Hopefully when you've read all of this, we can shed some light on what I'm actually dealing with and hopefully find a solution. I thank you for your time to hear me out.

This is not with me not asking for help or anything either if anyone thinks it may be that because I am also autistic and have bad anxiety and those have also not been addressed before I even developed migranes and now both me and my parents are starting to think that maybe I should leave school as soon as I turn 18 to focus on doctors appointments and getting my migranes under control as for legal reasons I cant start certain medications until im 18 like certain SSRI's and things along those lines but the conflict im having is that I dont want to lose out on my education and at the end of it if I cant seem to get my migranes under control not be able to get a job either as im having them almost daily.


So im really looking for any advice that other people who have experienced these types of situations might recommend as I am at this point utterly clueless about what to do ",1767321414.0,0,6,migraine,mental_physical

1q1lv7b,New daily persistent headaches and neuralgia,I was diagnosed with NDPH in 2021 after being on at least 8 migraine meds and failing since 2015. I was waking up daily with a headache and it never went away. Sometimes so painful I would almost pass out. The neurologist suggested Botox. I have been doing that since then and had relief. But as of 3 months ago the pain has come back with a vengeance. Debilitating head pain that makes me non-functioning. It literally feels like I'm on fire from the inside. My neurologist has offered nothing but continuing the Botox and high doses of Gabapentin. I can't work. I can't participate in my children's activities. I'm completely useless. No one will help with the pain. You are automatically a drug seeker. This pain is different than anything I have ever had in my headache journey but no one will listen. I just need a doctor to listen and hear me. I need someone in Texas who treats chronic headaches/ migraines with pain in the supraorbital area and sharp zap like pains in the head. I have to be able to function. There has to be better treatment of patients with chronic pain. Does anyone else suffer with similar symptoms? ,1767318974.0,1,2,migraine,mental_physical
1q1kunb,studying as a migraine trigger & workarounds for uni ?,"bit of a long post so TLDR: I'm looking for any input or advice on studying/concentration as a migraine trigger and balancing migraine and uni/academics!

hi! I (F20), am new to the migraine thing, having only had my first one just over 3 months ago. since then though it's been pretty unrelenting, as I'm consistently having about ~3/4 migraines a week and a constant headache at all other times. 

I've posted here previously and while I've been going through the slow process of trialling various preventatives and also experimenting with different acute relief options, I was encouraged to push for more testing with how sudden it's all been (which was really validating to hear!!). the issue was taken out my hand as a couple weeks ago I had a thunderclap headache that resulted in a nearly week long hospital stay while I had various tests and scans, thankfully though I was given the all clear so it's back to the drawing board.

(in case anyone is a pro with neurology (despite being a life science student neuroscience was always my weakest area which is quite ironic now I suppose) I had a plain CT come up clear, then a lumbar puncture (ouch!) that was good except for raised xanthochromia. this then got me a contrast CT venogram and angiogram brain which came up okay so I was discharged but will be put on a long neurology wait-list when I follow up with my GP. while I'm obviously in the process of working with medical professionals, if this means anything to anyone or they have any ideas give me a shout haha)

I'm currently a 3rd year university student doing a 4 year course that's pretty demanding, so as you can imagine this has affected my studies pretty severely. (people keep asking me if they think pure stress has triggered my migraine onset but honestly I've been looking to this year for ages since I really love my degree and this is the year we finally get to do cool lab experiments.) 

if I don't pull things together soon and find a way to cope it's looking like I'll probably have to repeat the year, which I can make my peace with but I wanna give it one last shot, especially because, due to student finance reasons, I'm not able to pull out of the year now to take care of my health then return to repeat next year. unless things get very dire I have to at least go through the motions of trying to pass this year. 

my issue is, every time I sit down to work, or am trying to listen to a lecture, regardless of if it's in class, in front of a screen or in bed, this causes my headache to worsen and quite often triggers a migraine. while it's not my only migraine trigger it's a frequent one.

I've seen that stress or eye strain and stuff can put people over the threshold into triggering migraine but I've not seen that for focus/concentration, does anyone else experience this ?

 additionally the brain fog is really affecting my academics as I'm just in no was as smart as I was a few months ago, I'm operating on such a different level now.

does anyone here have an workarounds or tricks or coping methods or strategies or anything for balancing migraine and uni/academics ?

1q1k2s8,Ringing in the new year with a bang...,"[TLDR: forgot my meds, spent new year in hell, was saved by a stranger]

The indoor waterpark in my town does this big event for New Years Eve and I take my kiddo every year because it is indoors and warm (as opposed to the Canadian outdoors, which are unpredictable but definitely cold).

It is loud, and full of bright lights and reflections, and strongly smells of over-chlorinated pool. 

Shocking nobody, a migraine erupted at about 7pm. I went to the locker room and opened my swim bag and discovered I had forgotten to pack my rescue meds. But the kiddo was having fun and really looking forward to the fireworks so I decided to tough it out for the next five hours. Bought popcorn and a coke and tried to treat it with salt and caffeine, which actually worked for a while. 

But by 11 I couldn't do it anymore. I stumbled back to the dressing room and sat on a bench with a towel in my lap because I couldn't lift it around my shoulders, and just stared at the locker in front of me trying to remain statue-still because every miniscule movement was blindingly nauseating. I had to get dressed. I had to figure out how to get us home. I had driven there but was going to have to abandon my car in the parking lot overnight, suck up the surge charges, and call an Uber. But I couldn't even walk. 

I heard a family talking about having overdone it and needing some tylenol. I shuffled down the bench gingerly and, trying not to cry but not really succeeding, asked if they had any with them that they could spare. 

The grandma pulled a pill bottle out of her purse. She opened it up and there were at least 8 different medications mixed together, none of which I could identify. She handed me two pills, told me she hoped I felt better soon, and wished me a happy new year. I swallowed them dry. 

Not sure what grandma gave me, but about 20 minutes later I was able to get dressed and join my kiddo back at the side of the pool for the countdown and fireworks show, though they were far too bright for my poor optic nerve and I looked at the ground for them. 

Thanks, grandma, you saved my new years.

This year's resolution is to make sure I actually have my rescue meds every. single. time I walk out the door.

1q1hpi3,What are your Botox injections like?,"Rant —

I’ve been getting Botox injections for over a year now from an anesthesiologist (my neurologist doesn’t do them). He’s great — very fast and painless, symmetrical injection sites, I never bleed, and he’s cautious of areas I’ve had issues with in the past. 

However, sometimes he has resident doctors training under him giving the injections instead. Despite being under his direction, they SUCK. Literally EVERY time a resident Dr gives me injections, I cannot believe how incompetent they seem. One resident put too much in my neck muscles and I couldn’t hold up my head for more than 5 mins for a MONTH afterwards. Another time a resident missed half of the injection sites on my forehead and then lied to both me and the actual Dr when questioned if he did. Another did my trap injections so far down on my shoulders that I felt their needle scraping my collarbones. They go painfully slow but not slow enough to do the job right. They never give the injections symmetrically so I always have a droopy eyebrow after, they inject Botox so deeply I feel the needle crackling against my skull, and I bleed EVERYWHERE — like, blood running down my face and neck ruining my clothes. 

None of this happens when my actual doctor does it. He’s amazing. I’ve asked him time and time again PLEASE no resident doctors, but he seems to forget every time, and I’m so fed up. ",1767307990.0,5,13,migraine,mental_physical

1q1h7k3,Let my family down- didn’t get on the plane 😩,"Haven’t felt this low about my migraines in a long time, I was supposed to be going to Germany tonight for a 3 day break with my sister and nephews. I woke up early this morning with a migraine, did all my usual things like taking a triptan, several hours of rest,lots of water, fresh air, ice pack, painkillers, I vomited a few times too which I don’t normally do.

And it just kept getting worse, however they usually last approx 6 hours so I thought by the time we get to the airport (2 hours away) it would be gone. It got worse so when we got there I had to tell them there’s a chance I won’t be able to come, I’ve never flown with a migraine before and if it wasn’t such a severe one I’d be less worried.

I kept pushing through, had a coffee as that can help, got some ice water, did some breathing exercises and the pain and nausea got worse. We made it to the boarding gate and I asked to speak to a staff member about if it’s even safe to fly with a severe migraine. Two guys spoke to me, one said he doesn’t know of any medical reason I can’t fly and the other man was a migraine sufferer himself and he’s flown lots of times with a migraine and as it’s only a short flight I’d be “absolutely fine “.

However it’s easy to say this when it’s not your migraine and not your head, and my fear was the air pressure changes might irritate my head even more and cause unbearable pain. I tried to trust my instincts and just felt I couldn’t cope with the flight. I really had felt so so unwell all day and I was feeling weak.

I made the decision to not go, but I asked if there was a flight there tomorrow I could get on if I’m better. My sister and nephews had to board by now and they looked so sad and disappointed- I know I’ve let them down as I keep doing because of these stupid migraines. I’m so sick of them ruining everything.

I’m now in a hotel at the airport and waiting to see if I’m well enough to fly tomorrow, I just feel I’m not a mentally strong person as I should have just sucked it up and got on the plane. Would be interested in what others would do in this situation?

EDIT TO UPDATE: I’ll try to reply to everyone’s comments when I can, this is the first time I’ve had proper phone service and been able to charge my phone as I forgot my portable charger and plug. I woke up free from the migraine and got myself on that next flight, it then took several hours of travel on public transport (in a country I’ve never been to) to get to my sister and nephews but I was determined to make it there and was so amazing to be reunited with them! It was also fun to travel alone like that and have faith in myself that I can do these things on my own if need be, so am trying to see the positives!

1q1e319,Qulipta has been life changing but I’m nervous about insurance,"Started Qulipta a few months ago and it’s been absolutely amazing for me.

I’ve tried Nurtec and propranolol before and neither really helped all that much. Before Qulipta I was getting around 15 to 20 migraines a month. Now I’m down to maybe 2 to 4 and even those are pretty manageable. It’s honestly been a night and day difference.

I’m on 60mg right now and it’s working so well that it’s actually making me anxious about insurance. I work in sales and turnover is pretty high. Migraines definitely affect my performance. To be completely honest I probably oversold myself a bit to get my current role. I can sell myself very well. I had one job for 5 years but the two roles after that only lasted about two months each and a big part of that was migraines killing my consistency.

Because of that I’ve been thinking about whether it would be crazy to cut my dose in half and take 30mg a day just to build up a small stockpile in case something happens with insurance or employment. The last thing I want is to finally find something that works and then lose access to it.

I really can’t wait until meds like this are as accessible as topiramate propranolol triptans etc.

1q1dktw,Migraine medication vs. period (question!),"Hi! I have a question just to see if anyone else has experienced this (I'm not looking for medical advice or anything 😢).

I was taking Topiramate for a year and a half, to prevent migraines —I started with 25 mg, then 50 mg, and finally reached 100 mg. 

I was also taking 25 mg of Trittico (trazodone) to lower my anxiety at night and also prevent migraines. I took both at night before bed (I'm speaking in the past tense because I've stopped taking all these medications).

The point is, eventually the side effects drove me crazy. I couldn't stand them anymore. They greatly increased my anxiety (I lost about 10 kg and even broke out in a lot of acne), so I stopped taking them. One of those side effects was a very noticeable change in my period. My menstrual cycle used to last about 5 days, but in the last few months it's only lasted 1-2 days, with the brownish discharge...

I switched neurologists, and she suggested I might have stopped ovulating because of all this ""heavy stuff""... I haven't confirmed this with a gynecologist yet, but I've thought about it a lot, and it makes sense... 🥲

1q1c3zq,I hate my head,"The other day I was talking to a friend of my dads who has a lot of migraines for years and we talked a lot about the subject in general, which made me realise I have „tension headaches“ most of the time and migraines only rarely (tho it is apparently easily switvhed up? Idk)

Anyways since Christmas rhere has been one singular day without a headache. 2-3 a week is normal, but daily is not for me and I hate this. Migraines are rare but guess who developed one TODAY in the middle of work..

On that note, I work at a trampoline park, with loud music, shouting kids and someone constantly asking me for stuff. Not a fun 5 hour shift 😀 I got home, tried my fries and coke remedies which didnt work and am now just gonna suffer till the end of rhis :,) I just wanted to be pissed off, while my brain still allows me to look at my phone.

1q1bpf6,Walking kinda helped with my migraine,"So… idk if this is common, but I get migraines every now and then, I haven’t had one since nov last year.
My migraines aren’t that painful objectively, but the constant throbbing drives me insane, it’s like torture 
My automatic response to an episode is to take analgesics and sleep it out, and this time was no different.
It started becoming unbearable around noon, and I had like 12 hours of sleep yesterday (fun fact: both long and short sleep trigger my migraines)so I couldn’t sleep lol
I heard about something called somatic therapy a couple of days ago, where you try to focus on other parts of your body (for me it was my legs and hands) and basically try to ignore the pain… It helped but the moment I stopped the pain would come back. 
Then, I drew a bath of HOT water and submerged my feet in it to test my theory. it kinda worked. 
Not fully, but definitely better than sitting in my bed in constant torture basically begging my brain to let me sleep.
By now I had a theory (constant stimulation helps to  dull the pain?) 
Walking around was the easiest thing I could think of, so I did that and guess what?
It actually worked. No pain at all... I know this may not work for everyone (of course it’s different for everyone), but I think it’s worth mentioning.",1767293486.0,4,5,migraine,mental_physical
1q1ajp3,Supplement advice?,"Hello everyone. I promise I’m not asking for medical advice, and I am aware I should always discuss with my physician when introducing any supplements into my diet. I simply wanted to ask for those who have experience taking supplements, for advice on if they noticed a difference in symptoms and if the ones I plan to introduce are overkill or not.

With that being said, I was planning on purchasing Pure Encapsulations Magnesium Glycinate (120mg serving), MigreLief Original with Puracol (180mg of Magnesium Citrate/Oxide mix, + 200mg Riboflavin), and lastly CoQ10 (200mg serving). I was going to start taking each one daily (once). 

I’m basically at yet another point of desperation and am wondering if I should try these out to see if they make any difference at all in prevention even though I am very doubtful. ANY advice is appreciated. Thank you!",1767290724.0,1,8,migraine,mental_physical

1q13ict,Differences in triptans,"Hi and happy new year. My migraines are without aura (maybe I have some but there is no pattern so I am not sure about this) and then I have vestibular migraines as well. I have only tried Sumatriptan and Rizatriptan. Sumatriptan makes me nauseous and gives me a weird pulling sensation in my tongue/throat/chest but I feel it works better as an abortive no matter when I take it during an attack. But it doesn't work as well on my hormonal migraines so my primary physician has me trying out Rizatriptan. It works faster and only makes me a bit drowsy but it never stops the attacks completely.

I can't really decide if I should just accept this or bring it up with my physician again.

Aside from the migraines, I’m a completely healthy, fit 20 year old boy. It started when I was 17.
It happens every day with almost no exceptions. However, it’s not as intense as what many others experience with migraines. I’m not bedridden, and I’m still able to do sports with effort. (Which i think is a huge benefit) 

I just want to know if its even worth trying or if im too long in this state that is not possible to reverse this. Is there anyone who was in a similar situation and got out of it. (30/30 migraines per month to maybe just 20/30)

1q0uln1,Anyone Else Struggle To Describe Head Symptoms??,"Does anyone else have head symptoms they struggle to explain to others? 

I get full-blown flares but also way more frequently (almost daily) I get what I describe to my partner as “my head being bad”. It’s like an extreme discomfort that’s a mix of nausea, brain fog, maybe low level pain but not really?? I don’t know how to explain it but it impacts my life a lot and is frequently accompanied by fatigue. It’s one of the main disabling symptoms and I don’t know how to explain it, let alone get help for it :(( does anyone else experience something similar?? Is it just a stronger brain fog?? It often improves when I lie down or have a nap, but not always. I get 8-9h of sleep most nights and have been very consistent in wake up times for the last few weeks.

For context, I’ve had migraine flares for 3ish years. Mine started with my most significant symptoms being nausea and fatigue +/- mild pain and photophobia every day. I’m on Propanolol daily as a preventative and use sumatriptan, paracetamol, and/or prochlorperazine when I have a proper episode. I generally don’t take NSAIDs due to GI issues and used to take Rizatriptan but hated the taste (I’m autistic and would avoid taking it). I’m definitely triggered by burnout/stress and weather (storms) but haven’t nailed down anything else. Ironically, my best period of migraine-less symptoms was right after I had COVID. I got bad migraines during my acute illness for about 2 weeks, but forced myself to do literally nothing except sleep and eat and recover, so I think having all that recovery time actually helped my migraines long-term for a bit. Probably something to do with burnout etc.

I just graduated and have 1 more month before starting my (unfortunately relatively high-stress) career so really trying to improve my general baseline and quality of life before then. My flares are less frequent but the weird “head being bad” is still very frequent, almost daily.

I’m moving regions so will have a new GP so want to bring it up with them and hopefully get a neuro referral (I’ve never been to one before). I live in Aotearoa NZ if any other folks are also here.

Thanks in advance, I don’t know if I’m just having interoception issues describing my head symptoms or if I genuinely just don’t know the term for the experience.",1767238022.0,7,2,migraine,mental_physical

1q0u7k3,Guided Meditation/Meditation Music,"I’m thinking about making myself some guided meditation stuff to help with sleeping.

I’ve tried lots of different ones out there but sometimes I tend to be very picky with it. Sometimes the audio is too much, sometimes the voice. Sometimes I find a good one but there’s rain and I wake up because it’s basically an instant bathroom thing.

So far my best by far one I’ve found that relaxes me the best is Meditainment’s My Secret Garden but all their other ones tend to bother me. It’s weird. But after a while it gets old and it’s only 20mins, not a full sleep.

So I’m thinking about making my own with like fun little dream stuff that’s still kinda relaxing.

So I’m just wondering what other people find for themselves that work okay for them? Or if anyone else has tried this method to help themselves and whether it’s worked out or helped with their migraines?

I’m basically using ChatGPT to help me understand what I’m trying to do.
Apparently what I’m aiming for is closer to “self-soothing immersive imagery” or “parasympathetic anchoring” or “narrative containment” or something like that. 

I’m sure stuff like this exists out there but sometimes I’m very sensitive to different audios except the one I mentioned earlier. I couldn’t find information on the music composer and the closest I’ve gotten is A-D-low E strings on my guitar. ChatGPT said something about the notes being low and simplistic is probably why it doesn’t bother me as much as most “migraine audios”.

If any of you guys have tried this or found some similar? That’d be great! Otherwise I’m taking to Audacity and some AI voices and free sound things to make myself some guided sleep stuff.

Do you guys find that voice guided ones or just sound effect guided ones are better for certain times? I might try both options and see.

Do you guys know of anywhere that might be good to store them? I’m thinking of private uploads to YouTube if I can so I don’t clog up my Google drive. Dunno how that works but cloud storage gets pricey.

Definitely gonna be a chore getting underway to start considering I’m using ChatGPT to help me find things to Google and understand what I’m googling

Today I tried pull up again and after 10 pull-ups the throbbing headache came back. I tried some sprints after that and the headache was also slightly triggered by it.

fast forward to a month later, same thing happens and neuro prescribes another steroid but it doesn’t help this time. 

i’ve been off the steroid for about a week and still no relief so he suggested ANOTHER round of steroids but it feels pointless since it didn’t work last time.

my migraines are somewhat responsive to my regular triptans and yes im on preventatives but its getting so frequent and really impacting my quality of life i dont know what to do. considering botox as my next move but neuro keeps wanting to up my topomax.

also for context, ive had chronic migraines since i was a kid and have had all sorts of testing done when i was first diagnosed and then again probably around 7-8 years ago. neuro doesn’t think anything is wrong, it’s just really chronic.

1q0ee0c,My mum doesn't seem to understand how bad my migraines are,"TLDR: I get migraines often and my mum thinks I m exaggerating how often it actually happens

'm 20 and have chronic pain and migrains. I get a migraine about even 2 weeks, or sometimes multiple in a week if there is extra stress in my life. Migraines run in my family and my mum gets them too just at a much lower rate. 

This morning as I was getting ready to leave the house I mentioned to my mum started talking about how we must get them differently because she has to lie down and can't do anything when she gets them. I had to explain because I am getting them frequently at the moment my life can't just stop because I have one and it's extremely boring and frustrating to just lie in a dark room for the majority of the day/week. She seems to think because I can get up and walk around that my pain must be less than hers.

She also started giving me a lecture about how I take to much exedrin, and that I need to stop and that she looked online and it's says I should stop. I had to explain that I have a plan with my doctor, and I am taking it as recommended. I also because of other medications I am on/addiction issues in the past limiting the thing I can take safely. I really try not to take it unless the pain gets to a certain point, but after that I just can't tolerate it!! I also will try other things like ice packs and cold showers before take it/if it doesn't work. I am trying to take it less but it's hard to know what to do about it when I am in the moment and am in pain.

I think to her it looks like I am just a bit tired and have a bit of a headache and am just saying it's a migraine cuz I don't know better. I'm not sure what to say to her to get her to understand that it is rly that bad, but I just  can't stay in bed all day! To be fair I am actually bad at going to bed when I need to but I often with get migraines for 3 days at time cuz of stress and it gets to a point where I am simply too bored to not do anything!!

Also I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense, or I am rambling I currently have one now and often talk nonsense when I get them. Advice on how to help her understand would be helpful ",1767191671.0,14,2,migraine,mental_physical
1q0dy9i,My lengthy but really impactful migraine story!!,"In April of 2019, my life changed in an instant.



One night, without warning, everything I knew about my body—and my future—collapsed. I went to bed a hardworking mother, a dependable employee, a present wife. I woke up in the middle of the night trapped in a body I no longer recognized.



More than twenty symptoms hit me at once. My lymph nodes were swollen, burning hot to the touch. My heart raced. My head throbbed. Fear took over. When I arrived at the emergency room, I struggled to explain what was happening because I didn’t understand it myself. I just knew something was terribly wrong.



That night was the beginning of a long, exhausting cycle—months of ER visits, unanswered questions, and doctors who couldn’t tell me why my body felt like it was attacking itself. I was scared, dismissed, and desperate. It wasn’t until months later that I found a doctor who truly listened and tried to help me regain some sense of function. Even then, answers remained elusive.



For years, I poured money, time, and hope into appointments, lab work, scans, and specialists. My family and friends watched me slowly unravel. I spent days barely able to get out of bed. I missed work. I missed moments with my children. My marriage strained under the weight of uncertainty and exhaustion. Chronic illness didn’t just affect my body—it touched every part of my life.



I was angry. I was grieving the woman I used to be. I just wanted to feel *normal* again.



There were nights when I cried in silence, begging for the pain to stop, begging for my old life back. But chronic illness doesn’t negotiate. Normal, as I once knew it, was no longer an option.



Over the last six years, I have tried more than fifty medications and treatments, searching for even a small measure of relief. Every day—every minute, every second—has been a battle. Some days, simply existing takes all the strength I have.



Yet, I am still here.



Instead of giving up, I chose to advocate—for myself and for others who are still searching for answers. I’ve had to accept that this is my new normal, but acceptance does not mean surrender. I refuse to stop asking questions. I refuse to stop pushing for care. And I refuse to let silence win.



Today, I carry multiple diagnoses: migraine with aura, complex migraines, endometriosis, alpha thalassemia minor, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and an enlarged pituitary gland. I continue to see specialists, and I continue to hope—not for perfection, but for progress. For functionality. For better days.



Chronic illness has stolen six years of my life.



But it will not steal my faith.

It will not steal my voice.

And it will not steal what’s left of my future.



I will press on. I will persevere. I will keep believing—choosing strength, choosing hope, and embracing whatever lies ahead with courage and optimism.



And if you are reading this and fighting your own unseen battle, know this: you are not weak, you are not alone, and your story matters too.",1767190443.0,11,2,migraine,mental_physical

1q08l0h,Thunderclap,"I had what I believe to be a thunderclap headache on the 14th of this month. I went to the bathroom to poop. Everything came out like water. I know it's TMI. But there was no exertion. And what followed seems to be life changing. I had an instant rush. Like a tidal wave of pain in my head. I immediately grabbed both sides of my head.

While still on the toilet and squeezed it hurt so bad. I literally that it was going to explode. I had a hot flash. And jack hammering pain. This seemed like 5-10 minutes long. I thought I was going to have to call my boss to come get me off the toilet. The intense pain went away after 5-10 mins.

And it felt like a normal headache.

I finished up in the bathroom. And went and popped an ibuprofen. And retuned to work. The headache was still there. Come the morning of the 18th. I drove myself to the ER. As I was scared. I still had a headache. And I was googling my symptoms. Which is never a good thing to do. I was at the ER for 5 hours. They did a CT scan w/o contrast.

And they said everything looks good.

Well I still have headaches. Only on the left side of my head.

Near the base of my skull. And sometimes it'll be in my left temple as well. Pain will vary between a 1-3. I am going to the DR today. As I believe something is not right. I'm mid 30s relatively healthy guy. I get migraines due to my time in the military. But this was like nothing I ever experienced And my head pain has never lasted this long b4.

Also to add. Nothing will help the pain medicine wise. My prescribed rizatription actually makes it worse.

Has anyone had similar experiences?

I’ve had a status migraine since covid started likely triggered by numerous covid infections, MCAS and a whole other host of severe inflammation issues I won’t get into.

I’ve been advocating with my Nuerolgist to let me try a Magnesium IV at an infusion center without needing to go to the ED. I have epilepsy and am very limited on options and already take Depakote for prevention of seizures.

She reluctantly finally did it but prescribed the order as an undiluted mini bag of 2g of magnesium. I have autonomic issues and am very sensitive to vasodilation because of my MCAS being in a constant flare for the last 4 years.

Holy sh*t. I’ve had extreme migraines since age 7 but I was not prepared for the head to to severe pain, chest pain, lightheadness and horrible side effects of taking it without a bolus of fluids.

I let the nurses know but it was an outpatient center and there’s really no getting ahold of a provider to change the order same day and I already had been waiting 6 months for her to do it so I wanted to try it.

1q06k8j,on month 3 of status migrainosus,"on a day in october i developed a migraine, something i occasionally dealt with- but had been upping in frequency over my college semester. Four days later it was still there, so I went to the ER and got a migraine cocktail for the first time. Symptoms improved a bit, but two days later while sitting in class I started to feel a numbing/tingling sensation in the entire right side of my body, i suddenly couldn’t hold my pencil and i started to feel disoriented as the pain grew. i ended up going to the ER again, to rule out stroke and such, and received another IV. 

Since then, the migraine, with constant body pain/motor symptoms of some sort (fatigue, extreme soreness, aching, tingling, shocking feeling, hand shaking — all on the side of the migraine, which will switch sides throughout the day) has been a part of my daily life.

i’ve been diagnosed with status migrainosus / intractable migraine with a slew of other jargon for my symptoms. 

Luckily I have a neurologist, but no treatment or pain medicine has worked so far. I have had occipital and trigeminal nerve blockers, botox intentions done 2 weeks ago, and tried the medications sumatriptan, valporic acid, nurtec, the typical migraine cocktails with some steroids, etc.

I am a college student and this has totally disrupted my life. I will most likely have to take the next semester off or do a very reduced workload as most days I am in debilitating pain and weakness and am unable to do anything. I also am an art student- and it sucks that I can’t use my hand(s) much before they start violently shaking 😭 

I can rarely go out, but I’ve learned to treasure my better days. I have constant ringing in my ears and extreme sensitivity to sound. Light still bothers me, but I feel like I’ve generally grown a tolerance. The actual migraine pain is often severe- I feel like someone is trying to crush my skull and stab all my nerves. It’s exhausting to deal with every day. 

I meet with my neurologist again in a few weeks to discuss how the botox went. The injections were two weeks ago and I have not felt a change so I worry it won’t help. We will discuss other options so if anyone has experienced anything similar, please let me know what helped you. or just words of support or advice. 

also, I have vulvodynia and issues with menstruation- i am on 3 month birth control to limit my period as it is incredibly painful. the migraine started after i had my period, but my neurologist does not think the migraine is hormonal. i guess it was more of a trigger? 

\++ i take psychiatric medications like lithium, which has limited the types of migraine medications i can take. does anyone else have this issue?

I also get the fun numbness around my body (arms and face mostly), confusion, brain fog, light sensitivity, nausea, and sometimes trouble reading. I have medication (rizatriptan I think) but since I get multiple auras in a row, I only take it for the first aura so it usually doesn’t work.

She gave me two shots, I think sumatriptan and a steroid? She gave me a prescription for sumatriptan as well. So far, it isn’t working. I’ve tried every OTC pain relief, the ER previously gave me a medicine that says it’s but/acetaminophen/caffeine  but that didn’t help either. I have a referral for a neurologist but the hospital says they haven’t received it yet and that I can’t schedule an appointment yet.

This migraine has lasted a month at this point. Nothing is helping. I keep having to call out of work because I can’t function enough to be there(I work a desk job, staring at screens for eight hours a day). I’ve been trying all the “hacks” I see online, heat, ice, and nothing is helping. I don’t know what else to do and I don’t know how long I can keep living like this.

1pzlkgf,I Thought I'd Cracked It,"I've been having sparodic migraines for the past 15yrs now, I'm 45. They came out of nowhere during a stressful time in my life and decided to never leave. 



I get visual Auras with Zigzags and blind spots followed by crippling pain. The visual stuff can last upto half an hour to a hour and once the attack is over I'm left with a massive hangover. 



Depending on the strength of the attack depends on what other symptoms will want to join in, I can forget words and how to read, confusion and pins and needles in my face and arms with complete numbness. 

  
Strangely I would always get attacks in 3s. Luckily after reading some of the horror stories on here mine are occasional with months between attacks. 

  
My recent run of no attacks has been 6 months and I got cocky thinking I had solved my underlying issues, I've been using Magnesium Bisglycinate and trying to drink 2 liters of water and Electrolytes for the salt every day. I actually felt great, even had 2 nights out without a hangover the next day due to hydration. 

  
Then Christmas eve was preping the food and bang, Migraine. Took some meds went to bed for the night. Christmas day woke up sore but hopeful. But no 3 more attacks that day, missed the whole of Christmas in bed and the hungover feeling for the next few days. Thought I was in the clear starting the week then Monday night in work hit with another. Had to leave early. 

  
So here I am wondering where I've gone wrong after having none for 6 months, I definitely think it's something to do with stress and hydration levels, maybe I was slacking, but I've taken magnesium and electrolytes religiously at this point. So I dunno. Maybe I just want to rant with people who understand. ",1767109934.0,11,10,migraine,mental_physical

My headaches have been extremely disabling since the last 2 years. My biggest trigger is emotional stress and that sucks because life isn't getting any easier. I am a spiritual person and I try to meditate, I journal, I write my affirmations. I try to stay on that track but the moment these headaches return, I feel the world crashing around me. I really mean it. Crashing. The thoughts of ""why me?"" People around me enjoy their lives and go about their days SO DIFFERENTLY. They NEVER have to worry about this random pain that strikes any time of the day and leaves me helpless over the sink, puking. I am in a medical field and it is very demanding. I am determined to fulfill that demand and BAAM. PAIN. Everything is crashing again. People chugging caffiene, up early/late at night, concentrating for hours straight- and Im over the sink. Puking. Crying. Just asking why me. It's gets really bad- constant pain every single day. Puking. Pain. Repeat.

It's difficult to keep in touch with people because while they have 10 different things to talk about, I am left with this pain. I am a single child, 24F and I feel terribly guilty that my parents still have to worry about my health while it's time that I take over and look after them. I can hear my mother sigh when I tell her I'm having another headache and I know she doesn't mean anything bad. Perhaps she is just tired. 

Is it always a migraine-attack?
No. Most of my headaches are induced by some triggers but not classically like migraine. Sometimes I get bilious headaches too- my mom had it when she was young, too. It engulfs the entire head, is constantly aching and associated with nausea and vomiting. No medicine works for this. And honestly this fucks me up because my migraines respond to NSAIDs. But this fucker is a beast. It has no cure.

Have I tried medications?
Yes. I have been put on beta blockers, amitriptyline. The latter fucked my health up.

There was a consultantion pror to it too. During the hour I was fine. Once I was out my migraine started getting worse. By the time I reached home, I was ready to saw my head off and fling it around.

It seemed to work progressively better for each day, but after 1 month i'm getting a headache at the top of my head DAILY. I know this is caused by losartan/candesartan beacuse the headache goes away a couple of hours before its time for my next dose or when i quit the medicine completly. Candasartan completly cured my headache and migraines, but I get this new headache instead that only responds to aspirin so far.

I suspect my baseline daily headache/migraine is due to orthostatic intolerance/POTS due to its orthostatic nature, it dissapears when laying down and gets worse the longer I stay upright, eventuelly triggering a migraine. ARBs can work for some POTS subtypes (beacuse it can increase nitric oxide). My blood pressure is low even before starting losartan.

In march this year my eyes went 'funny' and it scared me, after about 20 minutes I could see properly again. A few months later the same thing happened but after my eyes went back to normal my head started hurting. I looked up what I could see when my eyes go funny and came across aura migraines. Then on December 14th it happened again but without my head hurting after. Christmas day I woke with a headache took paracetamol and I felt a little better for the day then the aura happened late afternoon and my head started hurting following the aura. Today I have had a headache all day but no aura, the pain is behind my eyes/eyebrows, my eyeballs hurt, my brain hurts and feels like its throbbing or being squeezed I don't even know, sometimes it's hard to describe. 

Each time the aura happens the other symptoms I get are slightly different. Most of my headaches involve things like light and noise sensitivity, sometimes nausea, anxiety, sinus areas hurt.

I (F36) have had migraines since childhood. I don't remember not having migraines. Saw pediatric neuro early on, got them mostly managed. Progressed in teen years, tried various preventive meds. Settled on topamax, worked great for years, then the ""dopamax"" started, even at the lowest possible dosage. Stopped taking it in college, went gluten free, after withdrawal migraines, mostly gone. Great.

Had some migraines over the next 8-10 years but managed with NSAIDS, ice packs, maxalt from PCP. Over the last 5-7 years they have gotten BAD. More frequent, more intense, meds aren't working. Lots of neck pain involved. They start in my neck and switch to a full blown migraine, nausea, all over misery. Meds help some. 

My neck is NEVER not tight and sore. I've been to PT multiple times over the last 4 years. Helps, then it doesn't. It got REALLY bad this summer and I went to a doctor and have been doing orthostatic manipulative therapy for 3 months. Not helping. Waiting for my latest referral to PT AGAIN.

I'm anemic, saw hematology and was promptly scheduled for an iron infusion. Single digit hemoglobin will do that. It's been 4 weeks, its helped some but we thought it would help MORE. Now - since the infusion, I didn't have any migraines until my period this month. My migraines never used to be related to my cycle but since the anemia got bad, period seems to trigger a full week plus of BAD migraines. Even after it stops, the migraines continue for a few more days at minimum.

  
I wake up at 3am with them now, the meds help marginally, a second dose sometimes kicks it. I never used to wake up with migraines or have them last over 24 hours. Now, it's my new normal. I WILL be reaching out to my doctors today but open to anything to ask about/for, advocating for myself.

\*sidenotes, I do have celiac so the McD fries and coke thing is off the table. I also suspect MCAS and some form of hypermobility issues. I have a lot of dental issues as well, even though I brush and floss, it doesn't make a difference. I also clench my teeth non stop in my sleep at the moment and wake up sore from that - yes I have custom night guards. Doesn't help.

It’s a low pulsing pain in the front RHS of my head (from my pov), that increases if I blow my nose?? 
They don’t start until after I’ve been up and about for a little while (2-4hrs), and by the time I realise it’s hitting I’m lying in bed, and I’ve been painfully napping them away until it reduces enough that I can get up and take pain killers. Caffeine also helps, and ice on the head. But they don’t do anything until the pain has already started to ease, so I can’t seem to get ahead of it. 

I’ve been on the same prescription drugs forever, but I’ve only been on 50mg pregabalin since about July, and stopped taking some antidepressants late October. Would this have any effect? 25F if relevant. 

The weather here has been all over the place, but I’ve noticed all 6 are on hotter days. Even so, lying in the aircon didn’t make it go away so I’m not sure that’s a contributor.

About 2 months ago I woke up with a little tension headache which felt like sinuses. Was driving to work and my eyes twitched side to side really fast for like a second and immediately got this faint feeling which may have been made worse due to anxiety. Went home and slept but just had a lingering headache. Had the pressure feeling behind eyes for a week so took Amoxicillin for sinus infection which started to feel better after a few days but then came back. A few days after that I was prescribed Augmentin to try knocking out a sinus infection again and same result. Had this lingering tension feeling headache and floating feeling on and off. About a month ago started to notice a lot of cervical pain and discomfort which wasn’t sure if from being anxious or just due to poor posture. Went back to the Dr who advised my eardrums looked inflamed a bit so put me on Prednisone and Doxycycline. Seemed to help again for a few days but the steroid had me even more anxious and unable to sleep. Went to the ENT who did a nasal endoscopy and CT who advised sinuses looked good and referred me to PT & a Neurologist. Been doing PT around 3 weeks now and haven’t noticed a huge change. Neurology is booked out about 4 months so no news from them yet.

Curious if anyone else has had anything like this. Super bizarre cause I felt fine until that one day I got this dizzy feeling and headache and since then I constantly have this on and off lingering feeling of floating with tightness/achiness in neck and upper back with tension feeling headaches. No prior history of any issues before and my bloodwork came back good besides low Vitamin D which I’m on a supplement for. I’m under the impression it’s from my neck, but my neck wasn’t bothering me until about 3 weeks after the first feeling so I’m thinking the neck could be from being tense and anxious about this feeling. I’ve been attempting to manage the anxiety with my therapist and just allowing it to exist, but I also don’t believe anxiety is causing this floating feeling and headaches for months now as I don’t feel anymore anxious then I have throughout my life and I’ve been fine. Any insight or advice would be amazing!

TLDR; 2 months of floating feeling with neck pain and headaches. Interested in any similar stories.",1766957818.0,1,2,migraine,mental_physical
1py2x2l,Is this normal???,"Hi everyone. I’m honestly at a loss and wanted to reach out to people who really understand migraines.

I’ve been dealing with a migraine every single day for 55 days with no break. The pain fluctuates, but it has reached 10/10 at its worst, and even on the “better” days it’s still there.

In the last 8 weeks, I’ve had four hospital stays because the pain became unmanageable.

My migraines are not responding to medications. I’ve tried acute meds like Tylenol, ibuprofen, sumatriptan, and Benadryl, with little to no relief. I’m also on daily preventives, including atenolol and Topamax, plus a monthly Ajovy injection. I’ve recently started trying the Nerivio device as well.

I just wanted to ask: has anyone else experienced something like this?",1766957002.0,15,21,migraine,mental_physical

1py14ez,How do you know when your migraine relief regime is no longer helping?,"TL;DR what the title says. How would you know when your migraine medication was no longer helping? 

I posted within the past 12 hours and I realized my regime is very light and I am unclear on all the terms used. I’m sensitive to meds and also have medication anxiety. I’ve been dealing with migraines since high school and I’m 41.  

I have kept migraine amounts since 2021. Marking which days I have one. The numbers below are the averages —- added up the totals from each month divided by 12. So I guess monthly averages? I’m not sure. I am a little challenged. 

Here’s some stats:

2021 - I’m not sure what my regime was (possibly Botox) but I started Emgality in November. 6

2022 - 3

2023 - 2

2024 - started ajovy in July - 10

2025 - 11 months - 10

From my own observations I already know ajovy does not help as well as Emgality. Looking at years 2021 - 2024’s numbers  I am confused as to why I 

Stopped Emgality. 

But I do see on my notes I was having two months in a row of 17 - 21 migraines and having a lot of head pressure. 

Since starting ajovy I don’t have the head pressure ones but they’ve maybe moved to eye graines. Though I had eye graines before which is why I stoppped botox and started Emgality. 

This is all a bunch of background and probably tmi. 

I’m just wondering how you’d know whether or not a medication isn’t helping. My numbers make it look like maybe ajovy has lost its effectiveness. I guess there is one more injection to try try. I forget what they told me the last time because I really thought they’d conclude it’s not helping with the numbers I’d give them. 

I’ve also had multiple MRI’s because I have annual cancer survelliance in my head and neck and whole body. They’ve never shown anything migraine related and these would not be a symptom of the non traditional cancer that I have. ",1766952632.0,2,1,migraine,mental_physical

1pxzwk2,Anyone else’s convinced eyes are your main trigger but can’t find how to fix it ?,"I started to experience chronic migraines when I was 16. I experienced a lot of pain in the eyes every time and it was worse after class and computer work. I was in an everyday state of mild migraine, with pain in my eyes, neck, light sensitivity, nausea. The pain was almost always here, and would turn into bad attacks a few times per week. 

While I have had different glasses since I’m 16, and one gave me a significant relief for 2 years. It was only 0,25 on one eye and nothing on the other. It took 6 month of wearing it to experience relief. 

It stopped the constant daily pain, and during this time I only had migraines attack with a clear trigger. It also stopped the neck pain. 

This glasses were made by an optician that also worked on posture. He tested by body response to determine the right prescription. He worked all of his life on migraines but unfortunately passed away with his secrets. 

Migraines are back for one year now. Same daily pain, everyday state of migraine, neck pain. My eyes are painful and if I put them at rest, they start burning and tearing and it’s painful yet very relieving. 

I have now a new pair of glasses. +0,25 +0,5. My new optician diagnosed me with accommodative spasm and also a false myopia caused by the muscle. So I have 2 pairs of glasses now.

I still feel there is something going with my eyes. I’m trying to connect the dots. Any experience would be helpful!

1pxzkr7,Are CGRPs a problem to take longterm?,"I am relatively newish to this - I’m in my 30s, I’d had a few migraines before, and out of the blue suddenly went chronic and started getting migraines all day, every day. Had to go on medical leave. Saw a neuro, got prescribed Qulipta for preventative and Nurtec for abortive. Started taking the Qulipta after about 2 months of nonstop daily migraines and so far it… seems to be working? Could be wrong, Ive had a few rounds of 2-3 day stretches of somewhat milder pain before where I think I’m out of the woods and then I get punched in the brain with a really horrible one but I’m on a week straight now of nothing over a 5 on the 1-10 scale and and a few days of being a 3 or less. 

  
Anyway, personal background aside. My neuro mentioned that if this works, after a few months they’d like to try getting me off Qulipta and seeing if my brain will do okay with just Nurtec as an abortive, and that a few pain free months may reset the need for a preventative. I was literally having a migraine during our meeting so I didn’t do a great job of asking questions. Is there a reason that it’s not great to take a CGRP preventative longterm, other than resistance from insurance companies?

Short summary, my parents were to busy with their own struggles and fighting growing up, so I always felt like I needed to be the ""perfect"" child leading me to be quite anxious and alway swanting to be perfect. I am pretty sure that my little sister is a narcissist and she grew up bullying me and used me as her punching bag. My parents didn't really care too much and never punished her. I've cut contact down to her as low as possible, but since we are both at home right now, she keeps hurling insults at me, screams at me and even spat in my face the other day, as I keep blocking her from using me as her narcissistic supply. Of course, I've gotten sick now and my migraine attacks have been increased tremendously. Funnily enough, my sister studies medicine and even though I had to explain to her what a migraine actually is, she asked me if I thought about the cause being psychosomatic, which was a couple hours before she had a complete rage fit and spat in my face.

However I have in the last year had maybe 2 occasions where when I closed my eyes I saw what appeared to be flashing light. Almost strobe light like. Could not see it when my eyes were open but it was definitely visible with my eyes closed. Made me feel even more nauseous and sick. I looked up what an aura was on Google and it didnt say anything about flashing lights just talked about a sort of halo light around your vision and zig zags so I just sorta thought it was a fluke. Im on hormonal birthcontrol thats the ring insert and you are not supposed to take this if you experience an aura with migraines as it severely increases risk of stroke. Today I was doing research on the ring and listed in the product info it talked about not using if you get migraines with aurora (flashing lights or zig zags) this made me really scared as I have seen those flashing lights.

1pxs0l8,The horror of my life,"Hey all,
I recently discovered this subreddit, and right now I’m completely at my wit’s end. I’m looking for some kind of solution, while realizing that there probably isn’t a single, all-encompassing fix.
I’m a 31-year-old man and I’ve suffered from migraine my entire life. As a child, according to my parents, I would often be lying on the ground for no apparent reason. I remember learning the word “tired” from my mother, and realizing that I had learned to interpret my migraines as just being tired. Of course, it turned out to be migraine. It took years before it became clear what was really going on. Headaches were simply part of my life, and I didn’t know any different. I functioned well: good grades in elementary school, and I was an excellent goalkeeper in soccer.
After several visits to doctors and pediatricians, I was diagnosed with migraine. At the time, I still didn’t realize that all of my headaches were actually migraines. I worked with “levels”: only when the pain was really bad was I allowed to take medication. I was given three triptan sprays and that was supposed to be enough. Slowly but surely, I became resistant to other types of painkillers. Paracetamol, Excedrin, ibuprofen—nothing worked for me.
Years went by, and my headaches continued to have a huge impact on my life. Still, I managed to graduate high school at the highest level and remained very good at soccer. I might even have become a professional footballer.
After high school, my symptoms got worse and worse, and I had to quit two college programs early because of migraines. During that period, I had migraines at least three times a week. When I started working full-time in 2019, migraine became an even bigger problem. I couldn’t call in sick that often. Up to that point, I didn’t have access to enough triptans to manage the attacks. I went through the whole medical process again and was thoroughly examined. Diagnosis: frequent episodic migraine with 14 attacks per month. Fifteen is the cutoff for chronic migraine, which opens up new options for reimbursement of expensive treatments.
Through the pharmaceutical company, I was still able to start CGRP treatment. Before that, I had to stop all pain medication for two months. It was hell on earth. The CGRP treatment helped, but after five years it became unclear whether it was still effective, since I was still having 2–3 attacks per week. I decided to stop CGRP.
A few months later, I’m now at 20+ attacks per month. I’m desperate. I have a son, a full-time job, and a partner. I can’t be the person I want to be. I’ve had to give up so much in my life, and there are so many things I haven’t been able to do. It has set me back tremendously.
I’m at my breaking point. I cry. I’m sharing this because I think connecting with others who understand might really help. I’m willing to do anything to live a normal life",1766930422.0,31,32,migraine,mental_physical

I’m posting because I’m really struggling and could use some real experiences.

I got masseter Botox exactly 4 months ago (for TMJ). Since then, my smile has been seriously affected. It looks strained and painful when I smile, like I can’t fully pull my smile back or up the way I used to. The width of my smile and even my lips look reduced, and it just doesn’t feel natural anymore.
Before Botox, my smile was honestly my favorite feature — people used to compliment it all the time — and losing it has been emotionally really hard.
At this point, I’d say my smile is maybe 60–70% better than the worst phase, but it’s still not back to what it was, even after 4 months. That’s what’s worrying me.
So I wanted to ask:

• Did anyone else have their smile affected after masseter Botox?
• How long did it take for your smile to fully come back?
• Did it recover gradually, or suddenly?
• Is 4+ months still within a normal recovery window?

Any personal experiences, reassurance, or tips would honestly mean a lot.

1pxjhvk,"Interesting clinical trial, one of the migraine nerve stimulation devices has been shown to help with non-migraine pain","https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05730556

I started using this device called Nerivio recently, I saw this trial and it was interesting. Basically they tested if regular Nerivio use in migraine patients decreased the amount of pain the patients felt when getting botox injections. The results are pretty stark, IMHO (as a statistician)

In the group that got real stimulation treatment first and then sham, at baseline, their pre-procedure, during procedure and post procedure pain went 23.0 -> 52.5 -> 59.9. Then at week 12, after they had been using the device for 3 months, their pain pattern was 21.2 -> 37.2 -> 38.7... Compare this to the sham group where their baseline and then week 12 numbers looked like 32.9 -> 58.3 -> 62.0 and then 27.0 -> 60.7 -> 64.7.

They then swapped the groups (real stimulation group got sham, sham group got real stimulation) and direction swapped -- real group had less pain than the sham group.

Thought this might be interesting to those who have not only migraine but also are sensitive to other pains in general. Personally I have noticed it seems to reduce other bodily pains, but given that that's N=1 and unblinded, it's not great evidence.

They are testing their device in a fibromyalgia trial that's ongoing... If the results are good, it lends credence to the idea that REN could reduce central sensitization in general. It's pretty great honestly, a stimulator that goes on your arm and so you don' even have to worry about head discomfort.",1766900315.0,10,5,migraine,mental_physical

1pxe5p4,Working while trying to seek answers,"Working is getting increasingly hard to do while I’ve been seeking answers as to why I am having headaches and pain daily. I leave work nearly everyday in tears from the pain, I have severe anxiety that something is really wrong and sometimes I have panic attacks due to it. I’ve had headaches as early as I can remember, starting around age 4. I started getting migraines around 12. Being on birth control has helped cut them back from 5x a month to maybe 1 every couple months. For me I define my migraines as migraines because they follow a pattern (aura, severe headache, vomiting) the headaches have always been normal but in the past couple years have become more frequent where I’m having them everyday. My doctor has diagnosed me with chronic daily headaches and we’ve tried several medications, some did nothing one gave me severe side effects that sent me to the ER. The current medication I’ve tried helps the headaches somewhat but I’m left with severe neck pain, and head pressure. I was told to ask about a Chiari malformation and with the symptoms described it would make a lot of sense if this is what I’m dealing with. I have an appointment with my neurologist on Tuesday but I doubt I will get in for any scans that day or anytime soon. 

My question is those who have gone through the phase of seeking answers/ diagnosis’s how did you work? I feel guilty every time I have to ask off for an appointment or call in because I cannot handle working with the pain. I am not able to get FMLA as the company I work for has less than 50 employees. I’m constantly worried I will get fired and loose my health insurance. I just don’t know where to turn and it’s all a lot to deal with. ",1766884458.0,2,6,migraine,mental_physical

1pxar8k,"Best phone for no eye strain, eye pain and headaches","I excitedly opened my new Google Pixel 10 Pro XL today which arrived in the post. I currently have the Pixel 8 Pro and get on fine with it eye/head wise but I decided to upgrade. 

I transferred everything over and set it all up, and straight away when using the new phone I realised that it was hard to look at, causing eye strain, eye pain and making my chronic headache worse. The particular feeling of the symptoms are unique to when screens are the issue. The words seemed fuzzy, the screen looked like it was moving/shaking a bit, and it was very difficult to look at the screen.

I've adjusted settings etc this evening and still the 10 Pro XL is essentially unusable for me so unfortunately I'll have to send it back, even though I think the settings changes have made some difference. 

After some research online, I've come across the Honor Magic 7 Pro (and the Magic 8 Pro comes out in the UK in 2 weeks). This is an excellent quality Chinese brand phone who have apparently invested a lot of time and money into making their phones the best for eye strain and other such issues. 

Does anyone have any experience with the Honor Magic 7 or 8 Pro and it's ability to not cause or worsen headache related symptoms? Does it work well at being good for screen care?

Or, does anyone have other makes or models of phones which are also good for this issue? The OnePlus 13 also came up, as well as the more niche Vivo X200 Pro.",1766875190.0,0,5,migraine,mental_physical

1px434v,Qulipta AND Nurtec?,"I was finally able to get in to see a neurologist earlier this week, after waiting seven months. A little background: I started having migraines in college in 2004-2008, but the university health clinic brushed me off. When I graduated, got my own health insurance, and started seeing an “adult doctor” she started treating my migraines but I was only having them about two times a month. They started happening more frequently in 2019, about once or twice a week. My husband urged my to ask for a a new treatment in 2020. She had me try Imitrex, but when it wasn’t working, she increased my dose and I had an allergic reaction. So early in 2022 She switched me to Nurtec. Nurtec worked at onset of a migraine. It was great! About two years in, I started getting migraines nearly daily so she switched it to preventative. I was having four to five migraines a week. I would get migraines on my “non-Nurtec days” and it was so frustrating. She didn’t really feel comfortable doing more so she referred me to a neurologist.

My neurologist is very nice, she listened to me and asked a lot of background questions. She prescribed Qulipta and I *thought* she said take Qulipta daily as a preventative and keep the Nurtec as an onset medication. But my pharmacist said he “would be very surprised if she prescribed both as they are from the same class of medications”. I sent a MyChart message, which I hope she sees on Monday. But I could have sworn she said Qulipta daily and Nurtec as needed. Has anyone had a doctor prescribe the medication that way? 

She also gave me the option of an injectable or Qulipta and I said either one. So we’re starting with Qulipta. Luckily my insurance is paying for it! ",1766858316.0,2,10,migraine,mental_physical

1pwu2mf,Chronic Migraine is Traumatizing Me.,"I have been living with migraine, chronically, for about seven years now.  For the longest time it was one bad migraine attack every two weeks and a chronic daily pain ""on the side"".  Then, maybe two years ago, I noticed a change.

The migraines seemed to be more frequent - every ten days or more - and the daily pain was getting worse.  To this day I still do not know if it actually got worse or if I just got intolerant.  In my naivety I believed that over time I would learn to manage the condition and I would become callous to the hardships.  Absolutely the opposite has happened.

I think I have become traumatized by these experiences and I believe that trauma is making the feedback loop harder to break.  The chronic daily pain has worn me down and exhausted me and I am left feeling more disabled than I have any right to be.

Certain migraine attacks have been so bad that I cannot escape them.  It's like they have imprinted themselves onto my soul.  I still deeply remember one event four or so years ago where the cyclical vomiting and intense pain was torturing me.  I was heaving - violently - every 30 minutes or so all throughout the night (8-10 hours).  My partner was working night shift at the time and so I had only my cats to keep me company.  In my torment the light fixture above me seemed to be a spider, and my cat a denizen of the underworld guiding me to the devil.  This image that I had in my migraine/medication induced delusion still haunts me and some nights I still choose to sleep with a night light so when I am afraid I can simply open my eyes and prove the image is not real. There is no devil coming to get me.  There is no danger.

This is not the only one.  There are many really bad attacks that I cannot seem to release from my mind or body.  I am in a constant state of hypervigilance and thoughts of migraine and everything related to it consume my mind.

Having an ""unmanaged"" chronic migraine is like being tortured.  I cannot escape my body.  I cannot run away or leave (except via disassociation, which I am so thankful for). I cannot predict when an attack will occur or for how long it will last.  I never know what symptoms will be most problematic or if medications will be successful. I am in a constant state of uncertainty - unable to live a reasonable life.

Anyways, thanks for getting to the end of my story!  This condition can be so lonely and I have felt so much better reading through other peoples stories it only felt right to contribute so that somebody else might know that you are not alone and that other people respond this way too!",1766828801.0,47,18,migraine,mental_physical

After trying Emgality, Aimovig, Botox, and Qulipta (I’ve also tried anti depressants and beta blockers; I’m on nortriptyline rn), my dr approved me to try Vypeti. I was feeling really hopeful that it might work because I know it’s a newer treatment and one of the last options. I got my first infusion 2 weeks ago. Right after, I went 4 whole days without a migraine which is record breaking for me these days. But then suddenly I started getting them again and now it’s been 9 days in a row that I’ve had an attack. I also have vestibular symptoms and this week has been horrible. I’m feeling really disheartened because I really hoped this would work :( I’ve even had DHE infusions that did nothing.

This might be related but I’m 21F and I swear my migraines got worse when I had an iud placement a year ago. I finally decided it was time to get it removed to see if that would help.

1pwoeha,Any solutions? My husband has suffered horrible migraine for 12 years!!! Cervicogenic headaches,"Hi all, I’ll try my best to cut this short.

My husband had an accident 12 years ago , minor accident causing whiplash. His headaches started since then. He says either that or with the constant soccer injuries his had. 

I met him 4 years ago . And he was having headaches almost every day or every 2-3 days. It would become debilitating, we couldn’t go out. He was in his room , lights off, curtains closed, holding back tears. It was horrible to witness so often. 

Who he has seen which has not helped:

\- gp ( ultrasound, CT scans, blood workout)

\- chiro

\- physio

What he has tried 

\- massage ( sometimes short term relief)

\- acupuncture

\- wet cupping 

\- paracetamol : doesn’t work

\- anti inflammatory: doesn’t work anymore

\- codeine : potential 30-50% of the time works

\- oxy : works 50% of the time 

\- 3 different preventative ( I forgot the names but currently on toperimate, has helped for a few weeks now we are back to where we started). The preventative’s helped for a few weeks or few months then they worsen, we do increase dose every few weeks but his headaches are so resilient 

\- heat pack : no

\- cool pack. Works 20-% of the time

\- 

We have tried a lot more but I honestly can’t remember rn. 

His 32 years old. His whole youth has been migraine filled. 

We used chat gpt and mentioned all our symptoms and it seems to think it’s cervicogenic migraines. No other gp has diagnosed any migraines. 

We are trying to convince our gp to give referral for nuero and pain team for other treatments. I thought ampitriptyline but husband does not want to start that as it can cause weight gain -.-‘

1pwo5v6,back to square one kinda :/,"I've been in the absolute mental and GI pits due to Topamax and in the end am still stuck with a migraine on the back of my head where it's usually perched. I'm relieved my neurologist was fine with getting me off of it, but it does suck that this didn't end up working out and I'm just kind of back to not having an answer to why I'm getting migraines that don't really have a start, or stop or solution (since Riza and Sumatriptans both have given me adverse reactions).

This holiday's migraine has felt like 

* A face hugger attached to the back of my head
* A claw machine trying to grab my head with actual sharp talons and using actual force
* A collection of ice climbers wacking their way up to my cranium with their pickaxes

My migraines in general I describe as feeling like my head is being hit with pickaxes, like someone's mining for ore from my head. They'll get felt in my ears sometimes, sometimes behind my eyes but always in the back of my head and sometimes on top. I've been to an ophthalmologist who (ironically) did exams and tests, then claimed they could no longer see me due to them not accepting my work insurance (even though I have Medicaid and never had any issues prior until it was time for me to get my results). 

I'm a bit bummed but not too sad? I'm relieved that I finally feel heard and that hopefully I can start to feel like myself again mentally and regain my appetite and relationship with food again soon. ",1766808124.0,1,0,migraine,mental_physical

1pwecjo,Instant rebound from abortives?,"Background: 54YO F, My migraine root cause is ON/cervical degeneration. I have had multiple rounds of prolotherapy over the past couple years and a nerve block and doing PT. It was all helping, but I would still get periodic migraines and would take an abortive. Have had rebound headaches from taking triptans more than 2 days in a row but not with Ubrelvy (as advertised). Had a migraine cycle in August after my nerve block wore off so started taking nortriptyline as a preventative  - worked great, maybe had two  but with very obvious triggers like having a cocktail in the evening. Then found a new type of PT (PRI) which has pretty much reduced my remaining neck issues altogether.  I didn’t like the side effects from nortriptyline (increased HR/constipation) and I have been doing so well that I thought I would try to wean myself off of it. I only ever took 10mg daily - it seemed to be enough to prevent the migraines and deal with minimum side effects. I went to every other day nortriptyline a couple weeks ago.

Issues: Then Sunday I woke up with a migraine early, so I took a Triptan around 5 AM and went back to bed. Head was still really sore when I woke up so I took a Ubrelvy- it subsided a few hours later. could identify a trigger for this one… Had a little alcohol later in the evening  and wore my glasses more that day, which can be a trigger for me.

Then felt migraine again overnight, but didn’t get out of bed to take anything until Monday morning. By then, it was probably the worst migraine I’ve had - also very nauseous. Took a ubrelvy with water (since it’s not supposed to cause rebounds and should be able to take max of two within an 24  hour period) and back to daily nortriptyline but threw them up within five minutes. I assumed that nothing stuck so I took them again.  Improved enough to function within a few hours, but had dull headache all day.

I am now on day six of a migraine cycle. I have been alternating Ubrelvy and Triptans and taking Nortryptline daily. But the migraines come on at the same time every day between 3 and 5 AM and the only thing I can think for a cause are the abortives themselves - no other obvious triggers since the first one on Sunday. It’s the holidays and we’ve had plans so I haven’t been able to risk not taking something but plan to do that tomorrow and just deal with it assuming I will wake up with another one at this point.

The prodrome happened over a few weeks ago, neck pain, stiffness, pain in the muscles on the side of my head and problems falling and staying asleep. 

On Sunday morning while out with friends, I noticed a sudden developing of a prominent blind spot in my vision consistent with an aura. I was pretty drunk at the time but just got myself to bed. 

The next morning when I woke the visual symptoms were persistent. But I’d developed a huge headache as well. This persisted throughout the next day. 

Because of the prolonged visual disturbances, I called the emergency services, who referred me to the hospital in the uk. Where I went and had some small tests done. Nothing. Two days later and the visual disturbance was still there, although somewhat better. I went back to the hospital who did a retina scan and a field of vision test. Both were fine.

It’s now 2 days past that and I still have the visual disturbance, which just looks like a blurry spot in my peripheral vision. As if someone has shone a torch in my eyes. With no other symptoms.

Recently a bit of nausea as well. Noise+light sensitivity even longer than that and just an overall feeling of wrongness. Had a hellishly stressful week prior. When I first noticed it I actually thought I was beginning to have a migraine but the pain never came and I managed to get myself to fall asleep. Thought it would fix itself by morning. 

Since then I've been to an ENT (the most pronounced symptoms at that point concerned hearing), hearing tests were all within or slightly above the norm, and I got told that it may be some post infection inflammation but there were no obvious signs. I just can't help but suspect it's code for ""something must be causing it but I'm not seeing much."" Besides, it just doesn't account for all the other things on top of the ringing.

Hi fellow migraine sufferers, I'm going through something right now that has  me pretty freaked out. I will say I'm not here seeking medical advice and I did go to the ER today, but I left without any solid answers so I'm just looking to see if anyone else has gone through something similar. 


I've gotten migraines many times over the years, some with aura and some without. I'm learning now that my migraines present differently almost every time, there are similarities but it seems like a new experience each time. I'm not sure if this is the case with anyone else. 


The one I'm having right now (I think?) is really different from others I've had. The headache phase felt different, more painful with different patterns located in one area and behind my eye. It caused toothaches this time around which was new, I didn't even know migraines could do that but I guess they could, lovely right? The headache finally began to subside a couple days ago, but it seems that I traded the headache for vision changes. I've never had this happen before, especially during postdrome and I know its not normal. It started out with just weird sensation in my eyes, like the sensation of taking off your glasses after wearing them all day or looking up after staring at a computer screen for too long. Like my eyes needed to adjust but they didn't have anything to adjust from if that makes sense? 


As of yesterday it had progressed to things at a distance being blurred and doubled, then this morning had progressed to double vision and burriness with everything unless its right in front of my face. Like I can type this just fine holding my phone right up in my face. If I look at something at a distance for too long the headache starts to come back. 


That's probably more info than necessary so I apologize but I'm honestly pretty scared. I went to the emergency room today, they did a CT scan and bloodwork and everything looked normal. The doctor said it could be a new presentation with my migraine but wasn't sure, she recommended i see my primary and an eye doctor but I'm just freaking out in the meantime. I hate using Google for these things and I know to take the results with a grain of salt, but according to that, vision changes during postdrome are unusual but not impossible. But how unusual is unusual? So I'm turning to you guys to see if I should really pursue the possibility of this being migraine related. If this is something other people have experienced then I'll maybe be able to relax a little until I get an appointment with my primary and an eye doctor. 


Thank you if you've read this. I sought out this sub just for this because I'm so scared.😭 


***UPDATE***

So I was able to get in to see an eye doctor today, thankfully they were able to work me in! The bad/good news is they also didnt have any answers. My eyes look fine, the backs of my eyes look fine, it all looks okay from a medical standpoint. Which is good, but I'm still confused. 

The doctor says he expects it to clear up on it's own, but has me coming back on Monday to make sure nothing changes over the weekend. Have any of you seen that King of the Hill episode where Hank goes blind temporarily due to being traumatized? Funny example but it's what i thought of based on what the doc said. He asked me if I've been through any trauma recently and although I wouldnt say I've been through trauma, I've been dealing with immense stress from several different angles these past few months. One of you pointed out that it could be a migraine overlapping with another type of headache, which would make perfect sense if I had a tension headache from stress that overlapped the migraine. Another of you mentioned the brain just being too exhausted, which I also think makes perfect sense given what I've been dealing with lately and the migraine itself. The eye doctor said even though everything looked healthy, he could see that my eyes weren't able to focus and were ""all over the place"". So that's where I'm at right now. 


Thank you so much for your comments. I know there weren't many of you but I wanted to share the update in case anyone was interested. I genuinely appreciate the time each of you took to read and respond with your thoughts and your experiences. I can update on Monday too if any of you want me to but for now I'm just going with the theory that my brain has just been handling too much lately and the migraine/possible headache overlap was the tipping point. I hope you all had a wonderful holiday and you all enjoy your weekend! 💜 ",1766738370.0,5,18,migraine,mental_physical
1pvywup,Medication overuse with chronic pain AND allergy to NSAIDS,"Hi,

I’m in a pickle!

I’m a chronic illness girlie so am on and off pain relief meds to manage that.

I’ve been working on getting that wayyyyyy down low since having a 3 month long SEVERE medication overuse migraine that ended me in the ER 3 times.

They finally figured out what it was and gave me an occipital nerve block but as of today it’s come back like a bitch.

I’ve just started on steroids and hoping they do something.

I’m not doing to touch the triptains or the opioids (although I feel like my eyes might pop out if I don’t!!!!). I’m using ice to help the pain.

The thing is I’m allergic to all NAIDS.

What else can I do until I get onto my neurologist ($500++) in the new year?!

Going to hospital doesn’t help! They give me opioids and a drip that didn’t do shit the last 2 times I was there!

I want to make it better today but not make it worse for the long run!",1766735624.0,4,11,migraine,mental_physical

Finally was able to talk to a neurologist and I’m scheduled for an MRI soon. Good news is she put me on Amitryptaline and I’ve only used it for 3 nights now. I can say a few things to start. Yes it makes me a bit drowsy at my dose (10mg), but my migraine severity has been reduced drastically. My body pains from the migraine spreading has also reduced and my headaches don’t turn into full blow migraines anymore. I drank two cups of coffee today and usually I drink only tea because of the risk of migraines. I even had some sweets which are my usual triggers. I feel great. I’m much more calmer now, feel happier, and my pain is significantly reduced. Alongside my medication I was also given Zofran for nausea and Rizatriptan for emergency.

 I do feel drowsy especially at night which does suck but honestly I rather deal with this drowsiness then horrible migraines which make it scary for me to even go out and enjoy myself because of the risk of migraines. Pain is not gone entirely but omg I can’t tell you how happy I am that currently I’m 80% better. I feel like I can finally enjoy life.

1pvt0xw,Venting and need advice on my neurologist,"I’m sorry for the long post. But it’s a frustrating situation for me and I can’t just switch neurologist.. Btw. she is a specialist in headaches and not just a “regular” neurologist..

I’ve struggled with condescending and negligent comments throughout it all. The last time she told me that my headaches and migraines are all from built up tension due to being nervous and anxious. And that a psychologist will make it better. Bare in mind nothing works on my pain. I’m suicidal due to my headpain (nervepain and muscle pain) and migraines. I’ve tried therapy. I have several pain conditions which is more plausible to be causing my built up tension. I’ve had migraines since I was 10 and other people in my family have it too. Migraines are unfortunately just part of me. Therefore not just solved with therapy. She kept on saying this in different ways for 15 minutes, and I acknowledged there might be a psychological aspect if I tense up when stressed as everyone else. But otherwise not.

I hate when I get told it’s psychological when I can clearly feel it’s not.

Then she said that migraines aren’t genetic at all. No gene has been found that shows migraines are genetic. If I looked at the posture of the people in my family with migraines then it was that. Nothing genetic. This applied to all - that migraines aren’t genetic.

Then I sat with shaky legs as I do often. She said “see as I said you’re nervous”. I said no I’m doing this even when relaxing at home. I’m getting evaluated for ADHD and this is one of the reasons why. She said that everyone got the diagnosis and that it wasn’t really a thing. She suggested a multivitamin which contained something that helped with the ADHD.

This was just from my latest appointment. You can’t discuss with her, as she ofc always thinks she’s right. Or says that you can’t be helped. Like talking to a wall. It’s so awful.

1pvmggp,I'm struggling with fear due to aura migraine after a previous stroke,"I’m struggling a lot with acephalgic (aura-only) migraine and I’m hoping to connect with others who have been through something similar. My first aura was at 20 (I’m 42 now). Over time they became more frequent and severe. At one point I suddenly lost vision in the right half of my visual field, and later that same week I had a stroke. I spent a month in a special care unit and a year in rehab. I lost coordination on my left side at first, but recovered to about 80%. Mentally it was hard, but after about a year I found a positive outlook again. After the stroke, the auras disappeared.

About eight years later they returned with a strange, terrifying feeling like something was seriously wrong. It passed after about 20 minutes and the hospital diagnosed it as migraine. For the next decade I had an attack maybe every two years, usually with mild headache afterward.
This year has been completely different. Since December 10 I’ve had symptoms almost daily: auras, flashes, light and sound sensitivity, fatigue, and hyperarousal. One evening I lost the right half of my vision for more than two hours. The hospital still says it’s migraine and not a stroke risk. A specialist migraine clinic has now prescribed Lamotrigine, and I hope it helps.

Emotionally it’s very tough. The attacks feel so similar to my stroke that it triggers a lot of fear. I had EMDR years ago for mild PTSD, but this feels like another level. I’m really struggling to cope and I’m unsure how much I should simply trust that it’s “just migraine.” If anyone has gone through something similar, I’d really appreciate hearing your experience.

1pvky4j,im not sure what to do about my migraines,"hello. i get occasional migraines a couple times a month and will usually go away when i take eletriptan. ive tried taking birth control for a year now and it hasn't gotten rid of my suspected hormonal migraines. then i tried a progesterone-only pill but it hasn't really gotten rid of my migraines. i had one recently when my spotting started after taking the new birth control for a little over a month. 

i recently travelled out of country and had a few migraines which i suspect are from stress or anxiety rather than hormones.

im kind of lost on what to do. i figured i'd just talk to my doctor when my insurance issue gets resolved and just rely on eletriptan for now. i did notice that i will occasionally get light / screen sensitivity on some days, and other days i'm completely okay with staring at a screen for hours.

should i try getting blue light glasses or glasses that protect against screen lights? i just don't really know how else to minimize my headaches/migraines.

when i get triggered by screens, i get a weird sensation in my head and my usual stabbing poking pain on my right temple starts. its like on and off every 10-20 seconds.

i also feel like i rely too much on eletriptan and would like to use it a lot less than i already do. i think i took 5 eletriptan tablets just this month and i feel like my excessive screen time and whatever else (hormones?) is triggering my migraines more than it should.

i also got nervous about stroke risk so im just kinda panicking. i dont even know if this is a hormonal issue or something. i didn't look at a lot of screens on my vacation since i went out a lot and looked at mountains and such, so im just lost.",1766691313.0,3,4,migraine,mental_physical
1pvkhw8,What might have worked for me,"Hey guys. Someone a while back said they think there are like 5 different types of migraineurs on here. So, I am convinced my idea will not work for everybody but I thought I'd share in case it helps somebody. 

I've been getting migraines, basically chronic, for about 8 years. I have been on two SSRI'S, Qulipta, Nurtec, etc. I usually run out of triptans. I usually get a migraine around 29 days in the month.

Anyway, a few days ago I took a Claritin because my eye was red again in the morning. Long story short, I have barely been getting any migraines in the past few days as I have been taking it daily. 

I know it won't work for everybody but maybe it will work for someone. I'll try to follow-up in about a month to let you know if it is still working.

Approx 3 weeks ago she started a headache that never went away. It’s always there, often just dull in the background. Involves her entire head, not just one side. 

However she will get horrible attacks where the pain is unbearable. These will usually last maybe 1-2 hours. They’re often triggered by car rides, smells, noise etc. This happens several times a day and is extremely painful to the point where she is in tears. The doc is thinking migraines however the dull headache NEVER goes away, it’s always there. Now she also started having numbness in her arms and feet which is getting more frequent and worse. From my understanding, numbness caused by migraines is usually limited to one side? 

So I’m curious if anyone else has migraines with numbness on all limbs (not necessarily all 4 at the same time) and a headache that NEVER goes away. ",1766603423.0,4,17,migraine,mental_physical

1putovv,During a migraine I had 2 seizures on Sunday. No memory of it,"So I was on day 4 of a migraine Sunday afternoon when it triggered my vagus nerve and I was spending time in the bathroom in case I ended up puking which I didn't. I'm not sure how long I was sitting there but that was my last memory. 

When I became aware again I was laying in a hospital bed hooked up to ivs with no memory of how I got there. By this time it was Monday when I become aware again.

My husband told me he had brought the kids up to shower while I was in the bathroom and had gone back downstairs after. They heard a couple bangs and when he came to check I wad on the floor shaking. The kids were sent next door to my BIL and the squad was called. 

In the er I had a couple cat scans that I don't remember. But I do remember being taken down to get and mri then later an eeg. One of the scariest things to happen to me. I hate that I don't remember any of it.

I'm home now and on anti seizure meds. Will be having a neuro appointment in January. I feel so unsettled.",1766600179.0,7,4,migraine,mental_physical
1putor2,Longtime migraine sufferers: How do you handle people who dismiss your condition or frequently make nonsensical recommendations?,"I am not asking friends, coworkers, or family, I mean health care providers.  I ask because the “have you tried yoga” or “ I, too, get bad headaches and aspirin helps me” or “have you eaten” are all too common for the regular folk to utter, but what do you when the nonsense comes from healthcare providers?

Context: On top of migraines, I have been hit with the dreaded perimenaupause frozen shoulder issue, and I have been dealing with it since May this year. I was misdiagnosed by two healthcare professionals, and ended up receiving a subacromial cortisone injection from a reumatologist at one point prior to seeing the current shoulder specialist, but I had a very difficult experience with the rheumatologist. 

Here’s the thing: I have a phobia of needles. And I became more scared of them after receiving botox for migraines and the monthly Aimovig and Emgality injections I used to take a few years ago. My husband had to do them for me, and I nearly had a panic attack each time. It was hard. The lead up to it, the needle pain, and the aftermath (side effects, etc.) 
Today (yup, Xmas Eve), I had a follow-up appointment with the shoulder specialist to determine next steps (eg, more pt, need for surgery or not, etc), and the “opportunity” for another cortisone injection was brought up. I had already shared my experience with the rheumatologist with this doctor and he said that he was not surprised “because reumatologists suck” — this shoulder specialist seems to have no filter as you will see — but I mentioned, I think as long as you walk me through, and as long as this “opportunity” helps towards progress along with more PT and helps me avoid surgery, I am willing to try again, but I mentioned, emphatically — I have a phobia of needles and reshared the rheumatologist experience and added the botox for migraine experience, which was also nightmarish for me, to which he mockingly looked at my husband and with an eye roll did air quotes and said “migraines”. My husband, sat there, and said nothing - not a thing. I was stunned, like wtf. I called my husband out later and it’s a whole thing not for this post, but for real? 

Anyway, this doctor mocked me in front of my husband as I was trying to share context regarding my health background while I was also trying to understand the next steps for my shoulder treatment plan. In the meantime, I was being mocked by how I have struggled to get help for another condition which involved receiving dozens of injections to head, neck AND shoulder — NOT for cosmetic reasons. 

This was bizarre and upsetting to say the least. Migraines are already hard enough, and on top of that I am struggling to get help for my shoulder, so I can’t even gauge pain levels anymore because it’s all mixed, so I was like in my head “this seems inappropriate and awkward, but do an outward hehe cause ya know, he is the doctor” so I said “alright let’s do the injection then”. 

So I ask, would anybody have thoughts, tips, or ideas on how I can handle this a bit better next time? I see this same filter-free doctor in six weeks, and honestly, I am getting too old to play nice. I will call the behavior out — whether directly or through a complaint if needed. 

Happy holidays and be well, all!

1pus02g,"Sudden increase in migraines accompanied by vertigo and severe nausea, which is unusual for me. Made some med changes a few weeks ago","I feel like anything unusual would warrant a call to my neurologist, my medical anxiety is up from this and this just doesn’t feel normal. I went up in dose of Strattera two weeks ago and that *seemed* to trigger a status migraine as I had one that lasted for 5 days (and actually it really hasn’t gone away, just wavers in severity now). I immediately went back down to what I was on before and it got better for a few days but then it came back, and I feel like it hasn’t left. I’ve had a migraine nearly every day since then and it’s accompanied by severe nausea which I usually don’t have, and now I’ve developed really bad vertigo when I go to lay down and get up with it. None of my abortive meds are working and I even got a migraine infusion that did barely anything. Now I did also go up on zonisamide the same day as the strattera, but thats a migraine preventative so you’d think it wouldn’t *cause* migraines, but maybe theres a weird opposite effect it can have in some people if the dose is too high or something (even though I’m only on 150mg up from 100mg). I’m still on the higher dose so maybe it is the zonisamide. Usually the winter isn’t great for my migraines but it’s never been this bad. But what’s more concerning is that I’ve been having more pain localized to the right side of my head toward the front occasionally like an intense throbbing pain in that one spot (though my entire head hurts all the time) and I feel like I’ve had really bad brain fog to the point of confusion at times so I wonder if I should get a scan. I’m only 22 so a stroke or tumor or anything like that would be wild but I do feel like my symptoms aren’t normal. But I also do have a history of IIH so I wonder if that’s getting worse? But the headaches usually get better laying down and worse standing up which doesn’t indicate that they are pressure headaches and my eyes looked great less than a month ago.

1pupfax,"Constant headaches, need advice","I have always gotten headaches. Actually, one of my earliest memories is a horrible episode I had when I was 6. My mom and grandma (mom’s mom) have always had debilitating migraines, so I have always assumed I’m just coded for it. 

I’ve only started paying attention to my headaches in the past year or so, because I’m pretty sure my pattern changed (though it’s hard to be sure because, like I said, I wasn’t paying attention before). From last winter through mid-summer of this year, I would wake up with a tension headache almost every morning. Every few weeks I’d go into remission and have almost no tension at all, and from late summer to the end of fall, I wasn’t really getting headaches at all. 

I have tried all sorts of remedies since then. I changed my mattress topper and pillow, tried different kinds of magnesium, started sleeping on my back rather than my stomach, among other things. My mileage has varied with all of these. I went to the doctor a few times and they gave me some prescriptions to try. The first one, propranolol, not only didn’t help but actually made my headaches worse, and gave me overwhelming fatigue. They also had me try sumatriptan, which does work but only if I have a full blown nausea migraine, and when I take it, I have to stack the sumatriptan with Motrin or I get the horrible tight glove feeling. 

The other day, I started using saline mist to rinse/moisturize my nose and that seemed to help for a few days. The day I started using it, I had woken up with a whopper of a headache but eating and using the saline mist knocked it out in under 2 hrs.  I used it again before bed and the next morning, I didn’t have any tension at all. That excited me a lot and for a few days I was really hoping I’d found my silver bullet, but these past two days I’ve been waking up with mild tension again despite using the saline mist. 

Anyways, it’s winter again, and my headaches have spiked with the season. Here’s my symptom profile, plus peripheral details that might be relevant:

\- I’m young (under 24) 

\- I have very big sinuses (discovered by dentist during facial xray)

\- I live on the east coast

\- Some headaches seem at least marginally related to the weather, which swings back and forth a lot where I live

\- Headaches almost always go away with Tylenol or Motrin. Tylenol works better as far as I can tell

\- I exercise  

\- Headaches can gather on my forehead, lean to the left or right sides of my head, or hover around the back/base of my neck - or any combination of those options  

\- I get maybe one serious migraine a month; the rest usually feel like mild tension headaches 

\- I have a humidifier, but haven’t tried using it yet

\- Magnesium glycinate didn’t really help

Anyone with a similar profile? Any tips or words of encouragement? Probably gonna go back to the doctor soon. I swear if these headaches stopped the quality of my life would skyrocket. So tired of waking up to headaches. ",1766588759.0,7,5,migraine,mental_physical

1puou4s,I’m about to start a new job but I’m worried about migraine resurgence on my new preventative.,"For context, I’ve been in between jobs for several months now. The last one I had to quit because of seizures. I’m good now (I think), 6 months seizure-free and finally able to legally drive again, which means I buckled down on a job search. I found a place that‘s interested in hiring me and due to extenuating circumstances the start date is TBD, but expected to be mid-January. 

That said, I just got out on Qulipta a few months ago and it’s been working well with only a few migraines here and there and very tolerable compared to my near-daily brain implosion. This isn‘t my first preventative, there was one that worked before it, but it stopped every migraine triggered by anything except light and, for some reason, clocking into work too early. 🤨 In fact, it doesn’t seem to be \*waking\* up early that can trigger powerful migraines, but actually \*working\* early. And not even ridiculously early! Just a typical 8-ish, 9-ish morning and normal working hours. 

My last job was able to accommodate this by simply moving my shift from day to afternoon. It got rid of that trigger entirely and reduced migraine frequency by a \*ton\* (with the preventative). I’m very excited about this job but they won’t be able to move my shift and I’m concerned about migraines flaring up again even on a preventative that works.

Since they both pretty much do the same thing, would taking Nurtec right now make the aimovig less efficient? Like if Nurtec bound to the protein first, then the Aimovig wouldn’t have as many to bind to, but then the Nurtec will wear off and the Aimovig would be gone at that point?

1puccg3,Topiramate & Sinus Migraines,"G'day peeps!

I finally got in to see a neuro a couple of months ago after pretty much an early lifetime worth of migraines of one stripe or another since childhood.  
The kind of migraines I've been experiencing over the last decade or so I've come to characterise as 'sinus migraines' that come on, we think, as a result of being exposed to smells and scents and weather conditions etc - petrol, perfume, burnt toast or the bloody spag bol sauce that smells so good it gives me the urge to take a very long dive off a very short jetty, if I sniff it too much.

The reassuringly German neuro here in regional Vic has given me about 5 different scripts to work my way up through depending on side effects and whether I can tolerate them.  
Started with increasing the amitriptyline I was previously on thanks to an ENT - that was a no-go from the start. Ugh. Nope!  
Moved on to Topiramate 25mg working my way up to a total of 100mg that I'm on now.  
Got the tingly fingies and toes, got the lost words in the middle of sentences.  
Don't appear to have any real change in the major reduction in the big boi migraines.

The thing I that sparked the urge to post this though was that I appear to be in less generalised pain. I'm moving around freer than I was before. I'm thinking better, despite not remembering the word for 'drawers' as I was looking directly at my office cupboard the other day. Legit feel like my old self, smarter. Wittier. Kinda floating around in space a bit more, I guess.  
Like I can pull from parts of my brain that I haven't been able to access for ages.  
Sleeping better, I think. Bed feels less like it wants me dead. And less like I need even longer to feel rested - hell, feeling rested at all is great!

What, precisely, the hell is going on?

Is it really just a case that before I was in such a deep hole of pain and I didn't even realise it?  
Or is this topiramate stuff just doing funny things to my head?

And then I'm scared as hell of the notion that because this stuff isn't tackling the big boi migraines, I'll have to move on to the propranolol that's next on the list and leave this stuff behind. Potentially leaving all these nice side effects with it.

Anyone got some experience similar experience with this stuff?

1pubxvs,Migraine variant? Are you sure?,"Looking for some reassurance and education from this ultra-tough community.   
  
For over 20 years, I have been struggling with episodes of intense symptoms such as vertigo, difficulty speaking, strangled throat feeling, dropping sensation, sensitivity to light and sound (I feel it in my stomach), nausea, facial drooping and tingling, trembling, heart racing, sweating, excessive urination, and pre-syncope type sensations. After being treated unsuccessfully for panic disorder, I decided to switch doctors and look for a more physiological explanation.

My new doctor is referring me to a migraine specialist. I am so excited to have a new direction to explore, I was somewhat surprised, since some of my experience is very different from the people I know who suffer migraines. Some examples...

1. Most notably, I don't have a headache. My neck at the base of my skull usually hurts before and/or after, but it's not the incredible pain like migraine sufferers describe. More like a dull, pulsing ache. Annoying, even nauseating, but not debilitating. 

2. My symptoms come on FAST. Once triggered, my symptom cascade starts immediately. For example, the first signs of hunger, flashing lights or glare, pressure changes (even an elevator ride can do it, and every airplane ascent is instant hell), and the first sip of caffeine or alcohol will start the symptoms within minutes. I was always under the impression that migraines develop from triggers over the course of hours. 

3. Migraine suffers I know are completely incapacitated. For me, I want to MOVE. Sitting is almost unbearable, laying down helps some, but walking or even lightly jogging feels a bit more soothing, even though I feel like I'll pass out. This really doesn't seem to fit.

4. Caffeine is my #1 trigger. I thought caffeine helps people with migraine. Reading through this thread, it seems like sometimes too much caffeine is a trigger. However, even a sip of coffee can send me into misery.

5. Duration. Though sometimes I have days-long episodes, most of these episodes end after only 30 to 60 minutes. From the people I know, migraines last much longer than 30 minutes, like at least 4 hours.

6. Crying terminates it. I can't force it, but if I am so miserable that I have a good cry, this is literally the only thing that ends it other than time. This is also contrary to a lot of what I read, where crying is usually a major trigger.

7. I never throw up. But belching (which I do a lot of during an attack) brings momentary relief. Maybe related?

I will, of course, take my doctor's lead no matter what. I just want to know whether to get my hopes up that this explanation makes sense and I will find help soon.",1766542769.0,2,4,migraine,mental_physical
1pubwi2,Finally found a doc who gets it 🎉 after two docs who refused to do my accommodations form,"In the past year I've been pretty functional 80% of the time, and 20% of the time I would either be in vertigo, or in a low-threshold state where anything could trigger vertigo. Not great for my job which requires occasional in-person presence.

I asked my neurotologist to complete my disability accommodations form. Asked, and replied, ""we don't do accommodations forms."" OK no problem, I talked to my PCP who wanted me to request info from my neurotologist, and messaged them again. They literally repeated the same response word by word, ""we don't do accommodations forms."" At this point I knew I was being treated as a fool.

... So I went to my PCP (now ex-PCP, big f u and goodbye). She also refused to sign my form, and the reason was that ""your migraine care was not transferred to me."" She wanted to me to start establishing medical evidence, which means: \*everytime I have an episode, I need to book an appointment with her.\* Lady this is not how migraines work. I got so angry and frustrated because I felt like I had to prove to her that my disability was real and after 30 minutes of back and forth she still wouldn't believe me. It was humiliating.

Finally, today, I met Dr. Martin Ho (in the San Francisco Bay Area). He got it right away. He was asking all the right questions, and after hearing about what my past year was like and how active my symptoms are at the moment, he immediately proposed adding meds. When it came to the accmmodations form, it was literally so easy. I did not need to convince him or prove to him that my struggle was real. I did not have to spell it out the way I did with the ex-PCP. He gets it. I'm so relieved.

Needless to say I switched PCP right away and have been feeling pretty blessed today.

To all of you: I hope you find the care you need.",1766542654.0,24,1,migraine,mental_physical

I used to have about 7 migraines in 2 weeks then none for months, then another 7 odd in 2 weeks and so on. Until eventually one of those breaks made it to 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and now making it to over 2 years I had another a few days ago. Then another yesterday. I can't believe it, now I am doing everything in my power to make sure my Christmas isn't ruined by a migraine. I got a refresh of sumatriptan and propranolol, I have completely changed my diet after researching good foods for preventing migraines and foods that may trigger migraines. I have taken it to the extreme as I do not want to experience a third. I was referred to a neurologist in my first bout of migraines over 2 years ago but still on the list 🙄. I get quite bad migraines, aura at the start, being sick is common but not with every migraine and they usually last 7/8 hours, the next day is also heavily affected but I can at least get up and do things (whereas during a migraine I am unable to do anything but try to sleep).

1pu4t4j,Question about how long it's taking to see a provider.,"What is happening with specialist appointments—especially neurology—these days? I honestly can’t understand how we got to this point, so let me explain what I experienced.

I recently called a well-respected neurology department affiliated with Emory University here in Atlanta, GA, to schedule an appointment. I provided several neurologists’ names that I had gathered from recommendations in my local Atlanta Reddit community. Out of the three names I gave, not one had availability before January 2027.

I then asked the appointment coordinator if any neurologist had an earlier opening. She checked and told me there were no appointments available with any provider before 2027. I was baffled. This wasn’t the case three or four years ago—back then, most places could get you in within a few months. So, what changed? Has there been a surge in patients needing neurologists? 

Are others in different states seeing the same long wait times for neurology appointments in your regions? Do you guys have any tricks or suggestion to securing an appointment?

I have suffered from migraines since my teenage years and am now 45 years old. About two years ago, I began experiencing symptoms that I had not previously experienced with my migraines. Specifically, I feel pressure around my temples, as if the sides of my head are being squeezed. I have seen a neurologist who believes this is likely migraine-related; however, I have not responded to five different migraine medications and he suggested Botox. 

The pressure seems to correlate with stiffness in my neck—the more severe the neck stiffness, the stronger the pressure on the side of my head. Additionally, an MRI performed three years ago showed ""hydrocephalus"", which my doctor does not think it bares additional exploration.",1766523213.0,1,5,migraine,mental_physical

I did close an eye at a time at the effect was still there. This lasted a couple of minutes and then returned to normal. During this my speech was normal, and I had no cognitive issues. I also don't recall any changes in my motor function. About 10-15 mins after this, I got up and walked over to chat to someone and noticed I was struggling to recall certain words and felt like I had Brian fog. I started drinking loads of water and my symptoms all went except a dull headache at the back of my head and then the front. The headache lasted just over a day but the whole time was very mild and didn't prevent me from continuing my work that day and the day after. In fact I managed to work through the whole event.

For context, I believe I was very dehydrated and tired. The day before my wife was rushed to hospital with a heart issue and I remember I didnt drink anything the day of the event and didn't go to the toilet. The event happened in the evening.

I put the visual disturbance, brain fog and headache down to dehydration. But after retrospectively googling, I am concerned it may have been a migraine with aura or maybe even a TIA!  I had migraines till the age of 26 and then they stopped.

Has anyone had an experience like this?

Background: My optometrist recently retired so I went to see someone else at his practice who is younger and uses more advanced technology. I did an exam with a Meta Headquest that showed I have an eye alignment issue.

The doctor recommended neurolenses on top of my prescription and when I tried it, it looked like HD vision over already HD vision (just the prescription). He said it helps a lot and with migraines and eye strain, and a bunch of things because the eyes are having trouble just centering which even with glasses might put a lot of pressure on my brain. 

Problem: However, it seems the cost is extremely high (at USD 900, not covered by insurance). I called my husband and he talked me into buying them (it ends up being like $2.5 per day of wear). A quick search looks like a lot of people recommend it and I even saw some old posts on this reddit thread, but obviously would love to hear from users that have been using them for years. 

I have been on qulipta for a couple of months but the issue is that when I try to go down from 30mg to 10mg, I get all the horrible migraine symptoms and I can’t stand it.  I am sort of scared that when we eventually try to have kids, I will have to go off it and be miserable.

So I decided to try it and see how it goes but I was wondering if anyone has experience using them? I saw a bunch of old posts.

Looking for some help and suggestions. Thanks in advance. 



Here is my headache story:

M37, I get headaches about once a week. That's my average for last couple of years. They’re not very sharp or extremely disturbing, but every episode is depressing. My headaches build up in the afternoon. By evening, they’re there, and at night I have to take medicine. They go away with one Naxdom 250, which is half of the standard 500 mg dose most people take. I only take 250 mg. Without Naxdom, it doesn’t go away. My doctor says Naxdom is safe and I do not take it more than needed; once in a while is fine. Also the headaches go away in one tablet and there is no lingering the next morning as if it never occurred. 

One of the triggers is neck stiffness when I lie in bed and use a pillow for support. It seems to stress some nerves, and the next day I may get a headache. An empty stomach can also trigger it. These are the two main triggers.

These headaches are mostly on the right side, very occasionally on the left now. Initially when I started experiencing these, they used to be quite severe but it’s good that they are not so severe of painful recently. Also, once it’s built up, no matter what I try, it won’t go away. So I end up delaying the medication which I eventually have to take. Even sleeps don’t help, if it’s there. I have woken up with a more severe headache in late nights and then taken the medicine. 

Now I understand the why and how of this. I visited a couple of doctors months ago, and a cervical spasm was detected, which triggers the pain. I do not have a persistent neck or back pain issue. Also doctors don’t put it in a high-risk category, it still bothers me every now and then, and I feel sort of depressed when it happens - partly because I feel like it shouldn’t happen, and partly because it has persisted for the last 2–3 years. Sometimes it happens once a month, and sometimes once a week. If I take a lot of precautions, it can be once a month. 

In the afternoon, it never occurs to me that I’ll get it in the evening. It takes a good 3–4 hours to slowly build up, and by evening it’s fully there. I feel that if it can be checked before it kicks in fully, I won’t need to take the medicine.

It happens on the days I’m in the office. Work is not that stressful, and I don’t even have long sitting hours, but the headache still slowly builds up behind the scenes, uncontrollably. Also, it’s easy when I am home as an afternoon nap at home helps a lot. This headache never occurs if I take a short 1–2 hour nap in the afternoon. 

\-----------------------------

Thanks for reading this far. I have been quite stressed out due to the persistence of my headaches and need to get a solution for my sanity. I try to keep my routines disciplined but it still exists.  Is there some advice I can get? I think some physical exercises can help a bit too but not sure to what extent. I’m planning to meet a few more doctors and find the best solution possible, but the way I’ve been cautious, I don’t really think a lot can be done unless there is a bigger problem underneath.

1pty0l4,"Emaglity changed my life for the better, I’m worried about coming off of it to try for a baby (30F).","I have suffered from chronic migraines with a cluster pattern since I was 10 (I’m now 30F). I tried everything growing up, birth control, IUD, all the anti-depressant, anti seizure, blood pressure medications that moonlight as migraine meds, tried naturopathic remedies, changing my diet and exercise levels/modes, cut out all of my triggers completely, you name it. About 3 years ago I had a really really bad episode that lasted 3 days. I was vomiting repeatedly, fainting everytime I tried to get up to lean over the bed or walk to the bathroom, I could barely speak, and I had hit my head one too many times from fainting, and I finally gave up and asked my husband to take me to the ER. 

Luckily I was coherent enough to ask him to take me to the hospital where my neurologist works so the nurses could see my chart. They called my neurologist, she showed up, and said I think it’s time for you to try Emgality. I had previously said I didn’t want to try it because it was too new and I was afraid of the long term effects. For background, my dad suffers from cluster headaches and because migraine studies and migraine drugs are a fairly newish field, it always felt like he was a test subject and we’re now watching how those drugs have effected him later in life. He’s had several small strokes, is ageing faster than he should be, and it’s just hard to see. Now, I know that could just be a result of his condition and not the drugs themselves but I was always nervous about Emgality. 

Fast forward three years and I wish I had tried Emgality sooner. It has changed my life completely. I went from getting migraines 3-4 times a week to 3-4 times a month at most. They are much much more manageable, and my rescue medications actually work because I don’t have to use them as often. At this point, my quality of life has improved so much that I don’t even care what the long term effects could be. I care that I have a life NOW. 

Now that I’m 30, I’m happily married, and wanting to start a family, my OB said that I would need to come off of Emgality at least 3 months before I start trying, and I will not be able to use any rescue drugs once I am pregnant. And I’m terrified. I asked my neuro if there were any pregnancy safe alternatives and she said no, the only thing I could use would be tylenol. TYLENOL. 

So, for any women out there who have come off of their migraine drugs to conceive, how was it? Honestly. I need to prepare myself and my husband. ",1766506803.0,1,10,migraine,mental_physical
1ptxezg,Men with Chronic Daily Migraine,"Hello all fellow sufferers,

I suffered from ""chronic daily migraine"" since the age of 18(30M now). My migraines were constant and would manifest in the form of tension headaches, eye fatigue, jaw pain, and extreme sensitivity to light. I flew to the top neurologists in the US for infusion treatment and brain scans but none helped, they actually made the headache worse. Eventually gave up on trying to find a ""cure,"" as my neurologists suggested, and my brain began to shut down as time progressed. I stayed on Botox(minor short term help) and Emgality.

Fast forward to a month ago, I decided to finally go to a psychiatrist and after a lot of resistance from myself, I got diagnosed with pretty severe ADHD and Autism. I got prescribed Vyvanse and Adderall which had an immediate effect on my tension headaches, eye fatigue, jaw pain, and sensitivity to light. Treating the ADHD was treating my ""Migraine.""

In short, it turns out that my brain was unable to filter the world around me properly which was overloading my central nervous system which would lead to debilitating migraine like symptoms.

In detail: 
My brain was unable to process stimuli correctly due to extremely low levels of Dopamine and Norepinephrine(ADHD) which caused stress which caused tightening of the temporal muscle which caused mimicry of a migraine in the form of light sensitivity, eye fatigue and jaw pain. This created a never-ending trigeminal nerve feedback loop(the side of my head was tight and in pain but my body registered it as eye fatigue as they share the same nerve).

I am now at 50mg of Vyvanse and 15mg of Adderall/day and have recovered a lot of my life. I write this to help any other people out there who are currently suffering like I was. Understand that you are your only advocate and will need to be open to alternative diagnosis and treatments in order to get better, do not settle on not finding out the cause.

I also would not have figure this out without the help of an AI as I could not read/understand the medical studies done on these topics due to my ADHD/migraine like symptoms. 

I am extremely disappointed in the entire ""migraine""/neurology web of doctors and do not understand what the degrees and certifications on their walls are for. The best answer I received from a neurologist is that no one knows what a migraine is or why it is caused or how to treat the migraine itself. I do not know why seeing a psychiatrist is not the first step in migraine treatment when all of the ""migraine preventative drugs"" are drugs that treat mental illnesses(depression anxiety etc...). 

I fear many more people are accidently semi-treating their triggers with the wrong type of drugs in the name of ""migraine prevention"" when they should be treating their mental illness trigger to the migraine. I also fear that this info will get lost as every neuro I have talked to will not listen in detail as they are so set in their ways. They know what drugs to give you before they even see you, and then tell you to stop trying to find a cure. It is the commonality between every migraine neuro I have seen and that is a terrible system. 

Anyways, I hope this helps someone out there who has had a similar experience to me or gets picked up by an AI, ha.

EDIT: Also, over the past 12 years I have a lot of ""phantom pain"" issues. Pain in throat, sinuses and even lower on the body like calves and elbows. I could not move my elbow due to extreme pain and then after taking Adderall the pain disappeared. Pain from throat manifested a day after swimming but doctors checked and my throat was completely fine and pain in elbow and calves manifested a day after golfing. My brain was registering tiny tiny injuries as massive injuries

EDIT2: Also came across this study:

Recently ive started to have some dizziness. I had one bout of vertigo but now the dizziness just randomly starts. Its not bad enough that the room is spinning but I definitely feel a bit off and have to lay down. My heart rate is fine, it stays consistent during these episodes.

1ptmi74,Ubrelvy! Finally a medication that worked!,"Hi everyone, I recently got prescribed Ubrevly after seeing a neurologist for Migraines(always starts with aura in left eye) i usually get one once a week that would absolutely floor me into the ER with intense pain and mimic stroke like symptoms. I've tried so many medications like triptans ect- . The only thing that worked was percocet/morphine to combat the severe pain. But with the crackdown on painkillers my PCP was longer able to prescribe pain meds, it really made me feel hopeless and fearful on how I was gonna function.
But he did refer me to an amazing neurologist who prescribed me ubrelvy! 
IT WORKED GREAT! It took about an hour to kick in and it felt like I had a mild headache which is a blessing compared to how bad my migraines get. Then at the 2 hour mark, my migraine pain didn't progress and completely went away! 
It did make me a little off balance like a sleepy brain fog but I would take that over the extreme pain. 

Im very happy I actually have something to combat my severe migraine pain and am very grateful. If you are like me and have tried countless meds and haven't tried ubrevly. I would recommend giving it a try.

The issue I'm running into are that my symptoms are generally pretty mild and almost flu like (mild-to-moderate headache, some dizziness, nausea).  I've never experienced something where the symptoms are as bad as I've seen generally described; I've never found myself needing to hide in a quiet, dark room, and I've never had pain to the extreme like having a fire poker in your eye, ice pick to temples, etc.  My symptoms also seem to be fairly long-lasting (several days to a full week or more where it increases and decreases, and the episodes blend together).

As a result of this, I have a really hard time knowing if I'm actually having a migraine episode or something else, and it's hard to know when to take my triptans.

1pt36xd,migraines suddenly became chronic & treatment resistant,"
If your migraines suddenly became chronic or treatment-resistant, ask to have your iron checked

I had regular (episodic) migraines for years that were manageable with triptans. Then fairly suddenly, they became chronic — more frequent, harder to break, and my usual meds barely worked. It felt like my migraines randomly became “treatment-resistant.”

What no doctor checked during that shift: IRON.

When it was finally tested, my serum iron was low and TSAT was borderline low, even though hemoglobin and ferritin were technically “normal.” Because I wasn’t anemic on paper, it was brushed off — but you can have functional iron deficiency that still causes symptoms.

Around the same time my migraines worsened, I also had:
	•	Constant fatigue and weakness especially on one side of my head
	•	Brain fog
	•	Low energy
	•	Migraine abortives suddenly not working

Iron plays a role in oxygen delivery and neurotransmitters, and low iron can make medications feel ineffective. Addressing the iron deficiency didn’t magically cure my migraines, but it explained why things changed so abruptly.

If your migraines recently became chronic or your meds stopped working for no clear reason, push to have iron, TSAT, and ferritin checked — not just a CBC. Especially if you’re being told your labs are “normal” but your body says otherwise.

Posting this because I wish someone had told me sooner.

Tldr: Get iron levels checked, if you are low on iron and still not anemic it could still be largely contributing to symptoms. taking iron supplements i started noticing a difference in a week!!!",1766419280.0,15,3,migraine,mental_physical

As I'm sure is the same for many, I've never been able to look at any sort of screens when I have a migraine (i.e. no TV, computer or iPhone etc), but could normally (apart from the worst migraines) at least read my book, or very quietly listen to something like a podcast/audiobook. But lately I can't do these either.

I also can't do anything that involves much movement, because as soon as my heart rate increases even slightly the head begins to pound. So walking/doing jobs etc is out.

And most of the time I'm not someone who manages to sleep them off. I'm an average sleeper at night, but can never day nap even when I have a migraine.

So the result is that lately when I have a migraine I'm just spending hours and hours sitting on my sofa in a dark room staring at the walls. I can't find anything to occupy me, and so the mind goes wild and inevitably the thoughts can get a bit much.

1pt0lry,I’m so tired of not being taken seriously,"I’m 25 and I have chronic migraines. Before I started taking prevention meds, I’ve had episodes for 15-20 days in the month.

I have a really bad past when it comes to not being treated seriously. I was a really good student up to my puberty, when I started getting migraines - I started skipping most school days because of pain. Still got straight A’s but was called lazy everyday. Heard that I’m just pretending and was forced to go to school where it was sensory hell. My mom started treating my migraines seriously only when she got one herself, when I was like 20. 

Because of that I get really reaaaally upset when people do not treat my pain seriously. Now I have maybe 1-5 episodes per month, but recently I’ve had one that went on for 2 weeks with maybe a few hours without pain in between some days. 

My gf came over (she lives with her parents) and wanted me to measure myself so I could order a kimono for brazilian jiu jitsu which became her hyperfixation (she’s audhd) so we can go together. I let her know that I know she’s excited but I’ll do it when my migraine gets a little bit better. She said it’s okay. She asked again after 20 minutes, so I repeated myself. After another 20-30 minutes she asked again and said “you’ll forget to do it later” so I angrily stormed off without a word and started looking for the measuring tape - which I didn’t know where it was as I’ve freshly moved - and like 30 seconds into me searching she said to just leave it. I said that I just want to get it over with and kept looking. Searching through the boxes and all over the apartment was exhausting and painful because there was just so much stuff making noise. She left angrily, just throwing “bye”.

She got really upset and mad at me for making her feel bad about the only thing that she was excited about in recent months and that because of me she’s not happy for it anymore. Said that if she knew I’d have to look for the tape then she wouldn’t have asked so much. And I know I should’ve just mentioned it, as it was only obvious in my head, but I really wasn’t thinking much as I’ve had a really bad episode. But I don’t get why my need couldn’t be respected even without that. And I don’t get how else can I communicate so my need to just lay down can be treated seriously. I cried after she left because she just shrugged me off coldly and it just really brought up those bad memories. She gets annoyed with me often for not being able to do something when I have an episode even though they’re rare now. She used to complain at me very often to her friends for not being able to do stuff because of my migraines and grief induced depression (like idk I haven’t done dishes in my apartment for 5 days and I didn’t clean them up for when she comes over. she complained that i should be over my grieving stage 3 months after my only grandpa died. for all of that i’ve seen screenshots from a mutual friend.)

1psylnt,Migraine causing neurological issues,"5 years later, numbness, tingling, burning (at least 90% of each day) and complete loss of function of legs (at times) which is getting progressively worse and told ‘it’s just a migraine’. This is in addition to the aura and aphasia. I just want to feel normal again and not worry about not being able to walk when I’m in social settings. ",1766407216.0,4,14,migraine,mental_physical
1psyk4w,Temperature rises during migraine?,"Good morning. I hope.

my husband (39m) has a history of migraines and takes Relpax for them. He has been out of Relpax for two weeks now and yesterday around noon he started to get a headache. For a while it wasn’t horrible and took excedrin migraine but around 7pm it became bad. Severe nausea, etc.

I asked him if he was sick and he said no. So I told him to take his temperature just to be sure. It was 99.8 and he runs around 98.2-98-9 regularly.

He took his temperature several times last night and it was:

99.8

100.3

98.9

100.9

99.1

98.6

98.2

This morning it has held steady (since around 445am) at 98.0-98.6.

Curious if anyone else has seen this.

On a scale of 1-10 his migraine was a 7 last night. Today he says it’s around a 2. Nausea is gone and he’s exhausted from not getting much sleep due to the migraine last night.

Anyone else go through this?",1766407082.0,1,4,migraine,mental_physical
1psx55c,Something I never experienced before - a LOUD fire drill while waiting to see my neurologist.,"I typically see my neurologist every couple of months because the only thing that works for my migraines is opiates (not every migraine drug is available here). But today the hospital where my neurologist and pain specialist offices are located decided to have a fire drill while I was waiting to see the doctors (usually one right after the other, VERY SHORT visits). The drill included a very LOUD alarm with flashing lights, I think they got the message when I pulled out my noise cancelling headphones and an eye mask. Within minutes the nurse came over asked if I needed to see either doctor, which I typically don't 'need' to see them just refill my codeine pain killer and sumatriptan. About 90 seconds after her asking me she hands me my prescription and I'm out of there. But I was well on my way to a killer migraine. ",1766402318.0,24,25,migraine,mental_physical
1psupg9,Why does study/focus trigger migraines,"I have been suffering from migraines from my childhood, and I believe migraine has always been a hindrance in my study. Whenever I study with focus or put extra effort to understand something, the migraines trigger and the day is gone! Not sure why it happens but has anyone here experienced the same? Were you able to find something which can help?",1766392993.0,2,2,migraine,mental_physical
1psu5tx,I’ve had migraines for a month and my mom keeps blaming my lifestyle. I’m mentally exhausted.,"For the past month, I’ve been dealing with constant migraines. Some days it’s just a dull throbbing, other days it feels like someone is drilling inside my head. I’m genuinely trying to manage it  drinking water, taking breaks, trying to rest but nothing seems to help.
What makes it worse is my mom’s reaction. Instead of trying to understand what I’m going through, she keeps saying it’s my fault.
“Your lifestyle is bad.”
“You don’t wake up early.”
“You don’t do things on time.”
“You’re becoming a burden.”
Hearing that repeatedly while my head feels like it’s splitting apart is honestly draining. I already feel helpless because of the migraine, and her comments just add guilt and stress on top.
I don’t even know how to explain to her that migraines are not just ‘bad habits’. I feel like no matter what I do, she’ll blame me anyway.
I’m just tired. Mentally and physically. Dealing with pain is one thing, but dealing with pain and being told it’s your fault every day… it’s a different level of exhaustion.
I wish someone in my house would just understand what migraines feel like.",1766390842.0,512,54,migraine,mental_physical
1pstjrv,Getting my first botox session,"I'm getting my first session of botox for my migraines in 2 days. 

I'm a bit nervous,  what should I expect? 
I was thinking about using topical lidocaine on my skin to help with the pokes. Has anyone else done this?

I've had migraines for over 7 years, and nothing seemed to really help get rid of them. I do get relief from OTC meds, but it doesn't last all day. 

I was diagnosed with IIHT and my migraines got a lot better after I lost some weight, but they never went away. I think most of them are coming from tension in my neck, but i typically have them 20 days a month. 

My neurologist said I would be a great candidate for botox, so here I am. 
It seems like a lot of people have success, so I'm excited to see if this works. 

Off topic, but what are the chances my doctor would use the left over units for my crows feet/ face. 🤣 they're gonna discard the extra anyways right, lol.",1766388490.0,2,4,migraine,mental_physical
1pstd1p,Nurtec luck on larger health plans?,"Most Americans work for businesses with less than 500 employees (if not farrrrr less). The larger the company, the broader the health insurance options. (I’m speaking generally.) I once worked for a business with about 1,000 employees and I was able to get nurtec immediately, no issues, mayyyyyybe a higher copay of $40/month (fine). No step requirements before taking it.

I’m just curious if that was beginners luck or if larger companies have health insurance plans that can absorb the cost of newer, more expensive prescriptions. Assuming the business provides decent healthcare (and doesn’t screw with employees like Amazon, Walmart, etc.), anyone know if it’s easier to get these higher priced meds if you work at larger businesses?",1766387776.0,1,7,migraine,mental_physical
1psruhp,Took 2 years of ongoing issues but getting more tests,"I recently had an appointment with my doctor and gave a decent list of various things related to migraines and some I think are unrelated and he actually gave me paperwork. I've had the same chest pain on occasion, but frequently enough for concern, and I have ECG booked. Unfortunately that stuff didn't go away when I stopped nadolol so it's time for more tests. Also have blood work booked and should be getting a neck scan to check my nerves.

Please be polite but annoying to your doctor; somehow both are possible. I find that's the only way to get more than medications that might help. I'm also tired of side effects and remembering to take pills, along with the price of them when they don't always work.

Hopefully something comes back wrong from all the tests as aa actual solution would be so nice.",1766382386.0,3,2,migraine,mental_physical
1psqn83,Emgality Neck Pain!,"I took two doses of Emgality — one in April and one in May. Shortly after starting it, I developed severe neck pain that was unbearable and lasted for about three months. Because I was worried the Emgality was causing it, I stopped the medication in June, just before my third dose.

I ended up suffering through most of the summer with this neck pain. Eventually, I went to physical therapy, and it slowly improved. Thankfully, I no longer have that neck pain. 

I started having daily migraines again. At this point, I haven’t taken any migraine preventives since May, and I’m very hesitant to start Ajovy. I’m honestly terrified of the neck pain coming back — it was some of the worst pain I’ve ever experienced. I would much rather deal with migraines than go through that neck pain again.

I’m wondering:

* Has anyone else experienced neck pain with Emgality or Ajovy? ",1766378401.0,3,2,migraine,mental_physical
