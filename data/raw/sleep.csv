1qamxjt,Night sweats as a 26 years old,"Hello guys 

I have been searching through reddit about my issue to see if someone has experienced it but nothing to be found 

Some of the nights am waking up between 2-4 sweating ( I need to change clothes ,and lay something underneath otherwise I have it cold from the wetness) . 

I have tried everything,blood tests , thyroid check up because of my sweat , bought cotton sheets but nothing seems to work 

The funny thing is that when I go to my home country I don't experience any problems there

1qamb6h,"After 3 years in this apartment, in the past 6-7 months I haven’t been able to sleep here. Please advice!","I have been living in this apartment on a 7th floor for three years now. I’ve always slept fine and very restfully. Then, I went to visit my home country for two months, and when I came back here where I live, I couldn’t sleep anymore. This has also caused me to have an incredibly severe eczema that has worsen everything, as I not only don’t sleep, but also spend so much time scratching until early morning.

Lately, I went to an holiday for a week, and I slept super well, and even my skin got better. Then, when I came back here in the apartment, after 20-30 minutes, I started having a terrible allergy reaction, my skin got oozing, swollen and brutally itchy. I couldn’t stop scratching that night and I just didn’t sleep at all. The day after, I decided to go sleep at some hotel nearby. There, I slept incredibly well and skin was great.

  
So I thought: okay there must be some mold, bacteria, fungi or something like that in the apartment. So I hired a team of 8 people who came to disinfect and clean every single corner of my apartment. Then, I went back to sleep there and I really couldn’t sleep well, the sleep quality was very bad.

  
So here I am asking for advices. I am really desperate because I have always felt safe in this apartment. But recently there has been something really off and I really need to get back to my sleep. I have tried doing cleansing energy rituals, tidying the space up and everything. It still doesn’t work. ",1768195092.0,1,2,sleep,sleep
1qam37v,Stuggle to fix sleep cycle 😭,I somehow always find myself sleeping at 5 am. Tried using many sleep tracking apps but never found incentive to use it. I was always too lazy to fix it.

1qal246,"Guys, ever since I came to the Gulf, my overall situation has been really bad.","I did get a job, but the main problem is my hypersensitivity — because of other people’s snoring, I’m not able to sleep at all. In the first room, it was like a full-on snoring concert. Because I wasn’t sleeping properly, even during an interview they asked me if I hadn’t slept the previous night.

This is the third room since I arrived here. Before moving into the first room, I had already paid the money, so for one month I somehow managed to sleep by wearing headphones and playing loud sounds. But later, the side effects of that started to show up.

After one month, I shifted to another room, but I stayed there only for one week (that place was available only for that many days). During that week, I slept really well because no one there snored. After a week, I had to move out again.

Now I’ve moved into another room, and the same old problem has started again. Since I’ve already paid 900 for this place, I have to stay here for at least one month, no matter what.

I’ve tried using earplugs as well, but there was no change. The only thing that works is playing music at full volume, but staying like that the whole night messes up my head — by morning, my head feels completely messed up.

Mentally, I’m totally exhausted. I’m writing this post at 4 a.m. Even though I went to bed at 11 p.m., I still haven’t been able to sleep.

1qal1rb,No restful sleep for 10 years. Help!,"46M USA

I need help. 

I haven’t had restful sleep for about a decade. I’m “technically” sleeping at night, and my wife can attest that I’m a snorer, but multiple sleep studies have not found any sleep apnea. 

I go into REM sleep right away at bed time. My record so far is 4 minutes from when I start a timer, close my eyes, find myself sleeping, and purposefully wake myself up to check the timer. My dreams are either nightmares or excessive and relentless (“epic dreaming”). I dream like this nearly every time I sleep, day or night, whether it’s in bed at the end of the day or at my work desk on a 10-minute bathroom break.  

When I wake up in the morning, I never feel rested or refreshed. On days when I get an opportunity to take a nap, I crash and am dead to the world for 2 to 3 hours. 

I spend every waking moment of every day feeling like it’s 3am. The most peaceful I feel is when I’m able to lay down to sleep at the end of the day. 

I’ve been diagnosed with narcolepsy type 2, meaning I do not have cataplexy (sudden and temporary loss of muscle tone triggered by intense emotions like laughter, surprise, or anger). Type 2 narcolepsy is also called Excessive Daytime Sleepiness.  

I’m currently taking 250mg daily of armodafinil (Nuvigil) and 30mg daily of dextroamphetamine-amphetamine (Adderall) to promote awareness during non-sleeping times. When they kick in I don’t feel anymore rested - I still feel like I haven’t really slept in years - but I do experience an elevated heart rate, like I’m a car running on jet fuel fumes rather than merely on gasoline fumes. Like a reanimated corpse on crystal meth whose only wish is for the sweet release of… well, you get the idea. 

The doctors at the local sleep center can’t find anything to actually treat. There’s nothing showing up on a scan or in my bloodwork that raises any red flags. They just give me pills that help me have a few hours of useful consciousness a day.

But I’m sure you’ve all experienced this before, right? Any advice is appreciated. ",1768191300.0,1,0,sleep,sleep
1qak7wr,No more dreams please,"I (32F) have always dreamed like a lot since I can remember. Mostly very VERY weird dreams or nightmares. It’s not tie to what I watch or do during the day. I also suffer from insomnia, which worsens during high ovulation. The best night of sleep I had was 5 years ago when I tried recreational marijuana once for the first and only time in my life. I laughed like a maniac and slept like a baby. I woke up refreshed, which I never do. No matter how many hours of sleep I have.

I would love to try something that emulates how I slept that night, but without having to smoke marijuana. I have tried THC and CBD gummies, but is not the same. I even had one bad trip once on a small piece of gummy.

1qajl66,Como cure mi insomnio,"Hola espero que esten muy bien, este posteo va a ser un poco largo pero quiero describir con el mayor lujo de detalles como me cure del insomnio, quiero hacerlo porque realmente lo sufri mucho y realmente me genera mucho dolor y tristeza pensar pensar en la gente que a dia de hoy lo sufre y no ha encontrado una forma de curarlo.

Empiezo por el principio, en mi caso y gracias dios solo duro 1 mes y medio, pero nunca en mi vida habia sufrido una situacion de este tipo, comenzo un dia en que no pude dormir porque me pusieron nervioso los latidos de mi corazon que latia mas fuerte de lo normal sin ningun motivo aparente, esa noche no dormi, pase muy mal el dia, a la siguente denuevo lo mismo y todavia se sumo el miedo que me genero el no dormir y pasar mal, vivi el siguiente dia muy mal y cada vez mas asustado con la situacion, a la tercer noche logre dormir apenas 2 horas. Ya para ese tercer dia no entendia nada de lo que me sucedia y me tenia muy nerviso y asustado, me pedi licencia en mi trabajo, deje de entrenar, pasaba el dia tratando de entender buscando informacion de que me pasaba, no encontraba la informacion correcta y ademas leia testimonios terribles de personas con años de insomnio que apenas podian dormir unas horas por noche con el uso de pastillas lo cual yo me negaba a hacer. Asi pasaron los dias, no podia dormir cada vez estaba mas preocupado, deprimido asustado, sentia que mi vida ya no tenia sentido, no poder dormir es de las cosas mas espantosas y desesperantes que puede vivir un humano y solo lo entiende cuando lo vive, describo todo esto para que entiendan que pese a lo corto de la duracion del episodio de insomnio realmente me afecto mucho. Asi pasaron dos semanas, 2 dias sin dormir y al tercero lograba unas horas de sueño era espantoso. ACA lo que encontre que me ayudo muchsisimo y espero que les ayude a ustedes, sicologia conductual, gracias a libros de un autor, Santiago Santandreu se llama, descubri que la unica forma de superar el no dormir es superar el miedo a no dormir, que es lo que sucede uno tiene un episodio de no dormir por el motivo que sea y al asustarse y pensar que eso va a volver a suceder se activa el miedo en el cerebro lo cual no permite a uno dormir en el futuro, porque? porque el cuerpo ansioso y con miedo no puede dormir, es un mecanismo de defensa, ahora como superarlo? bueno la cuestion es que te tiene que no importar si dormis o no pero de verdad en el sentido de ""si duermo una hora hoy que asi sea, y sino duermo no duermo"" quitar todas las presiones, poco a poco haciendolo realmente el cuerpo se relaja y empieza a volver a dormir por si solo. Que pasa si no duermo? haces tu dia normal como si hubieras dormido, trabajas estudias entrenas, todo lo que ibas a hacer, de esa manera el cerebro y el cuerpo entienden que no dormir no te afecta en nada que no es problema y cada vez mas se libera de la presion de dormir, les aseguro que esto funciona deapoco vas volviendo a dormir normalmente, cada vez mas horas, aveces mas a veces menos pero no te importa encaras tu dia como sea, esta es la cura y es la verdad yo la vivi. Hay mas tips que les puedo decir y es el no entrar en la charla mental que les de su mente, me refiero a esos pensamientos de cuando vas a la cama como ""que pasa si hoy no duermo? o hoy me tome un cafe capaz me afecta el sueño"" todas esas charlas internas no les respondan solo dejenlas pasar, ni para pelear con ellas ni para avalarlas, es la mente que quiere generar ansiedad para entrar en la rosca de no poder dormir. Busquen los libros de Santiago Santandreu, tambien su canal de youtube, tiene el testimonio de una mujer que supero el insomnio de años haciendo estas cosas, el libro que lei de el se llama ""Sin Miedo"" realmente parece que le hago propaganda pero es que realmente fue uno de los pocos que me ayudo a entender todo este asunto del miedo y del estres post trauma que es lo que termina pasando cuando uno tiene miedo a no poder dormir, por otro lado otro canal de youtube que me ayudo fue ""the sleep couch"" son testimonios de personas que superaron el insomnio y tecnicas para superarlo.

Espero que todo esto le sea de ayuda a quien pueda necesitarlo, espero que quien vive la situacion espantosa de tener insomnio pueda curarse y no depender de pastillas ni de nada para poder dormir.

1qah7nm,Sleep during pregnancy sucks.. help!,"Now, I know I know - crappy sleep is normal during pregnancy. 

But I’ve had sleep issues (falling asleep around others) since I was a kid and nothing had worked but trazodone which I got a script for maybe 10 years ago now. Only taken as needed over those 10 years but it truly was the only thing that worked (NyQuil, hydroxyzine, melatonin, Benadryl, unisom, amitriptyline, you name it, it won’t make me fall asleep). Right now, all I take is Diclegis (unisom b6). 

That said, now that I’m pregnant (15wks), my sleep SUCKS. Like worse than ever since about week 5-6. Not only can I not fall asleep, but more importantly, I can’t STAY asleep. On average, my oura ring tracks me waking up roughly 10 times over the course of a night which I remember every time. Only 2 of those are usually linked to having to pee and eat a snack. On top of pregnancy exhaustion, now I’m also sleep deprived. I’ve tried going to bed at 8pm just to lie awake or be up in a few hours for several hours. 

My next OB appointment is next Monday, and the nurse I called last week basically told me that because I’m growing a new life it’s normal to be tired. Thanks, I know. I am honestly getting to my breaking point and don’t know what else to do. I know it’s only going to get worse once I can actually feel this kiddo punching and kicking me from the inside, but what can I do that’s pregnancy safe to try and get some sleep before my next OB appt?!

1qagbfn,Strange Sleep paralysis,"I’ve recently started experiencing these strange sleep dream things I am assuming is just sleep paralysis but I’m not sure anymore. I recently moved out of my parent’s house for school. With that I have started taking naps on my couch after achool. I have never had naps in my life before but I felt like I needed them. I don’t remember if it was the first one or when it first happened but it started right after I started taking these naps. So basically what happens is I get home, do some shit then lay down on my living room couch with the lights on and watch YouTube till I pass out (I’ll turn YouTube and anything else off before I fall asleep). After I pass out I start to have these incredibly realistic lucid dreams, 9 times out of 10 though I am driving my car in these dreams, after what feels like a couple minutes of driving whether it be on the highway or in town, I basically loose all cognitive function, my eyes cross and I feel myself starting to pass out behind the wheel, I don’t know how to describe the feeling but it’s almost like you are really fucking high after smoking weed (for the record cause it’s probably useful info the only drug I’ve ever tried is weed and I do it maybe twice a month when I’m drinking with buddies). After that I “wake up” laying on the couch in the position I fell asleep in, and this is now where the “sleep paralysis” comes in. I will wake up and only be able to be looking ahead forward. I can move kinda but it’s like my brain is displaying a screen shot of the last thing I saw so it only feels like I’m moving, like if I were to try reach to scratch my nose it feels like my hand is going right through my head. While i am in this stage, I will also start to hallucinate voices of people I know talking to me extremely clearly, almost like they are right beside my ears, this is usually random but coherent, this also only happens about half of the time. Then after that I reach the last stage where I am now able to stand up and walk around my house but If I close my eyes it starts all over again, if I try to keep my eyes open I can never make it to far before the thing from the first stage happens again and I am right back where I started, for the record I am fully aware I am in this weird “psychosis” right from the beginning so usally at this point I’m getting up, blinking, and resetting it just so I can get it over with and wake up, then I will just wake back up and everything is normal again. These episodes usally last anywhere from 5-10 minutes but feel more like 30-45. I have no clue what is going on and I can’t exactly google the question lol so I hope someone on here has some info for me about what’s happening. I’m never scared during them that’s why I keep having them, plus when I wake up I feel like I’m rested from a 2 hour nap when it’s only been 5 minutes. The lights are always on, and it’s only ever on this couch, never had it in my bed or anywhere else, I’m probably gonna keep doing it because I honestly have some curiosity about the whole thing and want to see if I can develop a tolerance to it and have fully lucid dreams with no limits cause it’s actually scary how real these dreams are. Sorry for the people reading this I, I just woke up from one of these and thought it’s about time to ask so I kinda just typed it all out without much thought. Some last little bit of info before I’m don’t here but it’s been going on for about 3 months now, if I had to guess how many I’ve had I’d say like 20-30ish, a lot of the time my head will get really loud if that makes any sense, weather it be a loud bang or just really loud static, this is completely random when it happens and it’s honestly my least favourite part of the whole experience. I don’t nap everyday and it only happens 90ish percent of the time, but when it does I know right away it’s gonna happen. Any answers are greatly appreciated and I will answer any questions I’ve left unanswered, thanks!",1768178393.0,0,0,sleep,sleep

1qaa995,Persistent back of neck anxiety + hypnic jerk kept me up despite drowsy,"[mirroring my post from /anxiety]

My first post here, I've quickly over the last few weeks have come to the realization that I'm one of y'all, years of mild to moderate built up stress + depression + possible ocd started manifesting itself in muscle weakness and hyper awareness, I was put on fluoxetine and for a week it had mixed results until last Sunday I had a great bout of worry out of nowhere about my symptoms being from some awful condition which I believe is what led to the biggest and scariest panic attack of my life Wednesday and my first ambulance ride, the hospital visit was nice at least. Only have had fluoxetine on Friday since then.

The last few days I've had general worry and inconsistent temperature control (mostly an annoying fever that changes region, usually my back or neck when I'm on a chair/in bed), the last couple days I had an okay time getting slightly back into the flow of sleep but I've still yet to achieve 8h again.

Last night was the worst because while I was actually pleasantly drowsy for the first time since I don't remember, whenever I drifted away my body went weak, the back of my neck tensed up and felt hot and I'd get a hypnic jerk keeping me awake, consistently for several hours no matter what I did. Does that ever happen with anyone..? I'm trying to limit screen stimulation today, taking a warm bath later at night and having some melatonin.

I could never work out the cause and how to fix it, despite numerous internet searches and supplements, exposure to sunlight or SAD lamps at different times, sleeping tablets to get back to sleep.

In the last few weeks I've deciphered that it is due to eating chocolate in the evenings, or food with a high glycaemic index. It causes a sugar spike which crashes in the middle of the night, causing a surge in cortisol which wakes a sister up to search for more food! I've cut but on my sugar consumption and taken to eating peanut butter in the evening and I've not woken at 3am for some time now! A few weeks in fact.

1qa7jyc,Can't sleep if i don't wear myself out and sleep 5-6 hrs,"hello. this might be long and twisted, but i hope i will make it clearer.

to begin with, i will start with a brief overview of my life. I work as an extracurricular teacher, so my workday starts at around 1PM. I don't need to wake up early. 
I don't spend much energy, because i usually sit or do smth in front of the whiteboard.
Therefore, i usually wake up in between 9 or 10.
The problem arises here. I can't put myself to sleep, i can't fall asleep due to several things
1. For the past 7 years, the only times i had a good time falling asleep were when i woke up quite early (especially at uni times), maybe lacked sleep, spent the day, had a decent amount of physical activity (commuting, walking around and etc), and only then could i not waste time trying to fall asleep.
2. As i mentioned earlier, physical activity. I hated days off, because i just stay at home. So, i don't spend much energy, and whenever i had a day where i didn't do a lot, i couldn't fall asleep
3. Sleep schedule. The later i wake up, the later i go to bed. I think for many people it's the same. But when you don't spend much energy it turns out to be a nightmare. Your sleep schedule was good, then, boom, a day off, you wake up later (by later i mean not 2 pm, but maybe 11 am), and you go to bed later. the schedule is broken
4. i can't just close my eyes and fall asleep. a lot of people told me to do it, but when i try to, i end up tossing and turning in my bed for 1-2 hours not feeling even a glimpse of tiredness, and somehow fall asleep and have the worst night of my life constantly waking up.

all this stuff comes to my burden, my question. how to deal with this shit? for example, my friend may not do much throughout the day, have a good 10hr sleep, but fall asleep at 12 with zero problems. i wish i could do the same. but i would be absolutely awake and present till 3 am.

i've started to spend less time in front of the screen lately before going to bed. i got into diamond mosaic art and i spend my evenings very calmly, doing what i like, just putting these small diamonds onto the picture. so no phone before bed doesn't work. 

i'm taking melatonin, sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't. 

any tips on how to work with this condition? 
pls, if you need any clarification to give advice, ask about it. maybe i have forgotten to mention smth.

1qa6y8a,"For those reliant on having TV or sleep stories to switch off and sleep, is it possible to return to normal?","I saw a sleep psychologist for insomnia and worked through the process to return to sleeping without sleeping pills. Unfortunately, I'm still only able to fall asleep with an old TV show playing. As I sleep with a partner, I use the A30 ear plugs. Without TV or sleep stories, I just can't switch off - I could lay in bed for 8 hours just thinking. The sleep psychologist was happy for this to be a long term strategy. However, we now have a baby and as baby transitions to his own room, I need to be able to be woken by the monitor, so I can't use my ear plugs. 

Has anyone successfully moved from reliance on TV/stories back to falling asleep in silence? Even with ""newborn tired"" I haven't drifted off without my comfort TV show playing.

1q9xtj2,Am I lonely or lacking emotional security,"I think I can only ever fall asleep when I feel safe. I can be sleeping on the floor but as long as I have someone or something that makes me feel safe around me, I can do it no problem. I’ve only come to realise this recently as I’ve been having trouble sleeping again. I always thought I just need some background noise so I played quiet music, then I thought I needed new pillows. Nothing worked. Then one night I got drunk with friends and family, I ended up falling asleep in the arms of one of these “friends” on the couch. I don’t know what we are really but I wish I could tell him that he made me feel so safe, the safest I’ve felt in years. It’s really cringy but now I have to imagine scenarios (typically with him in them) to help me fall asleep. And they can be pretty graphic scenarios too. Some are just sort of simple like him taking care of me when I’m sick or so, but then sometimes my brain comes up with scenes where I may be attacked on a night out for example and I call him and he protects/helps/saves me. And these scenarios are getting kind of dangerous in the sense that I’m setting ridiculously high standards and putting him on a pedestal when I truly don’t know him super well. So Im also questioning whether it’s actually because I’m lonely. Because even in my own home I can’t fall asleep? But I feel like I’m safe there, physically at least. Emotional safety not so much, and I never realised how bad it was until recently because it’s what I grew up with. 

I’m also moving in with said friend and his family in a different state so I’m trying to find a way to move past this because otherwise my already complicated feelings for him will worsen. And I really just wish to find a sustainable solution to my falling asleep problem as I’ve tried a lotttt of things.

I’m wondering if one reason I sleep through my alarms is caused by falling asleep and sleeping with a podcast or white noise playing. 

Falling asleep has always be a challenge for me. I’ve adopted the habit of needing a podcast or  white noise playing in order to fall sleep. 

I’m a very heavy sleeper and never ever wake up in the middle of the night for any reason. 

I sleep through my alarms fairly often. I have a Hatch (I hate it) set to maximum volume and brightness as well as 10 alarms on my phone that go off every 10 minutes and i still am able to sleep through it all. I’ve confirmed I don’t turn off or snooze my alarms in my sleep, I truly just sleep through it somehow. 

Is it possible that my brain is accustomed to noise while sleeping, and when my alarm goes off the noise doesn’t trigger a “wake up reflex” since I’m used to being asleep with noise?

The main challenge is sleep. With this schedule, I’d only be sleeping from 2:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m., or roughly 5 hours a night. My idea is to push myself hard during those 10 hours so I can fall asleep immediately and get high-quality, deep sleep despite the shorter duration.

I know this isn’t healthy long-term and that sleep is more complicated than just “working harder,” but I feel like it *might* be doable, especially since I’ll be able to sleep normally on Saturdays and Sundays because of church and Sunday school.

1q9k48a,Night terrors,"I’ve recently experienced these terrifying dreams that extend into reality. 

These dreams come and go but tend to come during periods of sadness or stress. They cause me to feel extreme panic to the point I actually jump out of bed and try to escape. So far it’s occurred 5 times in the past year, only 2 I vividly remember. 

The first memorable occurrence was around late 2024. I was working in a hospital and going to university, still unsure about my life, friends decisions (could have played a role). I had this panic in my head about the mafia, I had this belief that they were coming to steal me or kill me. I jumped out of bed with adrenaline pumping through my brain. I screamed out to my family to run as I opened my door and ran down the street 3-4am in my underwear. I realized that I was insane at the 100m mark and walked back home. 

Recently (last night) I was sleeping and had the exact same feeling, I tried to run out my room desperately. I thought that a roller coaster ride was pulling me out of my bed and house and I wasn’t getting enough air. I wanted to run out of my house so much but I didn’t. 

I tend to notice these things occur when I’m hiding something from myself or not addressing things that need addressing. Stress, anxiety or escapism episodes in real life translating into night terrors. 

Not sure though, maybe other people have experienced similar things? ",1768090086.0,1,1,sleep,sleep

1q9itld,I think this is more than just an Insomia,"(Pardon my English because it is not my first languange)

Hi 20M here. Ever since I was a kid, I've experiencing difficulty in sleeping. Like having nightmares (constantly) like I was chased by a big boulder cornered inside of a room or like having thoughts of someone I knew dies. This terrifies me as a child but adults around me sees this as a simple matter and says that just pray. Honestly it didn't help at all but just worsen it.

Around 15 y.o. I'm having moments where I just stare at the wall or counting invisible sheeps just to tire my brain and maybe somehow make me fall asleep. Not to mention, the place where I live is near around Entertainment District so even at night, It is still noisy outside...

Then in  Dec 2024, My father was rushed to the hostipal. He was on Critical state that time. With this problem and also school loads as I'm in my busiest time as College Student, I can't sleep at night anymore. I mean literally, Falling asleep on 6AM onwards.. During that time It was either stressing myself on works in school or in house or crying because of the state of our situation. This went for atleast my father got out of the hospital. The stressing or crying at night stop but the sleepless night continues. One time I almost fainted during an Exam but good thing I manage to drag myself into the clinic where a doctor there checked on me and ruled out that I have an Insomia. The doctor gave me some prescription of sleeping suplements but honestly, It doesn't work on me... I stop taking those because of some feedback around me that taking those are harmful to my own body.

Everytime I sleep during night, I have may taken some sleep for like an hour or two but I'm always jolting myself back awake and not being able to sleep for the rest of the night. 

It is affecting my life now and It is so hard to work around it. Like having blinds or eyemask, off screentime, earplugs even meditating and breathing exercise. All it was just to make me yawn but my brain is still active. 

For those experience things like this, can you gave me some advice on what should I do? If I really need to visit a doctor, What kind of doctor should I go seek help? ",1768086779.0,1,5,sleep,sleep

I was in bed, eyes closed, trying to fall asleep. I was still fully conscious, just relaxing, and then I slowly felt my body starting to shut down. Like I was being pulled or sinking, and then suddenly I couldn’t move at all.
I tried to move, tried to open my eyes, but they were like half open and snapping shut. My body felt like it was getting crushed or pressed from both sides. No visuals, no demons or anything, just this insanely uncomfortable pressure and panic. I was fully aware the whole time and freaking out.
I kept fighting it and eventually managed to break out, rolled around, changed positions a few times, and then eventually fell asleep without even realizing when I did.
For context: I had a long nap yesterday evening (which I NEVER do), went to bed late, and at some point I was on my back. This hasn’t happened to me in forever.

I have sleep apnea and currently using CPAP therapy which is very good when I don't struggle falling asleep.

My issue is when I go to bed (usually around 12am) and I need to be awake at 7am I really really struggle to fall asleep. I think this is because I know if I don't fall asleep fast I'm not going to get enough sleep and I'm going to be tired all day the next day and this is creating a pressure to fall asleep which makes it worse.

Often times it takes me 2-3hrs to get to sleep but on a weekend or a night when I have no work in the morning and I have no pressure to fall asleep because I have nothing to be awake for I fall asleep within 30mins and have a very productive sleep.

1q9aooi,How can I be awake for a longer time?,"So I mag have basically reverse insomnia, i.e. I’m only awake for a short window of time.

How my schedule usually goes is (no school): I go to sleep naturally at 12, wake up at 11, stay in bed until 12, and by the time I’m done with shower and breakfast it’s already 2, so then I go to work at 4 until 9:30, then go home, stress over what to do, then sleep at 12

  
school days:

sleep at 12 again, wake up at 7 to my alarm, stay in bed for 20 minutes (sometimes I have to skip shower and/or breakfast because class is at 8), go to classes half awake (I dreamt in class a few times) until 3 on Mondays, Tuesdays, or Thursdays, 4 on Wednesdays (which is a clinical I have to drive an hour to). Then on 3 of those days I’ll work from 4-9:30 again.

  
Note that it is impossible for me to modify my schedule, I am in a nursing school with a very invariable schedule so my counselor kinda just makes it for all of us each semester, and also I’m willing to try unorthodox tricks to waking up (salts, vicks vaporub, or anything, as long as Walmart sells it) cause if not reminded, I simply lack the willpower to force myself out of bed, which is usually how every morning goes. I’ll be mad it took me so long to get out of bed and that I have little time to study, but I’ll feel hate that I can’t fix it until the next day.

If I put it on 1, you could barely tell it was on. If I put it on about 3 or 4 it was comfortable warm. Put it up to 10 is too hot, but great for preheating the bed.

Now I'm trying to buy one. Apparently around 15 years ago, they all changed the way they're designed. This is good for safety, but I have a problem: I've tried 4 different brands of electric blanket now, including the cheapest sunbeam from walmart, and for all of them, even when I put them on the lowest setting, they're too hot to sleep.

Only 1 blanket, from heynemo, advertises temperatures. They say 89F at setting 1, and 108F at setting 10. I don't know about you, but for me, 89F is wayyy too hot for comfortable sleep. If it were a summer night at 89F, I would have no blankets, and probably the AC running.

Has anybody found, or know anything, about finding an electric blanket where the lowest setting isn't too hot?

A bit of a background story: Last year a lot of stressful/painful things happened in my life, my relationship ended and the only friendship I had ended abruptly and very painfully. And I live in a place that was also causing me chronic stress, but the last couple of months it got even worse. So everything really got piled up. Then I was unable to begin with a (group)therapy due to how overwhelmed I was at the time. So this was all happening while I have no friends or community, only a couple social aquintances at work. The last month or so I began to have anxiety attacks, it was like my body was beginning to react stronger when I was feeling stress. Like it would build up and I would feel really horrible. I went to my parents place for the winter holiday where I still am, to be away from the place I'm living in. But I can also feel stressed sometimes when I'm at my parents house, because I just don't like to be around my dad. I just can't bond with him at all and don't want to, in the way that I bond and can easily talk to my mom and feel safe around her. But I do have to interact with him when I'm there obviously, I always try to keep it short. I know in my head that there is no danger but I still feel anxious around him a lot of the time.

Last week I often felt anxious/had anxiety attacks, more than usual, and then at the beginning of this week I did something what really overstimulated/disregulated my nervous system and since then I feel completely broken. I can't sleep anymore like I used to. It's like that ability is gone because I'm stuck in fight or flight. Not sleeping makes me anxious and because of that anxiety I can't sleep. I'm stuck in a vicious cycle. This week I only got 1 night of good sleep, the rest of the nights were torturous. My body feels horrible and I feel completely exhausted. I'm afraid something bad is going to happen, like I'm going to collapse and die. I try to sleep during the day but it doesn't work, and I tried so many things. Herbal stuff and listening to guided meditations/audio books, positive thinking, acceptance. I've been researching and reading and watching videos about this, but I can't get rid of the anxiety around my symptoms. Today I got strong medication, I don't really want to medicate myself but it feels like there is no other option anymore. I can't believe I'm in this state now, it feels like a nightmare. I just want to be able to sleep again. Even if it's just 2 hours.

I’ve spent so many weekends doing just that. I would wake up, still remain in bed for 30 mins, scroll on my phone, put on a YT video to feel less lonely, and then fall right back asleep. Some weekends I would fall asleep early after coming from uni on Friday evening, and then not get to work until 3PM on Sunday. I just skip days. Risk everything, and not even care.

But both of us are so hot we can't sleep through the night. Heat is just radiating under the covers. Most nights I feel like I am sleeping on a heating pad. Don't even get me started on the summer... I've been getting skin infections each year because I sweat so badly. We have tried multiple fans, cooling sheets. I am at my wit's end. 

Both of us need something heavy and fluffy for our blanket at night to be able to sleep. My husband will NOT use a top sheet. I have been trying for years. We also cant wash a standard comforter in our washing machine because theu become too waterlogged and stalls the machine, so our current winter set up is literally only a lightweight duvet in a duvet cover. In summer we do a quilt with a throw blanket and both of us hate that.

I've been living with my girlfriend for the past six months or so, and she *hates* my Apple Watch. She tolerates that I wear it, but she hates brushing past it or feeling the metal/glass texture when we’re in bed. Same with the buzzing that she can feel when we're cuddling on the couch when I get a notification, or when we're holding hands and it brushes past her.

I literally barely notice it--i've worn watches all my life and I barely notice the vibrations when I'm at work (plus I have most notifications off). Though, I would like to make the shift to not wearing a wearable at night in general. I love her, and it's one less thing to worry about, but I need a sleep tracker for my Parkinson's Disease, as sleep quality is a good projection of what sort of day I'm going to have.

1q8hpbv,Would custom earplugs help someone who can't sleep with most types of earplugs?,"**If you are someone who could** ***not*** **sleep with conventional earplugs due to discomfort, then switched to custom earplugs:**  
**How do they feel to you compared to conventional earplugs? What material did you choose?**

I am an extremely light sleeper, and would wake up from the slightest noise.

Over the years, I've experimented with many types of earplugs as a **side-sleeper**. Issue is, they always cause enough discomfort for me to either not be able to fall asleep at all, wake up frequently, or get terrible sleep quality.

**Loop ear plugs** consistently wake me due to the pressure on the side I sleep on;  
**Moldable silicon earplugs** cause an unbearable itch;  
**Moldable wax earplugs** don't itch for me, but then the pillow gets waxy and feels awful.

The best earplugs I got at so far are the **German soft foam** ones, which I can manage to sleep with. I had a housemate who literally did *not* sleep, and made calls on speaker phone all night most of the nights. Over months, I eventually got *more* used to wearing soft foam earplugs all night, but they feel inconsistent - They still frequently wake me up; Sometimes I still cannot fall asleep with them in. Sometimes they bother my inner ear canal, sometimes they don't.

I want to commit to getting custom-made earplugs from an audiologist now. But, I've found some Reddit comments mentioning that custom-made earplugs can still cause a lot of discomfort to some people. I want to know how common of an issue this could be for people like me, who are easily bothered by most ear plugs. Wanna figure out whether this is a risk worth taking.

( we do a lot of bullshit stuff in school, it drains the hell out of me cause I have a weak body & immune system. ) I eat dinner and do my works till 12:00am, then I wake up at 5:00am because my school starts at 7:10. I prefer my schedule now because my sleep is continous and like somehow I’m more productive at night, because I only take around 2 hours to finish my schoolworks and study/revise/review till 4am, but with my old one, I only get to do my school works which takes 4 hours. only downgrade is I don’t get to see my mama coming home from work anymore :( but I can manage since I see her every morning. please reply, if its unhealthy ill asap change my schedule.

1q80fdi,"Chronic insomnia (staying asleep) since childhood — Unisom works, but not sustainable. Medication experiences?","I’ve had insomnia for as long as I can remember, literally since childhood.
The issue is not falling asleep — it’s staying asleep. I wake up multiple times a night or wake too early and can’t get back to sleep.

I currently do all the sleep hygiene things:
	•	No caffeine
	•	Phone never in the bedroom
	•	Dark, cool room
	•	Consistent schedule
	•	Exercise
	•	Epsom salt baths before bed

I’ve tried melatonin, thc, cbd, an array of vitamins and ramelteon and they did absolutely nothing.

Right now Ive been taking Unisom for the past two weeks (doxylamine) and it works like a charm — I stay asleep — but I know it’s not a good long-term solution, especially due to tolerance and anticholinergic effects.

I’m looking into other medication options and trying to avoid anything with major weight gain or long-term cognitive risks.

Has anyone with lifelong insomnia / middle-of-the-night awakenings found something that actually works long-term?
Especially interested in experiences with:
	•	Low-dose doxepin
	•	Nortriptyline
	•	Agomelatine
	•	Or anything else that helped staying asleep, not sleep onset

1q80ay0,Has anyone noticed that sleeping with a side/ body pillow makes falling asleep feel..easier?,"I'm a 19M, just entered college. posting this more out of curiosity than anything else.I've dealt with sleep-onset insomnia and broken sleep for a while now. Nothing extreme, but enough that nights often feel long and restless. One thing I've noticed is that nights feel harder when I'm lying there with nothing ""anchoring"" me - I feel more restless, sometimes oddly lonely or uneasy, even if mentally I'm fine during the day.A while back, I started sleeping on my side with a firm pillow along my body (between legs + against my torso). Later I experimented with making a slightly heavier/denser side pillow for myself. What surprised me was how consistently my sleep improved. Things I've noticed over time: Falling asleep feels more natural, less forced Less tossing and turning Fewer random wake-ups during the night Sleep feels more continuous rather than fragmented I've tried melatonin before - sometimes it helped, sometimes it didn't - but this feels different. More like removing physical restlessness rather than inducing sleep. I'm not saying this ""treats"" insomnia or works for everyone. I'm just wondering:

Has anyone else felt calmer or less restless sleeping with a body/side pillow?Do you think it's posture, pressure, comfort... or something psychological like feeling less alone at night? Have weighted blankets or similar things had a comparable effect for you?Curious if this is a common experience or just something specific to my body/sleep pattern.

3) Within 10-15 minutes, I am able to go to sleep

4) Within half an hour however, I wake up

After that, I just keep ""tossing and turning"" for hours. It's not that I am completely alert; just that I am not able to cross over to sleep. Ultimately, I end up resorting to sleeping pills, in order to fall asleep.

I’m unable to sleep, I’m doing everything I think I can to get myself to get ready to go to bed but it’s not working, skincare, brushing my teeth, taking melatonin, putting my phone up for a while before and I still end up tossing and turning.
But it’s not really working, when the melatonin is working I’m knocking out for 4 hours and waking up and staying up: and it’s like 20mg. 
When it’s not it’s like I can feel everything, hair moving from my fan, fabric touching skin, all of that and on top of that it’s resulting in this weird exhaustion and almost aroused overstimulated state thats leaving me feeling warm and itchy and awful.. any advice?

1q7elds,It’s getting miserable,"I’ve recently started getting more active to fill out my days, mostly because I felt like I was wasting the time after work by just coming home.

Thing is I’m part time. One day I could be closing and the next opening, and it’s really screwing me up. After work, when I’m usually closing (which is almost always) I go to the gym and get home about 1AM. Go to sleep, wake up around 10-12, do whatever I need to do, and then work again. With this cycle, on top of going to the gym consistently AND being randomly put on opening shifts, I’m so miserably tired. Falling asleep while standing, no energy to do anything, and I can’t wake up anytime before 10 or 11am anymore without feeling like a zombie. I’m at a standstill and think maybe I need to start waking up early everyday to get used to it

1q7el9x,Can you have brainfog due to sleep deprivation without feeling tired?,"I (25F) have been dealing with brainfog for around 3 years now and I think it's been getting worse. I've had some fatigue and tiredness, but not too much, not even to a level of actual drowsiness. Granted, I don't remember the last time I woke up refreshed and felt actually energized, but I also haven't noticed any problems sleeping. No insomnia, no waking up, a good 8h or more of *seemingly* good, uninterrupted, deep sleep.

And for the level of brainfog I have, I just feel I should be way more tired, if it was sleep related? I've gone through periods of sleeping way too little and being really tired during high school, and even then I didn't have to deal with remotely this level of cognitive fuckery.

No screens.

If you can’t sleep — get up.
Dim the lights.
Control the room.
Control yourself.
At some point it started adding pressure to an already anxious, tired mind — like sleep became another task to perform correctly.

1q7dc68,Realising my sleep problems were more about stress than sleep itself,"Lately I’ve realised that most of my sleep issues weren’t about my mattress, caffeine, or sleep mechanics at all. It was stress. Even when I was physically tired, my brain just wouldn’t fully switch off and I’d wake up multiple times a night for no obvious reason.

What helped wasn’t more sleep hacks, but focusing on winding down my nervous system. Cutting screen time before bed, keeping a consistent bedtime, and actually letting my body relax instead of scrolling until I passed out made a difference. Making my sleep setup feel calmer helped too. Small comfort changes added up more than I expected, even things like switching to a cooler bamboo pillowcase from Luff Sleep made nights feel less restless.

It’s not a magic fix, but once I started treating sleep as a stress issue rather than a sleep quality issue, things slowly improved.

1q7cfve,Night sweats help!,"So for about the last two and a half months I’ve been having pretty bad night sweats almost every night. I am a 37yo female. I had my last annual exam and blood work in October 2025 and things were normal. I sleep with a normal sheet, a light blanket, and a comforter. I’m someone that is cold all the time so I often have to use the comforter to stay warm. However I keep waking up 1-2x per night feeling humid under the blankets and very sweaty, sometimes to the point where I need a towel. I’ve tried using lighter blankets but I just end up too cold and getting a warmer blanket but then have night sweats. I’ve started just sleeping in a tank top most nights but still end up having night sweats.

Lately, though, the problem has changed. I do fall asleep, but my experience of sleep feels completely different. Even when I’m asleep, I feel conscious — having extremely vivid dreams and feeling like I could wake up at any moment. After these nights I’m utterly exhausted, in a very specific and unpleasant way. Honestly, it feels worse than when I couldn’t sleep at all and was awake all night.

This is hard to describe, but as I start drifting off my mind begins to spiral with random, uncontrollable thoughts — and it feels like this continues even while I’m “asleep,” never really stopping.

EDIT: One thing I also am getting is a an ""andrenaline dump feeling"" where as I start drifting off i will have a rush of adrenaline. I know this can happen from time to time but this is practically every night mow and quite severe.

The only thing that reliably stops this is zopiclone, which makes me think it’s anxiety-related. That said, I don’t actually feel particularly stressed — certainly not compared to periods in the past when I couldn’t fall asleep at all.

On top of this, I’ve noticed coinciding gut issues: severe bloating, waking with an extremely sore stomach, and a bad taste in my mouth (night-time reflux). Ive found a way to manage this aspect largely with histamine blockers and was hopeful that controlling that would then have a flow on effect to the sleep issue but sadly that doesnt seem to be the case. Im now starting to rely a bit on zipiclone which obviously is an awful idea however I am so mentally drained the next day if I dont do this that im stuck between a rock and a hard place.

1q76pjl,Heated Blankets are designed to break. Get a Heated Mattress Pad instead.,"I've gone through three $60 heated throw blankets in the last two years. They all fail the same way: The controller starts blinking, or one spot gets super hot while the rest stays cold.

I finally talked to an electrician who explained it: It's mechanical stress. Every time you fold a throw blanket on the couch, you are bending the thin copper wires inside. Eventually, they snap.

I switched to a **Heated Mattress Pad** (Sunbeam) this year. Because it sits flat under the sheet and never moves/folds, the wires don't break. Plus, heat rises, so it traps the warmth under the duvet instead of letting it escape to the ceiling.

If you're tired of replacing blankets every winter, stop buying throws. Get the pad.

My boyfriend told me he comes in our room, wakes me up, and has conversations with me that I can’t remember. Conversations that I was participating in.

1q7286s,"Stop guessing. Stop copying other people’s routines. Figure out what actually matters for your sleep. For me, it was night time sugar level.","I burned out on sleep scores.

5 points up. 7 points down.  
Okay… so what? What exactly changes because I know that?

Same with REM and deep sleep..

What I eventually realized is this:  
**precision matters less than patterns.**  
What matters is noticing trends and understanding *why* they break.

But most of us, myself included for a long time, were distracted by clean-looking numbers instead of meaningful insights. Wearables gave us metrics, not understanding.

At the same time, there’s an endless stream of influencers telling you:

* do this routine
* take that supplement
* wake up at this exact time
* eat/not eat this thing

I couldn’t follow all of it. And honestly, I didn’t even know which of those things mattered for me.

**You can’t just “decide” to increase deep sleep or REM.**  
**Sleep isn’t a switch. It’s an output.**

Sunlight exposure, meal timing, what you eat, when you exercise, stress... **everything is connected. I wanted to know which levers actually mattered for my body, instead of guessing or copying.**

For me, the obsession started with **deep sleep**.

No matter how much I increased total sleep time, my deep sleep barely moved.

That was incredibly frustrating. And that frustration is what eventually led me to build **EON**, just to answer one question:

**What is actually blocking my deep sleep?**

Long story short. Here’s what I found.

**1) Meal timing mattered more than I expected**  
With the MVP version of EON, the first strong pattern that showed up was a high correlation between **dinner timing and my deep sleep**.

At that time, I wasn’t particularly interested in intermittent fasting. I knew it was trendy, controversial, loved by some, hated by others. But once I saw *my own data*, I started experimenting with earlier dinners and longer fasting windows.

Not because the internet said so, because my sleep did.

**2) Then carbs entered the picture (and surprised me)**  
With the EON beta product, I started logging meals in more detail through connected more nutrition databases.

That’s when another pattern emerged:

* Carbs had a strong relationship with my deep sleep
* Too many carbs → deep sleep suffered
* Too few carbs → also bad

The sweet spot mattered. Especially **in the evening**.

What really clicked was this:  
It wasn’t “carbs are bad.”  
**It was evening blood sugar stability that mattered** ***for me***.

**3) Reality check: life still happens**  
Lately I’ve been under a lot of stress. Ate ice cream late at night a few times. And yep, EON immediately flagged the pattern 😅

I’m not perfect. I don’t maintain an ideal routine every day. No one does.

But here’s the difference now:

**Before, I was anxious. especially before important events.**  
**I** ***needed*** **to sleep well, and that pressure itself became stress.**  
(Anyone who struggles with sleep knows that irony.)

**Now, I understand how my body responds.**  
**I know what matters.**  
**I know what I can control.**

Even when things go off-track, I’m no longer guessing and that alone **removes a huge amount of fear.**

**Knowing your own feedback loop is power.**

Not because it makes sleep perfect.  
**But because it makes sleep** ***understandable.***

I built EON for this exact reason.

Me and my twin share a room and he snores bad I used to a little but after losing weight I stopped but he’s like 300 pounds. I have to wear like two hoodies like 3 comforters over me and a bigass squishmallow over my head just to muffle it enough to sleep. I’ve tried earplugs and everything and nothing works. And it’s not just snoring he moans in his sleep and just makes random noises constantly so he’ll just be making noise with every inhale and exhale and they just sound so wet and gross most ppl you can tell it’s js like a vibration it’s like he has a pool of saliva it has to go thru and it’s loud. It’s been like this forever and I’ve shared a room with him my whole life. And the worst part he has no job he’s constantly in the room and never leaves and mouth breathes constantly loud asl so I can’t escape it. 

So if I wanna sleep I gotta do all that w the hoodies blankets and pillows or sleep downstairs on a tiny couch and my dad works nights at UPS so he’ll go to bed at like midnight so I can’t sleep even downstairs till then then he gets back up at 3 am for work obv not caring I’m asleep waking me up, so then I’ll need like 2 hours to get to sleep cuz I’m not as tired then my mom wakes up at 6 am to do wtv, so then I’m not able to sleep upstairs or downstairs

it was teaching my brain that bed = effort.

the earlier i went to bed, the more pressure i added.

1q6lxe9,"Used to be able to wake up, since last week I can't. what went wrong?","Hello, I am 17M. recently (as far as I remember, since last week of december) It's become exponentially harder for me to wake up.   
It's not like I used to wake up strictly at 5 daily or anything but I could wake up arround 7 (my school starts at 8) and at 8-9 on weekends (I had extra classes at 10). 

It's important you understand my position, I'm Indian and like many I study for various engineering College entrance tests (well I don't really study but that's another can of worms). For this students generally go for extra coaching classes after school which is 3-4 hours long. For me that's 8-13 school, 16-20 coaching. The timings for coaching used to vary from 15-16 but that wasn't a big issue. On Sundays my coaching used to have morning classes 8-12 or 10-12 which I didn't have much issue waking up for. I also could get 30-40 minute naps before my coaching and wake up feeling refreshed. 

even before I start having these issues I used to stretch my nights and sleep very late, I used to sometimes stay late until 21 in my coaching and I'd get home by 22. used to have an habit of extending my dinner for an entire hour so it would be either 22 or 23 by the time I finished my dinner. (also to note, I didn't feel much guilty or conscious about all these things because I was and still am unable to study by myself so it didn't 'feel' like time waste). I also still have the habit of going to bed at 2, after 24 or 1 I had this kinda bad habit of watching porn for an entire hour, at I'd only go to sleep by 2. 

last week december, due to some previous procrastination I had to go through few days, constantly going to bed at 4-5. I spent pretty much an entire week going to bed after 3. and since then it had been bad. after other academics caused mental issues I started to switch up my schedule and started to skip coaching classes (I used to have 100% attendance no matter what). for the last week the pattern is consistent, I waste most the day then stay up late. this used to be the same previously too but Idk why it's only become a problem now. 

previously, I used to wake up automatically once I hit the 8 hour sleep mark (adding sleep debt to that if there was any), I could even set short naps and  not snooze TOO much. I had relied on my parent to wake me up and when I was home alone I'd wake up after 1-2 snoozes. depending on my mood i'd get up earlier or later and even in bad moods I would still be able to get up at worst an hour late then what I'm supposed to get up at.

ever since this year, I've been the lowest i've ever been past 2 years and waking up at 13-14, wasting most the day (bad mood wake ups used to be 10-12, on non school days and this was the first few times I couldn't wake up even though I had to go to school). when I skipped coaching classes I used to 'nap' 2-3 hours, I'd only nap for an hour then wake up to an almost completed sunset. 

even my dreams and sleep have become more vivid and delusional. I almost daily think I'm living normal life in the dreams feel too drawn in them, even after being woken up by people or alarms, I shut my eyes again and I'm able to resume my dreams.   
Almost every morning I can't even process what's happening, people don't make sense, I go through with my morning routine but my brain can't process (I brush my teeth but in my head, I'm doing and achieving something completely different and far fetched) one day I couldn't process my alarm and connected it with my dreams, in my head some director was trying to sync music to his film and I was helping him in it somehow, in reality i had snoozed 4-5 times (the black alarm screen filling up my entire vision like a vr game). 

I really don't know why only now I'm begging to face difficulty waking up, could it be my depression or just all the bad habits i've picked up until now, I really need some help because I'm at a very low and even basic things like sleep aren't in check, it just gets hard for me. 

TLDR; I'm a 17-year-old who, for 2 years, pushed through a brutal schedule of school and coaching. which over this year, but since late December, I've crashed hard. I now struggle desperately to wake up, sleeping until 13 or 14. My sleep is filled with intensely vivid, absorbing dreams that feel more real than my foggy, confused mornings. I blend dreams with reality and can't process basic thoughts when I first get up. It's like my body and mind are completely shutting down after running on empty for so long. I'm at my lowest point and don't know if this is something deeper like depression or something even worse. ",1767807534.0,1,1,sleep,sleep

Nothing works. I wake up, put the alarm off, and if I have multiple, I take my phone with me and then can do it numerous times before waking up on my own.

1q6d6jh,"After years of light, broken sleep, I finally found a setup that makes nights feel less hostile","for a long time my insomnia wasn’t about falling asleep.

it was about how aware I was of everything once I was in bed.

every sound felt sharp. fabric touching my skin felt wrong. the mattress never quite disappeared underneath me. my brain stayed on alert, like it was waiting for something to go wrong.

I tried the usual stuff over the years. routines, cutting caffeine, tracking sleep. some helped, some didn’t. what actually made a difference was stacking small changes that calmed my nervous system instead of fighting it.

the firm mattress was part of that. not because it was “better”, but because it felt predictable. my body stopped sinking and adjusting all night. once I lay down, the surface stayed the same.

I also added comfortable earplugs and steady white noise. not to block the world completely, just to smooth out sudden sounds so my brain didn’t keep checking for threats.

my phone gets turned off after my shower now. not face down, not silent — fully off. that part mattered more than I expected.

the biggest shift though was what happens after the shower.

no scrolling. lights low. I get into bed, naked on the mattress, and just breathe. slow, deep breaths. no replaying conversations, no planning, no people, no thoughts to solve. if something pops up, I let it pass.

I still don’t sleep perfectly.

But then I think I was falling asleep again but my ears started ringing and humming and it felt like I got massive goosebumps in my head and my arms was paralyzed. The paralyzing part lasted like second cause I freaked out and woke up immediately.

I have had sleep paralysis before and I know how to wake myself up and I thought could that been starting sleep paralysis or what the heck was that. Never ever have I felt like that before.

So I’m wondering how do parents optimize and hack their own sleep? 

My 4 year old sleeps around 10 pm - husband handles his bedtime routine for the most part but he needs shepherding himself to do my son’s bedtime so I don’t really get to sleep before my son.

We tried sleep training the 8 month old with the Ferber method and made some progress but an episode of sickness set her back so now she gets nursed and rocked to sleep every night around 9.30 pm.

I realize both kids bedtimes are super late, but they just don’t seem to get tired enough before then - or baby will take a nap around 5.30 pm and wake up at 7.30 pm as happened today. 

After they go to bed is when I have to clean the kitchen and get the house in order a bit and then I want some time to myself before I sleep so it ends up being 11,30 when I’m in bed. And then the baby wakes up 2-4 times per night to nurse. 

Is this normal?! I have friends who are working full time and have two children of similar ages but they don’t seem as tired and worn out as me. One friend said she barely wakes up at night when her baby wakes up even though she nurses her I guess in her sleep?!

1q643ff,Advice needed on what could possibly be happening,"I (34F) have been waking up confused and panicked. Today was the second time since Saturday morning this has happened and I'm kind of concerned about it. 

Saturday morning probably around 3-4 am if I was to guess since I didn't actually check the time, I remember having a dream about needing to get ready for work or I'll be late. I was then getting out of bed in a panic because I was running behind and by the time I had snapped out of it I was already in the middle of putting on deodorant. I was completely confused because I didn't actually have to work Saturday but I remember everything so clearly. 

Today I got in bed after a night shift around 8:30 am and the same thing happened where I was dreaming and jumped out of bed to get ready for work. I snapped out of it because my alarm didn't actually go off yet and it was only 11 something in the morning. 

For context, I work 12 hour shift work, I also have 2 young kids, and I have an autoimmune disease of the thyroid (Hashimoto's). So good sleep has been hard to come by since I had my oldest 6 years ago. 

So, I'm just hoping this is happening because of the lack of good sleep, but I don't even know what to call it because it just seems to be this weird dream/awake phase that I'm finding myself in. I have never been a sleep walker and I have only found myself sleep talking or sometimes crying on occasions that I know I am severely sleep deprived.

For most of my life, sleep was passive. I’d even procrastinate it, especially on school or work nights, because I didn’t want to “fast-forward” to the next day. I slept fine even during stressful periods.

Things shifted after a stretch of night shifts / schedule changes (days → nights → stuck on nights). Since then, sleep feels like something I have to manage instead of something that just happens. And I was going through some nights where I had little to no sleep which triggered some fears of not sleeping or getting enough sleep. ( my true fear is 0 hrs of sleep)

Now I catch myself worrying about sleep way too 
early in the evening, monitoring whether I’ll fall asleep, and thinking about how bad the next day will be if I don’t.

I use CBD sometimes and hydroxyzine (PRN) on tougher nights. They help, but I’ve noticed that even when meds work, my brain is still “watching” my body, waiting to feel sleepy. That monitoring seems to keep me more alert instead of relaxed.
What’s frustrating is that objectively:

I still sleep most nights

I’ve slept my whole life without issues

I know this feels very similar to OCD/anxiety 
rumination patterns I’ve had before.

But the meaning of sleep has changed. It went from “whatever” to “this needs to happen or tomorrow is ruined,” and that pressure seems to be the problem. For anyone who’s been through something similar:

How did you stop mentally supervising sleep?

How did you get back to a more passive relationship with it?

Did schedule disruptions trigger this for you too?

I failed on sticking to the fundamentals: consistent bedtimes, wind-down routines, early meals, etc.

So as a passion project, we are building an app for that.

It's not a sleep app but a sleep discipline system. It helps you structure and stick to the best sleep habits.

We use some standard habit building features like starting small and adding more and some innovative features like a Sleep Twin that evolves as you stick with actions. Think of it as a momentum tracker, not a rigid streak.

Our app validates where possible that you actually do the tasks and we also have a feature of a social partner that further puts pressure on you actually doing what you set out to do and a community to get support and share wins. You cannot game the app, just improve. :)

The app is really for those people who are fed up with poor sleep and need help with follow through... or just want to outsource their discipline! I slept better as a kid, maybe because my parents enforced bedtimes and no screen rules?

We are in the idea validation phase, so if you like what we do, sign up for the waitlist or community and if you don't please give me your open feedback here... no hard feelings.

\* No food and minimal water 2 hours before bed

\* Taking magnesium glycinate 2 hours before bed and 2 mg of melatonin 30 minutes before sleep time

\* Adderall for the last 12 years (20mg XR at 7am and 10mg IR at 3, only use the XR on weekends)

\* Can’t fall asleep earlier than 11pm  if I wake up at 7am even if I’m exhausted, but I feel like I need more sleep than I’m getting (probably due to the stimulants)

\* Social Jetlag and sleeping 12-14 hours on weekends if I don’t set up an alarm (I usually feel rested on these days)

I have one now. It's been there a few weeks now. It is a very light infection probably, it does not bother me really but it's annoying and I feel sensations and hear a sounds from inflamation. Does anyone have a cheat to deal with this that comes up from time to time.

The ear doctor i went to last year when I had a more serious one was just an ass and unfelpful - told me to just stop and not use them - that's not possible because it's the best thing in my life.

I see people that sleep with plugs for 25 years with the exact same plugs I use. 3M disposable orange foam earplugs. I change them every single day.  
How do you deal with this issue?

My gp gave me naphtalene hydrochloride drops which work great (they are antifungal drops for nail fungus) - but naphtalene is cancerogenic, particularly causing cancer of the larynx. I don't want to keep dropping them in my ear right next to my larynx.

1q5kt55,Intense evening sports = wired but tired at night. What worked for you?,"Hey everyone,

36M here. I’ve played a lot of ball/dek hockey over the years, but for the past couple of years I’ve noticed something annoying with my sleep after evening games.

I usually play around 7 pm. I don’t feel anxious or stressed mentally, but on game nights I feel super “wired” when I go to bed. Stuff like:

\- Being very aware of my heartbeat (not fast, just noticeable)

\- Feeling restless in bed, constantly changing positions

\- Light, broken sleep even though I still get some hours in

What’s weird is that when I’m on vacation or not playing intense sports, my sleep is deep and solid. So this really seems tied to intense evening exercise / adrenaline rather than anxiety or classic insomnia.

I’m not looking for medical advice — just real-world tips from people who kept training at night and figured out how to sleep better (I love this sport and won't quit).

Things I’m curious about:

\- Anything you do right after games that helps you wind down

\- Stuff that actually made it worse

\- Did your body eventually adapt?

\- Any simple hacks that worked without killing performance?

I have very good sleep when i fall asleep in time but this rarely happens. I have to wake up at 6AM Mon-Fri for work and my body just will not fall asleep until like 11PM and i wake up feeling un rested and tired like i need an extra hour or 2. On the holidays & on weekends, i am sleeping 8-9 hours per night sometimes 10 and i wake up at 8-9AM naturally and felt very rested. My deep sleep is normally like 1.5H and REM 2H. So i am getting sufficient amounts of them most nights. I also have tried magnesium, glycine, baths, listening to podcasts, sleep stories, reading, deep breathing, meditation , mostly off my phone the hour before i plan to turn the lights off. I used to deal with very bad insomnia a few years ago where i just could not sleep at all and was only getting 1-2 hours per night during the week. Now, i have read a few books on insomnia. I understand how the sleep anxiety was causing the bulk of my problems and accepted that i may have a bad night of sleep every now and again - it improved so much since. But still, it takes me 1-2 hours to fall asleep every night, even if i am not anxious about sleeping anymore or anxious in general. 
I’ve got my melatonin and wakening cortisol checked and both seem to be ok with my cortisol clearance rate being a little sluggish but i am making enough melatonin to fall asleep in the evenings. 
Im wondering if it’s something to do with my body clock? Maybe my body clock has a preference to wake up at around 8-9AM and to sleep at 11PM.

Since I was around 13, 3 years ago, while I was going through puberty, I've been having very bad issues with my sleep. I constantly sleep very late, and have more than dozens of times pulled all-nighters either because I didn't feel like going to bed, had homework to complete and didn't want to disappoint my teachers, or in hopes that it would enable me to sleep early fix my sleep schedule the next day (of course, I either fell asleep before this could happen, or never stuck to my repaired sleeping time the next day).

I'm worried this has had an impact on my body (it must have had, right?). Specifically, I'm concerned that my cognitive abilities have been worsened, my lifespan will be reduced, and, uh, I'm worried that a lack of testosterone is giving me a really small penile size. That last thing admittedly feels silly to obsess over in conjunction to everything else but I'm 16 and I'm pretty sure I still have a micropenis, which is freaking me out.

in class, sometimes as i sit there, i cant keep my eyes open or hold my head up. there has been multiple instances where ive had my eyes closed or trying to keep them open mid conversation, or where ive simply fallen asleep while talking to someone. this can happen all throughout the day, even in my active classes like show choir and theatre, where sometimes ill stand in the corner and try to take a power nap. its gotten to the point where my teachers dont say anything. when i get home from school or practice, i immediately go to bed. if i shower, there have been times where i fall asleep with the water running. usually i dont eat dinner unless my mom forces me, but even then, i have a habit of falling asleep at the dinner table. 

weekends is where its the worst. friday night i can go to bed around 4:30pm, wake up at 8pm or 9pm to eat, then go straight back to bed until my mom wakes me up the next day. she can start to wake me up at 12pm, but since i keep falling asleep, i wont get up until 5pm. the cycle continues; i wake up at 5pm to eat, go back to bed, wake up the next day to do it all over. usually i get around 15 to 18 hours on weekends, if im not doing anything.

if nobody wakes me up, i can sleep for however long i want; one time over 22 hours. its like no matter how long i sleep, im never rested. i can go to bed anywhere, any time. most of the time, im happy, outgoing, energetic; no matter what im acting like, that sleepiness wipes right over me and ruins my mood. (its not like i suddenly fall asleep though, like most narcolepsy articles ive read. i dont think its like that, but what do i know lol)

ive tried alarms, they dont do anything. ive changed my ringtone, changed the vibrate pattern, slept in pitch black, slept with the lights on, with music, without music, etc. nothing i do seems to help. i dont get hungry and wake up to eat, i have to be forced. i dont get the urge to pee and wake up, again, i have to be forced. 

my family and friends all call me lazy, saying i just need to go to bed early. me and my boyfriend have gotten in countless arguments over me sleeping the day away. today was his birthday and i was only up for 3 hours out of the whole day

1q58gwy,Spontaneous Insomnia is making me afraid,"
Hi everyone,

I’m posting here because I’m really confused and worried about what’s been happening to my sleep over the last few days, and I’m looking for advice or similar experiences.

Background (english is not my primary language sorry )

I’m 25 years old, male.

I’ve always had very good sleep hygiene and usually slept 8–9 hours without issues.

No history of fatal insomnia or similar neurological diseases in my family.

I don’t take daily medication (I have ADHD but no treatment for a long time).

I was not stressed before all this started.

Everything began very suddenly.

---

Timeline of my recent nights

Night 1 – Spontaneous all-nighter
I went to bed like usual, no stress, no anxiety, no external trigger. I simply could not fall asleep at all. Zero sleep. This had never happened to me before.

Night 2 – About 5 hours, very fragmented
After New Year’s Eve (some alcohol but not drunk), I finally slept around 5 hours total, but I was waking up almost every hour. I could fall back asleep fairly quickly, but sleep felt very light.

Night 3 – Around 1 hour
Went to bed earlier, took melatonin. I think I slept about 1 hour, then woke up suddenly with my heart racing. After that, I couldn’t fall back asleep.

Night 4 – Again around 1 hour
Same pattern(except i took 2 drop of lysanxia 15mg/ml). Brief sleep of 1 hour, sudden awakening, strong alert feeling, no way to maintain sleep.

Night 5 – Very short fragmented blocks
That night I had several short sleep blocks (20–30 minutes, then another 20–30 minutes, then about 1 hour). Every time I drifted off, I’d wake up again.

Night 6 – Long night but extremely fragmented
I finally slept around 9 hours total, but I woke up every single hour. I could fall back asleep, but I never stayed asleep for long. I woke up feeling unrefreshed.

Night 7 – Back to short sleep
That night I slept in fragments again: a short period early in the night, then another short one, then about 1 hour in the early morning.

According to my Apple Watch this night :

Sleep is highly fragmented

REM sleep was about 1h40

Respiratory rate was higher than usual yet my heartbeat is nearly good tho i feel my heart pound like crazy...



---

What I notice

I can fall asleep, but I can’t maintain sleep.

I often wake up suddenly with a strong sense of alertness or heart pounding.

During the day, I feel strangely “awake” but mentally foggy and forgetful.

The anxiety mostly came after the sleep problems started, not before.



---

What I’ve tried

Melatonin → helps me get sleepy, but I still wake up after ~1 hour.

Metarelax → 4 pills a day

Sleepyl → before ""sleeping""

Sedistress plus → before ""sleeping'

Lysanxia (2 drop once) → mild calming effect, but didn’t fix the awakenings.

I’ve avoided heavy caffeine and screens late.



---

My questions

Has anyone experienced sudden, severe insomnia like this without prior stress or by the fact of being old ?

Can insomnia really start this abruptly at my age?

Does this sound like acute insomnia with hyperarousal, or something else?

Could the elevated nighttime respiratory rate be linked to frequent awakenings?

What helped you break this cycle?

1q56vg4,Any hope for lifelong sleep disorder*?,"\* not diagnosed, yet, but what the fuck else is it at this point

I've spent my entire teen and adult life so far (26yo) just trying to be able to feel *okay* day to day. After dozens of antidepressants/ADHD meds, therapy, an environment change, and addressing other stuff, I still feel horrible every day.

Some things are better, but I'm still *exhausted*, constantly. I'm just as tired when I wake up as I am when I go to bed, I can barely think through the brain fog, I have zero physical energy, and the crows feet/eye bags of a 200 year old. It doesn't matter if I sleep 2, 4, 8, 12 hours, or not at all, nothing changes.

And nothing has helped. I've tried melatonin (high and low doses), Benadryl, trazodone, and gabapentin (only one that really helped me fall asleep easier, but nothing for quality of sleep), as well as all the usual advice (no screens before bed, red lights, cool temperature, etc). 

I've been trying to get a sleep study done for 6 months now, and due to shitty life stuff along with a comical level of things not working out at the last minute for reasons beyond my control, I only now have a referral for a place I night actually be able to go to (that doesn't have great reviews, but I'll take what I can get.)

And like... I don't know what the fuck to do. I've been >! suicidal !< for the first time in years recently because it seems so hopeless. I can't live like this anymore.

I do. I feel absolutely terrible, as I don’t ever yell at him… that I know of. 
According to him, I do it when I’m in a very deep sleep stage of sleep, because when I’m in a light sleep stage, he says I’m back to being nice when he goes to wake me up. 
He says this only happens when I’m being woken up, so he gauges my sleep patterns so he knows when to wake me without getting him yelled at. 
This was told to me today because I asked him why he let me sleep so long, and he asked me if I remember him taking his cpap machine out of the room to sleep on the couch. 
I said no, and he proceeded to tell me that when he was trying to get me to scoot over to sleep too, that I screamed at him to get out and yelled a bunch of stuff that frankly, didn’t make ANY sense, then flopped back to being the dead log that I am when I sleep.

Over the last week i’ve been unable to consistently stay asleep for more than 3-4 hours each night and i’m forced into sleeping in 1 hour increments after that timeframe in order to get my full rest time in. 

Not a single thing has changed in my life to where this would warrant making any sense and it’s starting to really be detrimental as i’m already exhausted by 2-3pm each day and wanna be in bed well before I usually go to sleep. 

I’ve been a Night Owl for years and my body has adapted to that lifestyle with no issues - My consistent sleep schedule had me being in bed by 3-4am each night and I was more than able to get roughly 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep.

1q4z2w9,Weighted blanket has relieved my long-term insomnia,"That's it-- the weighted blanket has been a god-send and I kinda can't believe it works. Apparently, it doesn't work for everyone, but does for some. It's been 6 weeks since I got it and I'm getting consistent 8 hrs (or more) sleep most nights. It's not a perfect ""cure"" -- I still sometimes wake up 1x on occasional nights to use the bathroom, but not every night and I can easily fall back asleep. It's life-changing to get good sleep again! 

Context: Have had terrible insomnia for about 15 years and tried \*everything\* (Rx meds, supplements, dietary changes, reduced screen-time, breathing exercises, hypnosis, and more). Kinda gave up trying. I heard about weighted blankets over the years, but it seemed weird to me and I was very skeptical. I think the deep pressure makes your nervous system feel ""safe""... somehow? I don't understand the science, but it's compared to ""swaddling"" (a technique for calming babies and helping them sleep).

Decided to share my experience because this helped me so much and I hope it helps others-- so grateful to be able to sleep again!

Do your research before trying it, but the main thing I read online was to aim for a weighted blanket that is about 10% of your body weight. It's not a magic bullet-- my aunt who has insomnia said it didn't work for her-- but it clearly works for some. Good luck!",1767649361.0,15,11,sleep,sleep

Before getting married, living together felt pretty easy. We didn't notice much friction. But after marriage, it's like all these little habits suddenly became...louder? More noticeable? More annoying?

* Snoring (which I swear got worse 😅)
* Different sleep schedules
* Needing silence vs. needing some background sound
* Tossing and turning
* Even small things like breathing or shifting in bed

• When workouts were inconsistent or poorly timed, sleep quality also declined

What surprised me most was that trying to **optimize** just one rarely worked. Improving sleep without adjusting activity quickly hit a ceiling. Training harder without respecting sleep did the same.

Because I couldn’t find a clean way to view sleep and exercise together, I actually built a **comprehensive health app** for my own tracking needs. Seeing both side by side made the relationship much clearer - it’s not really cause and effect, but **interdependence**.

What stood out over time was that once I started balancing both instead of optimizing one, things finally **improved together**. Sleep became more consistent, and workouts felt more sustainable instead of draining.

1q4l9hi,What finally helped my insomnia wasn’t sleep advice,"I want to recommend a book that genuinely helped me with my insomnia:

How to Stop Worrying and Start Living by Dale Carnegie.

I originally picked it up for general anxiety, but I was surprised by how much it helped my sleep. Several chapters talk about people who struggled with insomnia and eventually learned how to sleep again. Reading those stories alone was reassuring.

There’s one chapter in particular called “How to Stop Worrying About Insomnia” that completely changed the way I think about sleep. Instead of fighting insomnia or fearing it, the book helped me relax my mindset around it, and that made a huge difference. 

I also paired that mindset shift with Soothfy at night for gentle routines and calming sounds which helped me stop treating bedtime like a battle

Over time, I was able to sleep again.

If your insomnia is fueled by worry, overthinking, or fear of not sleeping, this book might be worth checking out.",1767618568.0,5,2,sleep,sleep

It felt like I didn’t even have time to get to that stage but I was super tired so maybe I was wrong. Either way for some reason it made me have a panic attack like until I feel asleep. I woke up a couple times still having a panic attack, but eventually I slept through it. I think it just freaks me out not having control of my thought because I have ocd 🤦🏽‍♀️ and I have this fear I’ll go into psychosis or develop schizophrenia an. It’s like my mind is just blurting out random words and sentences to me constantly. For example last night I wondered what time my bf had to get up for work (changes day to day) and suddenly I thought ‘you have to get up at 530!’ And for a couple seconds it seemed normal then I realized I didn’t have to get up and go anywhere. Then next thing I know before I can finish thinking about how odd that thought was my brain is saying ‘the yellow banana is green on the wall today’ it seems normal for a few seconds, and then I repeat it a couple times before I realize it’s totally odd.

1q4k3ls,Sleep Might Be the Missing Piece in Your Weight Loss Puzzle,"Been thinking a lot about the link between sleep and weight management after reading about how sleep affects hunger hormones, appetite, and metabolic health. When we don’t get enough sleep our body’s regulation of leptin and ghrelin shifts in a way that just makes us hungrier and less full, which usually leads to eating more and craving junk food. 

Poor sleep also makes it harder to stay active because you’re tired all the time and your metabolism doesn’t work as well as it should. Quality sleep seems to help with appetite control, energy levels, and overall weight regulation. I’ve been on GLP1 via shemed for a while now to lose weight and it’s helped with appetite and consistency. 

But I can still tell on weeks where I sleep poorly everything feels harder. My cravings are worse, I’m more tired at the gym, and it feels like the scale stalls even when I’m doing everything “right.” Curious how many people here have noticed sleep making a real difference in their weight loss journey despite other tools and meds they’re using.",1767615117.0,1,3,sleep,sleep

1q4iiyh,How to stop quick but vivid scary dreams as your falling asleep?,"I am getting anxiety about sleep because of the dreams I have when going to sleep. 
When I fall asleep I feel like immediately start dreaming lately. And it always takes place in the area where I am asleep and they are quick but unsettling

I have two most recent examples- I am on the  couch watching a show my oldest kid is asleep in his room and my partner and daughter are asleep in the other room, I hear my daughter walking out of the room and she comes to me crying saying there is a scary noise outside, I hear the noise to go look out my window and it's been pried open and then when I turn around it's completely dark in my house and the noise gets louder to where I have to cover my ears with my hands.

Then I woke up, I didn't even feel myself fall asleep and by the show I was watching it took place in a period of about 8 mins as I was still in the same episode
.
Another more recent one involves the same situation where I was in the living room while everyone else slept in the house, except this time I was actually resting my eyes, then I once again heard a noise coming from the hall way and my oldest son walks out but his face is very distorted and I'm terrified  as he sit across from me and stared at me I'm trying to make sense of it and then I woke up, and once again it had only been like 5 mins from the time. I dozed off to the dream to the wake up. 

Sometimes I  even feel like I say my partners name or help or something, but last time it happened when I was on the bed and I was so sure I had been saying his name he told me I was completely still until I woke up. The dreams also feel more like... A extension of my day? Like sometimes when I come out of it, I barely recognize it was a dream because it didn't even feel like I fell a sleep and it's literally been a few mins. Always less than 15 mins but it's more like 5-10 mins of sleep.  Like I'm just sitting there and some scary thing happens and then I wake up without even realizing I was asleep. 

Those are just the two most recent examples but it's truly driving me mad and making it harder for me to want to sleep without feeling anxious.

1q4icm6,"Getting to sleep is fine, staying asleep, less so","I am really hoping someone has a solution to this, but this is something that’s gotten worse over time. I have very few issues getting to sleep, I’m more than aware my phone usage is the issue and I’m getting better about it. I can now get to sleep before 10pm.

My main issue is staying asleep. As soon as I’ve had my 30 minutes of deep sleep a night (I never seem to be able to get more than that) I will then wake up every 10 to 30 minutes, be awake for 10 minutes and then get back to sleep. It really messes with my sleep cycle.

I’m having so many interruptions I’m spending 11 hours in bed and only sleeping for 6 of them.

No amount of exercise fixes this, no amount of activity during the day helps. Mindfulness can go in the bin. I already avoid coffee and big meals. There’s no particular sound or sensation waking me up. I just can’t stay asleep no matter how exhausted I am.

This makes it so much harder to get up out of bed because I’m not rested.

I take a handful of vitamin and mineral supplements, 27, IS, on an opioid based painkiller which you think would help. I have autism, ADHD, CFS/ME, EDS, and PoTS/VVS. All of which could be contributing.

1q4g39l,"Why Did My ""Old And Worse"" Sleep Schedule Feel Better?","Ok so some background, for the past 2 years or so I have had wwhat most would call horrible sleep. I would sleep at 11pm-1am, sometimes 2am on school/weekdays and wake up at 6am for school. I would often times fall asleep in the car and in classes. On weekends, I would sleep at anywhere from 1am-4am and wake up with no alarm which is usually 11am - 2pm sometimes. As u can probably tell, this was a pretty bad schedule so now that I am done with school and am taking a gap semester, I decided to tackle my long term poor sleep.

First 2 weeks:  
I slowly adjusted sleep time to fall around 12.30-1am, not early by any means but wway earlier than my 4am nights. I then slowly set and reached a fix time to wake up at 9.15am. So around 8hrs of sleep. I then realized I probably needed more sleep then 8hrs cuz i was feeling tired asf, and wwas struggling to wake up to my alarm

Past 4 weeks:  
In the past month or so roughly, I slept the same time but pushed wake up to 10.15am, after a week of testing my natural wakeup, where I naturally woke around this time. So I locked in here, expecting good sleep results, but it didnt play out that way.

What was ""wrong""?  
Essentially in the past 4 weeks, i often had trouble falling asleep, woke up at least once every night in the middle of the night and wake up feeling like I hadn't even slept at all. Like a ""seamless"" transition. I also had frequent vivid dreams for a while but they died down now. Anyways, none of this happened on my old schedule where I felt like sleep was actually something I craved. Now I still feel tired in the mornings and only awake at night. idk what i am doing wrong. I dont think i have sleep apnea cuz i dont snore so idk.

TLDR: Consistent sleep of 9hrs, from 1-10.15am, not bringing benefits expected and feels worse than previous schedule, wonder what is missing. Feeling foggy, flat and unmotivated most of the day now",1767600868.0,1,0,sleep,sleep

1q4eqdy,Was given a different sleep medication & need help identifying last given meds.,"Hello fellow sleep enthusiasts.

I got prescribed zopiclone and it did nothing, then trazodone and that one was 50/50 efficiency, so I told the new doc I wanted mor eof the last one prescribed because I couldn't remember the name (empty pill bottle was at home, actuall all of them where still at home).
Turns out she prescribed the old one that *hadn't work before* (at all, 2 weeks tryout) by mistake. But they looked completely different (beige/yellow and diamond shaped (the playing card type)) and they worked. Much better than any before.

Well I've ran out over the holidays and was too sick to go to the doc. I'm a bit better but didn't want to go sit in a clinic full of sick people. Instead, I called my pharmacy (they have an automated system) to have them fax my doc.

My doc has been unreliable somewhat, so I so I went to my pharmacy to advance me a few (2) zopiclines while my doc will thinks about replying to their fax request for more. They did, but didn't look like the ones I have been taking at all, these are oblong and blue (7.5mg).

I felt crazy trying to ask why they looked different. They said they were tge same as last time.

I've tried them anyway but I don't feel like my body is heavy and drowsy as it usually does, so I'm thinking it's the same ones!

Is there a clone brand that looks different? Do any of you know which ones, zopiclone, maybe even trazodone, or a clone of either, has that yellow/beige diamond shaped pill? I remember it was hard to split in half so there might not have been a divider in the middle either.

Thank you so much. Sleep has been much better (finally!) since.

1q461im,How a 3 AM vet emergency gave me the best rest I’ve had in years,"Last night, I thought my sleep schedule was going to be completely ruined.

My cat suffered a severe injury (tail degloving) in the middle of the night. I had to rush him to the emergency vet at 3:00 AM. I spent a good chunk of the night at the clinic and knew I had to go back at 8:00 AM for follow-ups.

I managed to get back home in between visits and decided to try and close my eyes for the remaining few hours, fully expecting to wake up feeling like a zombie.

The unexpected result:

I woke up at 7:30 AM feeling incredibly refreshed. Better than I usually feel after a full, uninterrupted 8-hour night. My mind was clear, my energy was high, and I didn't have that usual morning grogginess.

I realized I had accidentally recreated the ""Segmented Sleep"" (or biphasic sleep) pattern that our ancestors used to follow before the invention of electric lighting. They would have a ""first sleep,"" wake up for an hour or two (to pray, tend to animals, or socialize), and then have a ""second sleep.""

1q4543e,Chronic sleep maintenance insomnia looking for guidance on meds and alternatives,"Hi everyone, I’m a 25-year-old male dealing with ongoing insomnia, primarily difficulty staying asleep, and I’m looking for guidance or shared experiences. Insomnia runs in my family, especially issues with sleep maintenance rather than sleep onset. I’m currently taking 25 mg sertraline, which I may switch to Lexapro soon with my psychiatrist. My main issue is that I fall asleep but wake up repeatedly or too early and can’t get back to sleep. This isn’t driven by anxiety right now—I just cannot stay asleep.

For context, mirtazapine 15 mg used to help but no longer works, so I’m exploring other options. I’m currently considering trazodone or low-dose doxepin as short-term options, and possibly Dayvigo, ramelteon, or something more natural like CBN. I already take melatonin (both immediate-release and extended-release) and magnesium, but they don’t seem to be enough anymore. I’ve attached my Oura sleep data from the past two nights, which shows fragmented sleep and poor continuity.

I also want to be clear that I’m trying to avoid benzodiazepines and Z-drugs (like Ambien or Lunesta). Lifestyle-wise, I’ve made significant changes: I used to smoke weed but gave it up, I no longer drink alcohol, and I barely consume caffeine at all—mostly just water. Despite this, my sleep quality hasn’t improved. I’m really just trying to get my sleep back on track and would appreciate any insight into medication choices, supplements, behavioral strategies, or alternatives that have helped others with similar sleep maintenance insomnia.

Thanks in advance for any advice or experiences you’re willing to share.

1q44w4l,Sunosi for focus and performance? Adult ADHD Inattentive type. Anyone take performance enhancing meds for work?,"I have always dealt with what I think is regular ADD or Inattentive ADHD where I just cannot seem to stay on a single task without the urge to check another tab or distract myself after a 10 minute sprint.

The biggest issue is that I feel completely lethargic every single morning even if I get a full eight hours of sleep. It feels like my brain takes forever to boot up and I have to play life on hard mode just to get the basic stuff done. I have been looking into Sunosi as an alternative to the usual stimulants because I want something that feels cleaner.

* For those of you with inattentive symptoms, did Sunosi actually help you stop the constant task switching and keep you focused on one thing?
* Does it actually fix that heavy morning lethargy or does it just make you feel awake while your brain still feels scattered?

1q44qml,I want a good sleep schedule but I keep avoiding going to bed for no reason (18M),"I really want to sleep early and wake up early, but I can’t get myself to actually go to bed.

The weird part is that I can fall asleep pretty fast sometimes. It’s not really insomnia. I just don’t want to stop whatever I’m doing and get into bed. Even when I am in bed, I end up watching YouTube or scrolling because just laying there feels boring or uncomfortable.

It feels like my brain would rather do literally anything else than sit in bed and sleep, even though I know I’d feel better the next day if I slept earlier. I’ll delay it over and over, then regret it the next morning... or shall i say the afternoon, since I usually wake up around 12 or 1pm and half my day is already gone.

I think a big part of it is loneliness, even though I have a girlfriend. Going to bed means being alone in my room with my thoughts, and that just feels kind of sad. I’ve tried the usual routine advice and it never really sticks, so I’m not really looking for generic tips.

I don’t know if this is procrastination, avoidance, or something else, but it’s frustrating because I actually want a good sleep schedule. Does anyone else deal with this mental block around going to bed, especially when it’s tied to feeling lonely?

1q3zy8n,Shaking while asleep,"I wasn’t sure if this was the right subreddit but I can’t find anywhere else to post this. Something extremely weird just happened. I was still asleep but not completely unconscious, I was waking up and knew what was going on but not fully awake just yet. I was having a dream and then suddenly I just started shaking like crazy. It was mostly my neck/head. I tensed up and just started shaking extremely fast and, though I knew it was happening and could feel it (it hurt), I couldn’t stop it. I couldn’t open my eyes, either. It felt like it went on for maybe two minutes, and then it just stopped and I immediately fully woke up, opening my eyes and everything. Now that I’m awake, the left side of my neck and upper left shoulder feel extremely sore (I could feel that side specifically tensing up a lot during the shaking). This has NEVER happened before, can anyone tell me what may have happened ?

I do have epilepsy, but I haven’t had a seizure in years and if this WAS a seizure, I want to clarify that this didn’t feel like any seizure I’ve ever had in my life. Even when I’ve had ‘small’ seizures where I didn’t go completely unconscious/fall to the floor shaking, they were not like this. When I’ve had smalls seizures in the past, I never shook. They were more like small black outs, to others it would look like I zoned out, to me it was like I just stopped existing for a minute or two and then came back very confused. But I felt nothing physically, I had no idea what was happening during those moments. No pain, no ‘trying to get myself out of it’ because I simply didn’t know I was ever even out of it until after the fact. When I’ve had grand mal seizures, I obviously did shake and tense up like crazy but I’ve ALWAYS gone completely unconscious when I’ve gotten those, I can’t feel anything actually in the moment, I’m just not there at all. Once again, no pain and no ‘trying to get myself out of it’. The only time I can actually feel anything from a grand mal seizure is directly before it happens, I can TELL that it’s coming but there’s nothing really I can do about it. During moments like those, where I can tell it’s coming before it actually happens, I’m fully conscious and aware of what’s going on but I do not shake and never have.. because I’m not actually having a seizure yet, I just feel it coming. Also, when I have grand mal seizures I have always peed myself. Every single time. Gross, I know, but it’s nothing I can control. That’s kind of a way I’ve been able to tell whether or not I’ve had a seizure in my sleep - I’ll check if that’s happened. I checked right after I fully woke up today and there was nothing. This didn’t feel like a seizure at all, but I guess it could’ve been. I’ve just never been conscious for one before to the point where I can actually feel my body shaking and tensing up or even just hearing things around me (the tv & the ac unit).

I actively have to fight to stay awake, I'll be so sleepy it's as if I've been drugged with a tranquilizer.

If I stay awake (I want to fix my sleep & go to bed around 9 instead of later), once it hits 8/9PM it's like a switch flips & I'm suddenly not sleepy at all & I'm still wide awake until around 2AM. Then of course I feel terrible in the morning because I didn't get enough sleep.

For example, I might wake up around 8am, but I need a nap around noon, and I'm desperately tired if I'm not asleep by 2pm. Then, I sleep usually around 3-4 hours, so I'm up by 6pm. Then I go to bed for the night at around 8pm or 9pm. I can't go any later than that.

1q3i01n,"Chronic sleep anxiety, I’m terrified of not sleeping and it’s slowly breaking me","Hello! Today I want to share something that has been weighing on me for years, something I’ve carried quietly for a long time.

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve had problems with sleep. Sometimes I was scared I wouldn’t be able to fall asleep at all, sometimes I didn’t even know why I was anxious, I just was. Things were manageable for a while, but everything changed when I turned 19, back in 2022.

I had to attend a university that was 75 km away from home. That meant waking up early, sleeping early, something my body had never learned how to do. I was used to sleeping late, usually after midnight. Every day, I had to take the first train at 6:50 a.m. just to make it to my 8 a.m. class.

That’s when the anxiety really started. Every night, my thoughts would spiral ""what if I don’t wake up? What if I miss the train? What if I stop attending classes and ruin my academic path? (I ruined it at the end and graduated with 2.0 GPA) 

I started counting the hours left until morning. When I realized I only have four or five hours to sleep, my chest felt heavy. I already knew the next day would be miserable, exhausting, uncomfortable, and that thought alone kept me awake even longer.

Eventually, I broke. I stopped attending classes regularly. I would arrive at university at 11 a.m. or later, or not go at all. Sometimes I had exams and went in on one or two hours of sleep, barely functioning, just trying to survive. The moment I knew I wouldn’t sleep enough, the anxiety became unbearable.

Year after year, the same cycle repeated. The only time I ever felt peace was on weekends or days off. Knowing that I didn’t have to wake up early, knowing I could sleep eight hours no matter what, those were the only nights I slept calmly.

I tried to fix my schedule. I tried sleeping early. But I just couldn’t. Sleeping at 10 p.m. feels impossible to me. My body treats 10 p.m. like it’s 6 p.m. Even when I do manage to sleep early, I wake up around midnight or 1 a.m. for no reason at all.

Then I started working.

With work came responsibility, and everything got worse. I found myself going to work on three or four hours of sleep, completely drained. It was exhausting beyond words. Thankfully, it was part-time, so I could sacrifice some days and recover on others, but even then, the problem never really went away.

I tried supplements. I tried everything I could think of. Nothing worked.

When the anxiety got really bad, I tried to calm myself. I’d whisper to myself ""Everything is going to be okay. You don’t deserve this pain.Tomorrow we’ll see a doctor, they’ll help you sleep""

But now, even that doesn’t help anymore.

I’ve never visited a sleep specialist. I’m scared scared of becoming dependent on medication just to sleep. For the past four years, I’ve been living with depression, and that only made everything worse.

Now, last month, I started a new 9–5 job. And honestly, I feel like I’m on the edge of losing my mind.

It’s the same nightmare all over again.

I go to bed at 11 p.m., but I don’t fall asleep until 2 or 3 a.m. Then I wake up at 6 a.m. I count the hours every night, four hours, sometimes less. Always the same number.

I’m scared something bad will happen to my health. I’m scared of heart disease, of my body giving up on me. The worst sleep always comes when I have something important the next morning, an exam, work, any responsibility. When I know I have to wake up early, I know I’m going to suffer that night.

This has deeply affected my life. It has cost me so much my peace, my confidence, my future plans. I feel like I’ve been paying the price for something I don’t know how to fix.

1q3dhr8,I don’t know…,"


17M. I just feel very emotionally numb. On top of sleep apnea i have insomnia caused by anxiety which, in turn, is probably caused by sleep apnea. I’ve gotten a tonsillectomy and a follow up sleep test after I was initially diagnosed with sleep apnea, but despite the follow up test saying I don’t have sleep apnea or UARS, I think it’s pretty evident that I still do. There were times where I’d wake up having a panic attack, and there was even a time where I had a dream where I couldn’t breathe and then woke up gagging. I got my tonsillectomy in January and my follow up test in May. I’ve had this since I was 13 and the effect it’s had on my genitals is driving me crazy. And then I maladaptive daydream all the time and the scenarios my mind conjures or the embarrassing moments I rerun are driving me crazy and I wonder how the additional stress is effecting my health. 
I have a follow up appointment the 15th.
It should’ve been much sooner but I’m still a minor and thus can’t schedule appointments without my parents. I tried not to step on my mother’s toes but fuck. I feel like I’m decaying. It shouldn’t have taken 8 months to finally go back to some sort of doctors though.

And 2 other things:

- im scared if I get a cpap mask it won’t work 

- the doctors said my tongue being so big is probably the reason why I have sleep apnea. They however didn’t point out my tongue tie while they were inspecting my mouth.

1q30nnl,Need help understanding what's going on,"I am growing a bit concerned about changes to the way I am sleeping (42M).

First, at some point over the last year, or few years I started to develop a weird pattern when I would fall asleep at night.  

I would get tired, fall asleep but spend about 1-1.5 hours cycling between awake and dreaming.  It doesn't feel like I am going from asleep to awake, simply from vivid dreams that feel real, to being aware that I am not asleep, not actually a feeling of waking up.  Nights that this happens it's a very predictable cycle and my Fitbit captures the wake ups perfectly.

I started to work more on my sleep hygiene.  I have ADHD and became convinced this was related to that.  The nights when it happens are nights where I am doing something to generate a cognitive load, like a video game or exciting movie.  After I would stop I would rapidly get sleepy but if I went to sleep this would almost certainly occur.

BUT, last night something very different happened and it's got me shaken a little. 

I fell asleep and I was asleep for probably 1-1.5 hours and then I ""woke up"".  I guess the way to explain it is that I became conscious, but it was like 2 different things in my brain.  I was aware I was awake but my thoughts were racing, jumping and fractured all over the place.  It was uncomfortable.  I spend a bit of time trying to interrupt and slow that down, but I couldn't.  So I decided, since reading slows my mind down, maybe if I read my e-reader for a few minutes that would help.  

I grabbed my e-reader and at first it was like the words were fuzzy, but then I could see the words.  I knew they were words, I could tell the different words apart but I couldn't read.  Not sure if that makes sense.

Anyway after that I laid on my back, and somehow managed to drift back to sleep.  I don't remember if the speed of thoughts ever changed. 

Lastly it felt like the whole thing lasted about 2 hours, but my Fitbit shows about 10-15 minutes.  ",1767461752.0,1,0,sleep,sleep
1q301f2,Freaking out,"Background- 26 year old. I use nicotine (juul), pretty heavy user. Lately as I’m falling asleep my hand or hands will start trembling and tingling. This trembling is visible it’s not an internal sensation. I can sometimes feel my hand shake against my face because I feel with my hand touching my face. It feels like an adrenaline rush and sometimes like a warm rush too. sort of like  the way your hands would shake if you were in fear/danger. And then I fall asleep. It’s been happening maybe a few times a week for the last 2/3 months but I feel like it’s been more frequent lately. What is this? I’m not sure if this could be hypnic jerks because it’s not jerking.

1q2mhgf,Interesting Anomaly: High Deep Sleep Ratio (34%) and Severe Sleep Irregularity (DSPD?) - Is there a connection?,"**Deep Sleep Ratio Issue:** I did some research and found that a normal deep sleep ratio is usually 15-25%. However, my smartwatch statistics for the entire year of 2025 show that **my average deep sleep is 34%**. I haven't found any information online about having such a *high* ratio. I asked AI about it, and it suggested it might be a genetic advantage for recovery, but given my other sleep issues, I'm skeptical.

**The Core Problem: Sleep Irregularity (Delayed Sleep Phase)** I’m 24 and have struggled with sleep irregularity my whole life. I used to be forced out of bed by my parents until university. Now, as a student at a top university with decent achievements, I feel like I can't order my life because the rest of the world runs on a 9-to-5 schedule. I feel overwhelmed trying to fix this.

**The Deceptive Stats:**

* **Average Sleep Duration:** 7hr 37min (data from 2025).
* **The Reality:** Looking at the average, it seems I have no problem. I generally sleep 7+ hours, so I don't suffer from insomnia. **The problem is the volatility.** My sleep schedule shifts constantly (free-running rhythm). Because of this shifting awake time, some days I sleep a standard 7 hours, but other days my body ""crashes"" and I sleep for 15 hours to recover. Mathematically it averages to 7.5 hours, but functionally, I have no stability or solid wake-up time.

**Psychiatry & Melatonin:** I saw a psychiatrist for the first time last month. After just 15 minutes(LOL), she said, ""I believe depression is the root cause, and sleep issues are just a symptom."" While I do have some signs of depression, I believe they are caused *by* my sleep schedule, so I declined antidepressants for now. I want to fix my sleep first. She prescribed **3 mg of melatonin**, but I've read that this dosage is unnecessarily high for circadian rhythm shifting (chronotherapy). I plan to switch to **0.5 mg** to treat what I believe is Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder (DSPD).

**Additional Context:**

* **Fitness:** Started fitness and tracking sleep last year; it helped stability slightly but didn't solve the problem.
* **Habits:** I struggle with screen addiction but try to maintain a blue-light routine.
* **Health:** I've had chronic migraines since age 9 (3-4 attacks a month, sleep is the only cure). My family also has a history of migraines. I've always been prone to getting sick easily.
* **Alarm:** I am advanced at using Tech. So I f\*cking know everyway to block turning of that alarm programs, despite those limitations like taking photo etc.

I still have six more months until I'm done with my bachelor and I'm starting to feel the whole ""I might not be good enough to get a job"", even if I'm in a field that has an okay job market. 

Through these years of studying I have started to develop an issue where I convince myself I'm not good enough and that no one will want to hire me. When I started three years ago I was always thinking something like ""fuck it I know i can do this, and who gives a shit if it goes to shit?"", but I have gradually developed anxiety about school and post-graduation stuff.

The night before last exam I couldn't sleep more than 1 hour, and I drove myself absolutely mental during the night, all for nothing since i got a B+. 

Anyways, today I had som panic at first, not being able to sleep. So I instead made plans that this year I will do something fun every single day in order to reward myself and working on my slowly growing mental health issues.

I think it will be good for my brain, as I can just sit in silence with something finicky and a cup of tea for a couple of hours every now and then, for my sanity. 

I am proud to say that I'm working on myself and my mental health, and that this will be the year that I try to take care of myself. No anxiety from bot being able to sleep tonight, as it is what it is.

1q2gl0k,Fixing circadian rhythm when I'm falling to sleep to early/at random,"Tl;Dr: (probably) broken circadian rhythm tries to send me to sleep at random times, sometimes as early as 5-6pm when I'm still at work or on the way home. Missing that hour renders me unable to find rest for that day. Found a hotfix (legal marijuana) but not a cure, and looking for people that had similar problems and found a real solution (or something inconspicuous that is causing this randomness) that might not be in the books but worked out for them. 

--- 

Long story: As far as I can remember, I have like 30 minutes to one hour each day where I'm getting really tired, and during that time I don't need more than a couple of minutes to fall asleep and get the 7-9 hours of sleep my body seems to need that day. 

The problem is that when I fail to fall asleep during that time, my brain switches in some hyper awoken state that makes me unable to rest until it's like 3am and I'm totally exhausted and only end up with 3 hours of sleep before I have to get up again for work.

This leads to a chain reaction where I'm tired the whole day and immensely focused during the evening and night, and it takes time to get back into a normal sleep schedule. I can shorten that up with staying awake the whole night and next day so I'm definitely exhausted in the next evening, but staying awake for like 36 hours was definitely easier in my early 20s, and doing that 2-3 times a month is no longer an option once you hit 30.

The thing that makes it worse is that even without acute sleep problems, this time frame shifts around randomly during the evening. When it comes after 6:30pm it's fine, might be a bit annoying because I'll wake up too early but still get a whole night of rest. When it's before that I'm still at work or on the way home and know that this night will be shitty. 

I tried all the things that are recommended. I switched all soft drinks, caffeinated drinks, coffee and alcohol with water, I switched screen time with music and audio books, completely darkened my bedroom and walk by foot to get more sunlight, but as long as my circadian rhythm is broken and tries to send me asleep at random times I'm fucked.

The only thing working for me right now is when I started taking (legal) marijuana on those days, which avoids the whole cycle and allows me to get tired at the right time. But this is a bandaid solution, not a cure, and it is well known that weed is also a burden on sleep quality.

Did anybody else have problems with his internal rhythm being totally random, and what he had to do or leave out to get a normal sleep rhythm?

1q2fb29,"I can’t wake up from alarms, I function normally on very little sleep, but can sleep 10-14 hours and feel worse, has anyone experienced this?","I’ve (M) (19) been dealing with a serious and increasingly frustrating sleep issue for the past two to three years, and I’m hoping to hear from others who may have experienced something similar.

No matter what kind of alarm I use, loud sounds, vibration, multiple alarms, different apps. I turn them off while still asleep. Even when I place my phone on the other side of the room, I somehow get up, turn it off, and go back to bed without any memory of doing so. From my perspective, it feels like I never woke up at all.

What’s even stranger is that when someone tries to wake me up, I can respond, talk, and even hold a short conversation, but later I remember absolutely nothing. People tell me I sounded awake, yet my mind was clearly not conscious. It’s like my body is functioning on autopilot while my awareness is completely offline.

I usually only wake up naturally after 10-14 hours of sleep, which feels extreme. What’s worse is that when I sleep that long, I don’t feel rested, I feel heavy, groggy, mentally foggy, and sometimes even worse than if I had slept less. If I try to wake up earlier, the only thing that works is physical force, such as someone pulling me out of bed. Even then, I barely register what’s happening. Loud noises, bright lights, or even water don’t reliably wake me up.

At the same time, here’s the part that really confuses me: when I sleep only 4-6 hours, I often function surprisingly well. I can think clearly, work, study, and feel relatively normal during the day. This happens regardless of when I sleep, at night, during the day, or in the evening. The issue seems completely independent of my sleep schedule, location, or environment. No matter where I am or how I sleep, the same pattern repeats.

I actively try to improve my sleep quality. I always keep fresh air in my room, avoid extreme temperatures, and make an effort to create the best possible sleep conditions. Despite that, I frequently sleepwalk, talk in my sleep almost every night, and sometimes even walk around without remembering it the next day.

This all started about 2-3 years ago and has been getting progressively worse. Before that, I could wake up instantly to any alarm, no matter how little I slept. I was the type of person who could get up sharply and function right away. Now, it feels like the complete opposite waking up has become the hardest part of my day.

For context, I’m a civil engineering student and I also work around 30-40 hours a week in an online casino. My schedule can be demanding, but this sleep issue exists regardless of workload or stress levels. Even during calmer periods, the problem remains.

I’m not trying to self-diagnose or jump to conclusions. I’m simply trying to understand whether others have experienced something like this extreme difficulty waking up, functioning better on short sleep than long sleep, and having no memory of alarms or conversations.

For the past month ive been terrified to sleep due to hating the feeling of non-awareness, and also the fear of not sleeping enough to the point I've been scared to go see my gf or friends in the case that im agitated or too emotional. 

Everytime I feel myself drift off I wake up in sweats and a fast heartbeat, and im scared that sleep might not feel instantaneous.

1q29rum,Is this sleep paralysis or something else? All thoughts and insight appreciated,"I’m not sure if I’ve ever had sleep paralysis before, which is what I originally considered these episodes to be. They started about four years ago and have only gotten worse, the past few months it has been nearly every day. I'm 21F and have never been diagnosed with any sleep disorders, but both my parents have sleep apnea. Not sure if that's important.

These episodes only happen when I wake up in the middle of the night and roll over to go back to sleep, or when I wake up in the morning and go back to sleep. It starts as I'm falling asleep. I start hearing this buzzing, static-like sound in my ears that lasts for a couple seconds but gets increasingly louder and louder. Along with this, my body feels like its sinking into the bed, and this buzzing sensation crawls up from my feet all the way to my head. Now, I've learned that if I force myself to open my eyes or move, it stops. But, if I let it get all the way to my head, the static sound in my ears gets VERY loud and I head a ""POP"", then my body is fully paralyzed, and I feel like I'm falling through the bed. At this point, I open my eyes, and everything is as it normally is. It just scares me because I can also see my body laying on the bed underneath me. Everything gets super fuzzy, I feel like I'm drunk, and at this point I usually get really scared and lay back down, trying to ""get back into my body"" if you will, and I eventually am able to wake myself up with enough yelling, screaming, and flailing around. But I'm not actually moving at all until I'm fully awake.

I've heard of astral projection which I'm aware this is what that sounds like, but I'm not sure if I believe in that or not, if this is some cruel sleep paralysis hallucination, or some weird recurring nightmare. Or a sleep disorder I'm not aware of. Has anyone else had similar experiences or know of anything?

1q22cqc,finally helped you fix your sleep schedule after years of inconsistency?,"For anyone who struggles with sleep inconsistency, here’s what finally worked for me.

I found my own version of counting sheep. I pick a pop culture universe like a TV show, comic, or book and imagine each character as if they were in a fighting game like Marvel vs. Capcom. I mentally assign their basic moves, special moves, directional attacks, and ultimates. By the time I get through a full cast of characters, I’m usually asleep.

I started reading hard sci-fi before bed. It’s interesting enough to hold my attention but not so gripping that I fight sleep. I’m fine falling asleep mid-page and picking it up again later without losing my place. Long series work especially well because there’s no pressure to “finish.”

I got a smartwatch to track my sleep, heart rate, and oxygen levels. These devices aren’t perfect, but they gave me useful patterns and feedback instead of guessing.

I built a nighttime routine that actually fits my schedule and that I do consistently. I take a magnesium bath, read, and drink water for about an hour. Then I do my nighttime skincare routine and take my anxiety medication and melatonin.

One of the biggest issues I discovered was that my body was stuck in a constant stress state at bedtime. Anxiety was keeping my nervous system activated. After talking with my doctor, I started buspirone, and it made a noticeable difference for me.

I started moving my body more during the day. I aim for around 10,000 steps daily, lift weights in the morning four days a week, and do yoga three days a week.

I spend time in the sun first thing in the morning and avoid anything stimulating after a set time at night. Nothing exciting, nothing upsetting, only calming activities. I also avoid screens for several hours before bed. For me, it wasn’t just about blue light, but about the low-grade mental stimulation from scrolling and thinking.

I stopped eating after 5 PM, which made a big difference. On days I stop eating even earlier, around 3 PM, my sleep is even better. I usually fall asleep around 9 PM since I wake up at 5 AM.

On non-work days, I still get up at the same time, but I’m more flexible with how I spend the day, whether that’s walking, gardening, DIY projects, or exercise.

Finally, I listen to my body and take rest days when I need them instead of forcing myself through exhaustion.  I started using Soothfy App in a similar way. It gives me simple daily anchor activities and rotates small novelty elements so my brain doesn’t shut down or resist. It’s not a cure or a replacement for treatment, but it helps me stay regulated enough to keep going on harder days.

I’m looking for advice or shared experiences because I’m stuck in a frustrating sleep cycle.

# Background (what started this)

Around **mid-September**, I suddenly started having daily episodes of:

* Rapid heartbeat
* High blood pressure
* Giddiness, confusion, feeling “out of control”

I went to the ER. **All tests were normal.**

# Initial treatment

My doctor started me on:

* **Propranolol ER 20 mg (morning)**
* **Flupentixol 0.5 mg (morning)**
* **Clonazepam 0.5 mg (night)**

These episodes stopped completely. Over time, I only felt mild giddiness.

# Clonazepam taper

I took clonazepam for \~**45 days**:

* 0.5 mg for 2 weeks
* 0.25 mg for 2 weeks
* Then tapered off gradually

About **7 days after stopping**, I developed **insomnia**.

# First insomnia phase

Doctor prescribed **mirtazapine 7.5 mg** for **4 days**:

* It helped
* I stopped it
* I also stopped **flupentixol** a few days later

# Relapse

About **3 weeks after stopping everything**, sleep problems returned.  
For **4–5 days**, I slept only **2–3 hours per night**.

Things I tried:

* **Melatonin** → didn’t help
* **Trazodone 12.5 mg (1 night)** → made things worse

# Current situation (main problem)

For the **last 4 days**, I’ve been taking **mirtazapine 7.5 mg nightly**, but:

* I fall asleep fine
* **Wake up after 2–3 hours feeling fully awake**
* Can’t fall back asleep
* Any later sleep feels **very light**, almost like **lucid dreaming while awake**

The first 2–3 hours feel like **good sleep**, but after that it’s like a switch flips.

I had brief episodes of feeling on edge, giddiness and confusion twice, and once I took 0.125 mg clonazepam. 

# How I feel

* I don’t feel too exhausted during the day, but worried about getting such less sleep everyday. 
* I’m starting to think the **September episode may have been triggered by poor sleep in the first place**

# My questions

1. Has anyone experienced **waking up fully alert after 2–3 hours** like this?
2. Should I **give mirtazapine more time**, or does this mean it won’t work for me?
3. Is restarting **clonazepam** a bad idea in this situation?
4. Could this be **withdrawal / rebound insomnia** even weeks later?

It doesn't really bother me more than the mere existence of an inner monologue usually does, but I'm really curious if anyone else has had a similar experience? Is this an ADHD thing or do neurotypical people get it too? Any and all replies are welcome",1767329949.0,1,1,sleep,sleep

1q1o3yk,The thing that actually improved my sleep wasn’t better meditations... it was timing,"I tried a lot of sleep advice: breathing exercises, body scans, guided meditations, podcasts.

Most of them worked sometimes and failed other times. The biggest issue wasn’t technique, it was timing. When my mind was already racing, long audio made it worse. When I was exhausted, instructions felt annoying.

What helped was having very short interventions and knowing when _not_ to do anything. Sometimes it was just sitting in the dark for two minutes. Sometimes a brief grounding exercise.

I still occasionally use Calm for its wind-downs and Insight Timer. I’ve also tried a few newer, more interactive tools like Thinking Me and some others that meet you where you are emotionally instead of assuming you’re already relaxed. They let you describe what’s going on in the moment rather than forcing a script.

Nothing is a magic cure-all, but figuring out when to intervene (or not) has mattered way more than perfecting the how. Anyone else find that timing is the real game-changer?

My heart starts pounding, mind starts racing about nothing important, and suddenly I'm wide awake like I just got bad news.

This has been going on since September now and I've tried everything. Melatonin (stopped working). Magnesium was useless and I had sleep hygiene to a T. Cut out alcohol, caffeine after lunch, got blackout curtains, white noise machine, the whole nine yards. My doctor gave me Ambien and it worked for maybe 5 nights before my body said ""nope, not anymore.""

Here's what I can't figure out: I don't think I have a sleep problem. I think my nervous system is just stuck in overdrive and treats bedtime like some kind of emergency. The harder I try to fix it, I feel like the worse the dread gets about the whole thing.

1q1izjn,"I just witnessed my soul being detached from my body, and it scared the heck out of me.","I went to sleep at an earlier time than usual—around 7 PM. I never intended to, but I forced myself to get to bed since I want to have an excuse to avoid drinking with my cousins and aunt (I am 18 years old, and reluctant to drink alcohol).

Also, take note: I tend to sleep late often since I do not want to find myself awakened at the middle of the night just to sleep again and get nightmares.

Anyway, as I was saying. I slept earlier. Then, I found myself waking up at 12 AM. I was frustrated to go back to bed because I was so afraid to wake up distressed from having nightmares. So from that time until sometime between 4 and 5 AM, I was awake. I spend those hours watching a movie and playing puzzle games on my phone.

When the clock neared 5 AM, I felt my mind and body wanting to shut down. So I fixed my position to bed, hugged my pillow and immediately had my mind to rest seconds after that.

Now, here’s when things began to get weirdly scary, and obscene (Please don’t read further if you know to yourself that you can’t keep an open mind on what’s about to come).

———

I found myself lying in bed, short’s gone, and covered in sea main (intended mispelling). Now, during this time, I was really really confused about what had just happened. It was crazy, especially considering the fact that I can’t distinguish if I was in a dream or not. The room looked exactly the same as it is in the “waking” life. I can even see my brothers and mother sleeping in the same bed I was in.

Like any sane person would do, I was scared to death to have them see me like that. Sorry to get much to details, but I could feel my heart pounding rapidly as I was looking on my lower body. I have to clean whatever mess I “unconsciously” made before anyone sees it.

So there I was, lying in bed, confused about how I got to the mess I am in, my heart pounding, and my body sweating. I decided to get up, get dressed, and get rid of the fluids. But as soon as I tried to get up, I was pulled right back in. Something out-of-body experience happened. I saw a “lighter version of my body” (I suppose it could be the soul???) trying to move away from my real human body. It’s as if my real body was stuck to the ground and I am trying to get it up with my “soul” but it can’t seem to unite with each other. Whenever I try to push away, I just get pulled back in. It was so terrifying. And what was weird is that it actually felt real. I have tried countless times to have my “body” and “soul” united, but it just won’t happen. I could still remember vividly how terrified I was during that moment. I was scared to death. The fear I had for them seeing me soaked in what seemed to be an act of indecency became the fear of possibly not being able to get back to my body.

And I don’t know if I buy into this “Consciousness existing outside the body” theory, but after that experience, it has really gotten me thinking a lot.

I don’t know if I am posting this to get insights about what I need to fix about my sleeping routine, or if I want to get people’s philosophical and spiritual takes on this experience of mine. Maybe both. But one thing is certain for me, and that is: I AM TRAUMATIZED.

It happens multiple times in a row trying to fall back asleep in the middle of the night. Is this cortisol related? I already know my high stress level is why I am waking up at 2-3am. 

I used to have a somewhat similar problem due to a medication I was taking. Cymbalta caused me sleep paralysis, so I accidentally developed a habit of moving my arms right before I feel asleep to make sure I could (which of course restarted the falling asleep process). I stopped taking that drug 6-8 months ago and have worked hard to retrain my body to not do that (literally focusing on not moving), so it's very frustrating to have a brain jerk where I go from almost asleep to wide freaking awake

1q1gxrh,Is 7 hours normal (7p - 2ish am)?,"A few years ago I was under a lot of stress.  Would go to sleep between 9p and 1130, but wake up at like 2 most nights.  This went on for almost a year until I was laid off from that job (unrelated to sleep stuff).

After that, for a good 2 years or so i often woke up about 3am.  After a little bit of that, I figured it was just life and started going to sleep about 7p.  It didn't bother me socially as I lived in rural America so not much going on when I have night blindness and surrounded by corn.

Now it's a little more fluctuating.  Sometimes I wake up in an unexplainable anxiety at 2/230, other times I can sleep until 3 or 4 (when my alarm goes off to remind myself to bible study).

But I'm not sure, as long as I get 7 hours and I feel untired when I wake up, if it's healthy.  When I ask most people I get criticized for waking up so early, and no focus on the context around it.

I do sleep apnea and use a cpap.  I used to take sleeping pills in the beginning but stopped as it was becoming a dependency and I was needing to take more to get sleep.

I’ve struggled with a racing mind at night for as long as I can remember. I found that typical ""nature sounds"" or ""meditation music"" didn't really work for me—they were too light.

I realized that what actually calms me down is **steady, heavy rhythm.** So, I spent a lot of time creating a ""sleep story"" that follows the 20,000-mile journey of a single shipping container. It covers everything from the quiet hum of the midnight shipyard to the deep, vibrating sway of the Pacific Ocean.

It’s 45 minutes of very consistent, low-frequency sound. If you need a ""mental anchor"" to stop your thoughts from wandering tonight, I hope this helps you as much as it helped me.

1q1dluz,My sleep journey,"I wanted to write this post, hoping that it might help someone with their sleep. I'm not a sleep expert, and I'm not even completely finished with my own sleep journey, but I've made huge improvements in my sleep and I believe that something in here may be of some value.

Lifestyle: One of the things that I did was start exercising more regularly. I use the Athlytic app for guidance on when to train and how hard. Previously, I would just exercise randomly, then be sore for a few days so I wouldn't train. I would say that I pay attention to what the app says, but I don't obsess over it. Same for the Autosleep app. I used to obsess over what it said and get upset if I got a poor sleep rating. Now I do check it, but I don't obsess anymore. 

I also stretch and meditate. I sit at a computer all day for work and I had no idea how much damage that does to a body. I stretch for 30-40 minutes a day, 5-6 times a week. I meditate almost every morning.

Diet and supplements: I take Magnesium Glycinate and L-Theanine about 30-45 minutes before bed. Source these carefully, as they are not all created equal. I've found the impact to be subtle, but significant over time. It's easy to disrupt the effect of the supplements. For example, a lot of people like to drink Monster Energy drinks all day and then wonder why sleep supplements don't help them. I was the same way. I have to be caffeine free after about 9:00 am for the supplements to help. Regarding my diet, I stumbled across ""The AutoImmune Recovery Plan"" by Susan Blum. I think a better name for it would have been ""The Inflammation Free Diet"" or something like that because it has application far beyond fighting autoimmune disease. Poor diet, sugar, eating foods that have pesticides, preservatives, fillers, etc cause inflammation. In response to inflammation your body creates cortisol, which can keep you up at night. My diet is very simple, with as little processing to my food as I can find. We eat homecooked meals probably 90-95% of the time. My typical plate looks like 1/4 starch, 1/4 protein, and 1/2 veggies. I eat as many colors as I can throughout the day, purple cabbage, red peppers, etc. Each color is a different nutrient. I use Cronometer to track my food intake so that I make sure I get all of the proper nutrients. Or, at least, I used to. I feel like I'm doing pretty good in this area and now I just intuitively know what I need and add it to my meal.

Nighttime routine: After dinner, my family winds down. We lower the lights and turn off all overhead lights, and use only floor lamps. I limit TV and phone use during the hour before bed and read books or play board games instead.

I hope that something here helps someone. As I mentioned, there is still room for improvement, but not being able to sleep is so frustrating that I'm hoping someone can benefit from what I've done so far.",1767297946.0,2,2,sleep,sleep

1q131c2,My 66 year old father sleeps only 3-4 hours a night MAXIMUM (this has gone on for years),"First off I would like to wish everyone a Happy new year everyone! As we know, with a new year comes new year’s resolutions. A major resolution of mine is to take note of my health and the health of my parents who are on their 60s. My father is 66 years old, mildly overweight, has high blood pressure, and a few other health problems. My cause for concern is for years now, my father has only been sleeping 3-4 hours a night, 4-5 hours is very rare. I’ve noticed significant changes in his mood, he’s retired and spends most of his day on his iphone glued to the couch. For most of his life he was an avid gym enthusiast working out and boxing multiple times a day, he always was in top shape and his mind was sharp as a tack. During the pandemic, he caught Covid and almost died, he developed major blood clots in his lungs and his health took a major turn for the worse durring late 2020 and onward. By the grace of god he recovered and Im thankful for everyday I get to spend with him on this earth. 

So, to get to my main concern, since his bout with covid his sleep schedule has been a constant issue that worries me greatly. He tends to knock around around 1:30-2 am most night and then wakes up at 5am- 6 am the latest(and rarely, it’s usually 5-5:30 am). Once he’s awake he immediately orders a coffee and some food from dunkin donuts and is back to being glued to the blue lit iPhone screen for the rest of the day. 

I’ve noticed he’s seemed a lot more spaced out durring conversation, if I sit down durring the day to show him a video on the tv, he’ll begin nodding off and snoring within a minute or two. The funny part is, once I get up and turn the video off, he’ll wake back and he’s right back to engaging on X (twitter) or scrolling through instagram reels. He also seems a lot crankier these days, quick to anger if you try to argue a point, very impatient, and has begun having a lot of “senior moments” where he mixes words up or dates up. 

I love my father to death, he’s my best friend and I want him to be around to see his only child get married and have grandchildren. I never had grandfathers growing up, they both died before I was born and I always thought if I had kids they’d be blessed to have my dad in their life.

1q12zxw,Is intentional over heating yourself to sleep normal?,"Hi everyone. I came here to get some thoughts about this very unusual thing my friend does to sleep and if it is something I should be concerned about.

 If there is a better place to post this question, please direct me there.

My friend is generally a warm person. He usually feels almost hot to the touch and hates feeling cold. Usually in short sleeves and athletic shorts in winter, maybe a hoodie, kinda guy.

Well, I have spoken with a lot of people who have known him longer than me as well as talking specifically to him about his sleep habits and observing it in person. He does the oddest thing and apparently has since he was a kid. He tucks himself into a sort of thick cocoon of blankets and has to get super hot to be able to fall asleep. 

I have only ever heard of/experienced people needing it either a little warm or a little chilly to fall asleep comfortably. So this is bazaar to me as he almost has to feel feverish to the touch to fall asleep. 

General health notes:

He has been overweight before and has a large frame that is easy to gain muscle. But before and after getting to a healthy weight he has still needed to do this to fall asleep. It was just even worse somehow when he was overweight and he mentions he kinda misses that extra fat because he feels cold more often, especially his feet(which are still pretty warm to the touch). And can have trouble falling asleep especially when he feels like his feet are not warm enough, sometimes wearing up to 3 pairs of socks. 

All yearly physicals show him in good health with no issues in his labs. The only odd note is he has a very slow heart rate. Otherwise diet is fairly meat and carb based, large portions, not particularly health conscious with some higher than normal physical activity, but that varies as he is an office worker who dabbles heavily in sort of handyman projects inconstantly.

Is this as unusual as it sounds? We have generally left it at, well, everything says he is healthy otherwise, but I am very curious.

So lets begin with im 16 right now, yes you heard that right, 16 with extreme insomnia due to severe case of restless leg syndrome.
Yeah i know, its a bit wild to have a thing like that at such a age but it is what it is!
So im having trouble with sleeping since childhood (still in ironically :) ) having hard time sleeping, staying in sleep, and to get dreams or a deep rest.
It really affected my development aswell, really left behind compared to others at that time.
It got to a pont when a couple years ago i was suddenly awake for 3 days, first, the doctor told me to take magnesium, melatonin etc.
Did it and stayed awake, by the end of the 3rd day my doctor said its enough so i got dormicum to sleep finally.
It knocked me out for 20 hours, never had that good sleep in my life!
After this, it was time to seek a professional, i really dont want to go in details long story short, had a big fight for years, given a lot of sleep drug etc. and then, I got my diagnosis 'severe restless leg syndrome'
Got pregabalin (75mg) for that, at first it was quite good, but still had hard time to actually dream or get a deep rest.
This went until i got a tolerance, okay, doctor said lets add it up to 150mg.
The same case with this dose too but from this after a couple months i was completely numb emotionally
Even tho i had a good environment, girlfriend, everything was going on not bad!
So then the doctor said lets get you back to 75mg to avoid this but to avoid the withdrawal too im gonna give you imovane (zopiclone) aswell to sleep
The dose was 3.5 mg's, at least on paper...
Because at first i got better sleep with this combo than with pregab. Alone.
But after all these years of not getting rest, having problems from my problems (trouble learning, focusing, numb emotional state, restlessness, irritating and sometimes aggressive behaviour from these) is all coming up to me and then i started to ""get everything in my hand""
Instead of the 3.5mg  imovane i started to take 7.5mg then 11mg than 15mg (that was the most)
But the crazy part is, even with 15mg i had trouble with sleep sometimes
But for the most part, this with the combo of pregab. Knocked me out for some hours, but still didnt get deep sleep, dreams etc.
Eventually, my parents found out of this and started to dosing me by their own with the first said 3.5 mg but they gave me 7.5mg at first to not come back too fast.
I didnt get any good sleep since years as i said, but for the past weeks, everything got way worse!
Until yesterday, when i had something going on with my mind...
I wasnt clear minded, confused and started to get angry and aggressive at the evening it got away eventually, but i wasnt clear minded still...
So i go with my evening sleep routine as usual 
(Because i have one perfectly timed and aimed for sleep, but it didnt help at all too, but still doing it for the circadian rythm and everything yk) 
Go to bed at the same time, but i was wild awake for 3 hours and then this complete aggressive behaviour came back i was even confused than before and i just wasnt myself at all.
Started to take alot of med to knock me off ended up taking 525mg lyrica, 7.5mg imovane, 0,25mg alprazolam (xanax) and i knew this combo could slow down my breathing  chatgpt even said i could die from this.
But at this state of mind and restlessness ?
I didn't give a single fuck.
I just laying there waiting for the meds to kick in and after they did, ofc i couldnt speak normally, having trouble coordination etc.
But i was still awake for like 2 hours 
(No, before you ask i didnt use any blue light 1 hour before bed and at this point still didnt)
Then i  was like, you don't want to sleep after all this meds, then FUCK YOU!!
so i started to use my phone with blue light blocking glasses and then eventually i got knocked out for like 7 hours...
It was the end for me, after all this, all this meds, im getting 7 hours of sleep with a short deep sleep no dream still? 
So im really hopeless, confused to what to do
Also to mention: im given  12.5/50mg parlekarv (dopamine precursor) and iron in tablets.
My doctor said this is so severe that opioids would be the thing that would knock this down to zero, but im too young to give me and the risks ofc.
My doctor is taking me to an ""experiment"" bc there is a new one, that people getting ultra- dose of IV iron (that reaxhes the Brain unlikely with tablets) is should help me really well he said.
What do you guys think? Ask me anything i answer but I need to know if there is hope at this point!
Thank you for everyone if they gonna read it, or even respond!!!!

1q0zmd6,Nausea after almost falling asleep and then failing?,"Sometimes when I'm exhausted, I started drifting off to sleep while behind the pc or something. This tends to go one of two ways. One is that I just fall asleep for however long until I wake up.

The other is where the dozing off gets kinda close to completion, I guess, only for me to then jerk awake. I don't think any seconds or minutes of sleeping has actually managed to happen, but unsure. Clock is usually very close to last time I checked, not much time missing.

The thing is, whenever I get this 'sleep-failure', I jerk awake with sudden extreme nausea. Almost to the point of feeling like throwing up, but the nausea subsides pretty quickly. Usually my solution is to just go to sleep, since the nausea won't affect me anymore then.

I've always been pretty prone to dizzyness, and I wonder if this could be some kind of REM sleep thing. Where I enter it, but by jerking awake I get the effects of rapid eye movement while awake, thus upsetting my balance or whatever.

1q0wg0y,Something weird going on with my sleep?,"I always experience random frequent wakeups, whether it's difficult or not to get back to sleep depends on I have no clue like it's random. I've just accepted it as normal at this point.  
But something extra weird has been happening with it for the past couple days.

Sleep is mostly fine in the early hours but once it gets past like about 4 hours or around that, I begin to wake up like every 2 minutes.  
As soon as I roll over to a different position, I get back to sleep from fairly quickly to instantly.  
But the every-2-minutes wakeup itself also isn't much out of the ordinary for me.  
It's the dreams this time.

When this starts up, it repeats the same dream over and over every time.  
And I have no idea what the dream is even about despite 1. the repeating, 2. I'm usually very good at dream recollection.  
So not really able to attempt to make any sense from the dreams if that would even be much help in the first place.  
That's probably in the pseudoscience area anyway at least to some degree.

I don't know. I'm tired and confuses. Especially the past few days.

The only thing I can figure out that's been different is that my lamp broke recently  
and I have had to use the big light as my only source of light at night but both me and the closet monster despise that awful big light with a passion because it is eye-stingingly bright so I usually just have my lamp on or nothing at all.  
Closet monster might be mad at me :( We get along otherwise so it might be fine once I get a new lamp  
but I have no other choice right now if I want to see anything.

And because of the big light being so awful, I haven't been able to be nocturnal as comfortably. I have even More trouble usually if I sleep at night instead of the day.  
But the need for the big light makes night awakeness too uncomfortable.  
So I been trying to sleep at night instead.  
But the change in ""schedule"" probably wouldn't be the cause either because I can't sleep at all if I sleep at the same time every day. There's never been a schedule because there can't be one. So I'm not nocturnal every time anyways, though I usually feel more rested with day-time sleep.  
Although being forced against my will to sleep in the night instead because of mine and the closet monster's detest for the big light mayyyyyy make it a factor because forcing something usually ends badly but I don't know. Just throwing the idea out",1767244497.0,1,2,sleep,sleep

1q0voj9,Proctalgia fugax - I found the solution!,"Answer first then explanation:

90mcg albuterol inhaler, two inhales/dosages, one minute apart. Pain gets bearable at worst within three minutes, then keeps improving. Repeat later after like 10 minutes to make sure it doesn’t come back. Been doing this for like a year and it works every single time. 

Explanation:

I’ve posted about this before, seen others post here about it, and Googled it a thousand times. 

It is a randomly occurring stabbing pain in your butthole that lasts from five to 45 minutes, that will happen at random but *most often while asleep*. Also randomly after activities involving the rectum or pelvic floor. 

It is insufferable and renders you almost completely unable to do anything. The pain is debilitating and absolutely a 7-9 out of 10 every single time for me, including sweating or almost passing out. 

Anyway, I used my doctor and Google and Reddit for years and found recs for pelvic floor exercises, yoga poses, muscle relaxers, diet changes, “not being stressed,” and they worked to a degree but didn’t really give me the immediacy (and convenience depending on the situation) that I needed. 

Randomly found the albuterol suggestion, still don’t know where, and I could kiss whoever found that solution. If you have this problem, please absolutely try this. I am no longer afraid of the random stabs, solving 15 years of dread. The ass attack I had today that was immediately solved reminded me to make this post. ",1767241759.0,2,2,sleep,sleep

1q0tkn1,Why is sleep paralysis not a symptom ?,"I saw a post about this earlier, and I must admit, I agree with the question of why sleep paralysis is not considered a symptom. It feels like the intensity of sleep paralysis, where you’re completely unable to move or scream, has diminished for me. It’s not as severe as the other types of sleep paralysis I experience, and I don’t even bother to scream anymore when I get those.

The most terrifying experience I’ve ever had is when I can’t wake up. I feel like my brain tricks me into thinking that I’ve woken up, but I’m just waking up repeatedly, and it never ends. It feels like I’m dead, and there’s no end in sight. Imagine if this is what happens when you die you get to live for a while, but then you go back to square one, your unconscious body.

There are other strange experiences I have, such as feeling someone biting my head, someone sleeping on top of me, and sometimes hearing an extremely loud scream. I think those are because of all the noise music I listen to at maximum volume lol. But I’m not sure if this makes me schizophrenic in a way.

I also have sleep paralysis related to spiders. Even though I’m not genuinely scared of spiders, I can hear them loudly crawling on my bed or see them walking rapidly around, and that freaks me out.

Sometimes, I also experience sleep paralysis where someone is watching me. I rarely get those, but they’re chill I guess. Why is this considered normal? When will it ever end? ",1767234485.0,2,2,sleep,sleep

(which after I woke up I realised it's a random character I saw from a game called ""No Players Online"" some creepypasta shit basically.) I was fully aware I was dreaming. I could move my body, but my head felt completely locked in place to the point i was trying to free my head and i genuinely felt my neck twisting around from how hard i was trying. Then I heard insanely loud screaming in my ears, like one of those old screamer websites.

I woke up, but the screaming continued for a bit after, which scared the shit out of me. my legs couldn't move whatsoever I was crying uncontrollably not out of fear because I wasn't that scared maybe shock? 

Ever since then, I get loud sudden sounds when I’m falling asleep or right as I wake up. Sometimes it’s screaming, sometimes it’s familiar sounds (like today literally writing this after it happened it was a Windows notification or something I heard earlier in the day also with my friend since he was streaming). It feels completely real, like it’s coming from outside my head, and it instantly jolts me awake. This happens about once a week now and it's genuinely starting to tear me apart I barely get any sleep because of it. 

Maybe is it stress related? since I have a shitty routine with my family and a lot of family fights and problems to the point I literally started having grey hairs at 19.

1q0ns0g,Best CBD non THC sleep aid? Or other advice?,"I (33F) am a notorious insomniac :/ It stems mostly from childhood trauma that made it unsafe for me to sleep, and has developed into night-time anxiety, constant thinking, and sleep procrastination. 

I've been in therapy for years to address the childhood trauma and that has helped of course!

However, it's like I CANNOT turn off my brain at night! Not even anxiety all the time, just constant thinking. I have even been meditating for years, and it doesn't help with my sleep.   
  
I can have better sleep hygiene in general. (no screens within an hour of sleep, meditate right before bed every night). Even if I do improve my sleep hygiene, I think I will  still find my brain running so much! 

  
I currently take 10 mg melatonin and 500 mg of Gabapentin **almost nightly,** and have developed a high tolerance for both of them. Even with melatonin and gabapentin, I am only getting about 1-2 hours of REM and deep sleep, and like 5-6 hours of light sleep. I have tried GABA but that has caused shortness of breath, which increased my anxiety.

I have never tried CBD for sleep. I don't use THC anymore as it typically increases my anxiety and my thoughts. 

  
So---do you all have any advice on CBD sleep aids that either don't include any THC, or have such minimal doses that it would be negligent? Or, is there a combination of **natural, non habit forming** sleep aids that have worked for you? I'd like to decrease my use of gabapentin at least!

I'm open to different ideas and thoughts here, and have dispensaries available IRL. Any form, gummies, tincture, etc, is welcome.

Most people don’t know this, but your body can’t stay asleep if your pineal gland doesn’t have the raw materials to make melatonin.

Try this combo (sounds weird but actually works):

1–2 tablespoons of raw sheep or goat kefir
→ insane tryptophan + bioavailable calcium → melatonin production goes up

A tiny pinch of sea salt before bed
→ stabilizes aldosterone so you stop waking up dehydrated at 2–4am

• 1 Brazil nut
→ selenium boosts thyroid → deeper slow-wave sleep

1pzz08d,Finally found the root cause of my restless nights: Overheating. Here is how a natural solution changed everything,"For years, I struggled with waking up exhausted. I tried supplements, white noise, and cooling pillows, but nothing seemed to keep me in that ""deep sleep"" zone. It turns out, I was a ""hot sleeper"" without even realizing it.

I wanted to share a discovery that changed my life. My mother-in-law practices a generational tradition of hand-pulling silk—managing the entire process from silkworm to the final quilt. I started using one of her handmade silk duvets, and the difference in sleep quality was immediate.

**Here is why I think it works from a sleep-quality perspective:**

* **Temperature Regulation:** Unlike synthetic fillings that trap heat, silk is naturally breathable. It kept me cool in the summer and warm in the winter without that ""sweaty"" feeling.
* **The ""Weightless"" Hug:** It has a unique drape that feels secure like a weighted blanket but without the heavy pressure that causes tossing and turning.
* **Kid-Approved:** My 7-year-old, who used to kick off his blankets every single night (and wake up cold), now sleeps soundly until morning.

I used to view silk as just a ""luxury item,"" but as a beneficiary of this natural wonder, I now see it as a functional tool for health. If you’re struggling with sleep maintenance insomnia or overheating, I highly recommend looking into natural, hand-pulled silk. It truly is a gift of a good night’s sleep.

It first started a few years ago when I was trying to install a bird deterrent that plays high pitched frequencies. I was trying to select a frequency and went thru all of them, it about scrambled my brain, but I set it up and moved on.
That night I was awoken from sleep by what sounded like a drone buzzing above my head and flashing lights. In the moment I legit thought I was about to be abducted by aliens.. and I’m the last person in a million years that would come to that conclusion. It happened several other times the same way until one day I was able to get my husbands attention and tell him “I’m hearing the aliens again”, and he was wide awake and told me there was nothing to be scared of and everything was fine.
So they stopped completely. Thankfully.
But then last night, maybe two years later or so? IT HAPPENED AGAIN. But this time I was awaken by what sounded like noises by my window and then a ray gun above my head mixed with water flowing and my head was vibrating (or it sure felt like it). It was terrifying.

1pzvxmn,I'm not anxious during the day. Only at night. Why?,"during the day? totally fine.

work, talk to people, make decisions, deal with whatever. no panic. heart rate normal. all good.

then night hits.

lights off. quiet. same brain but like... completely different. thoughts just speed up. random conversations from 3 years ago. problems that aren't even real yet feel urgent. body gets tense for no reason. nothing's even happening.

thought for a while maybe I was just ""secretly anxious"" and hiding it during the day or whatever. but that didn't really track? stressful days didn't mean bad nights. calm days could still end with me wired at 2am. made no sense.

what I actually started noticing— and this took forever to figure out— is that night removes everything. no noise. no movement. no tasks to focus on. brain finally has space and if it's learned that nighttime = problem solving mode? it just. turns on. automatically.

also bed has stakes. tomorrow depends on tonight right? that pressure doesn't exist at 2pm. you're not lying there at your desk monitoring your thoughts or checking your heartbeat.

here's the annoying part tho. trying to calm down made it worse. the second I'd check ""wait am I anxious?"" my body would be like ""yes. yes you are.""

helped more when I stopped treating it like some mystery emotion thing and saw it as... idk. conditioned response? not something wrong with me. just something learned. brain doing what it thinks it's supposed to do.

does anyone else feel completely normal all day then the second lights go out you're just *wired*? what do you think actually triggers it?

1pzqt4a,How I finally broke my 5 hours sleep by managing high cortisol,"For the last 3 years, I’ve had a hard limit of 5 hours of sleep. I’m active (gym and sports), so at first, I thought it was just physical stress or diet. But even on holidays, I’d snap awake.

Meditation was the breakthrough - it taught me that I wasn't just ""waking up""; I was waking up with racing thoughts immediately. However, I was not consistent with meditation and ultimately decided to rely on supplements. 

* **Magnesium Glycinate:** My first win. Helped me wake up peacefully and hit 7 hours for about two weeks, but stress eventually overpowered it. 
* **Ashwagandha:** Worked briefly, then stopped (most likely because it doesn't blunt the cortisol directly)
* **Phosphatidylserine (PS):** I read that it helps athletes with high cortisol and usually works within just a few days. While it lowers cortisol, for some people (like me), it increases Acetylcholine. This made my brain too sharp and active at night, making the insomnia worse.
* **Relora:** This was the game changer. It blunted the cortisol without activating my brain.

I realized I was sometimes waking up in a sweat because of late-night carbs or hot showers after sports or at the gym. I fixed it simply by changing my shower & diet timings, and also not covering my legs and head under the blanket. For supplements, I heard that glycine would help to cool down your body, but I never tried it (Glycine in magnesium glycinate is not enough)  
  
I used to take L-Theanine if I was too stressed before sleep, but it didn't go well with Relora. Relora also has a sedating effect so that I can sleep quickly.

My current stack: Magnesium Glycinate and Relora. 

I hope this helps my fellow insomniacs, but please make sure you research any supplements before you take them. Our bodies are different - whatever worked for me (Relora) might not work for you, or could react differently with your chemistry. Test things slowly.

A fellow insomniac gave me a great tip - if a supplement stops working, don't just increase the dose. Take a week off to reset your receptors. You can try this if you want to stick to your supplements, but lose their effect over time.",1767121781.0,95,20,sleep,sleep

1pzm23e,Sleep issues or does my body just have different requirements?,"I'm wondering if my sleep habits are something to be worried about, or if it's just down to 'every person is different'. 

 I practice healthy sleep habits to the best of my ability. I limit screen usage an hour before I sleep, my room is always a cool 68 degrees with my fan helping with circulation, I drink water before bed and when I wake up, and I have blackout curtains to keep my room dark while I sleep.  I have even programmed myself to fall asleep within seconds by switching from laying on my left side to laying on my right side, putting me to sleep very quickly.   
 Despite all this, I'm not happy with my sleep. The big thing is I CANNOT get less than 10 hours of sleep. I can set all the loud and obnoxious alarms I want, but I'll either turn them off while still half asleep and go back to sleep, or just sleep straight through them. I am a very heavy sleeper, so the point where an ex of mine has even told be that kicking me while I'm sleeping doesn't wake me. There's been times where I sort of wake up to turn off alarms and am conscious enough to know I need to get up, but I fall back asleep within seconds. I have lost a couple of jobs from sleeping through alarms because this-or-that happening and not allowing enough time for me to achieve 10 hours of sleep, thus causing me to oversleep. The best way I have found for me to wake at a certain time is to insure that I have enough time to sleep for 10 hours, set an alarm for an hour and a half before I need to wake, then another for when I need to wake up. That pattern of alarms has had more success than having multiples alarms over and hour, or single alarms. Sometimes when that 10 hour mark has been hit, I'll just wake up naturally, and it always feels surreal when that happens, like I've slept for a day and a half.  
 On days that I don't need to get up for anything in particular, or have anything that I want to do, I will often sleep for 16 hours straight, my record being 26 hours uninterrupted.  Not getting up to go pee then go back to sleep, just straight sleeping. I can fall asleep anywhere, regardless of noise level, light level, or comfortability. I've even fallen asleep while standing and welding at a spot welder machine.

 Some issues that I have that I believe may contribute to poor sleep, I have restless legs and elbows. They don't affect me every night, and usually I just get up and walk around for about 15 minutes and I'm good to go back to sleep. I also snore quite loudly, which is possibly sleep apnea, but I've never gone to get that checked or confirmed.

 Any insight towards this situation would be appreciated, even if it's just as simple as ""yeah, sometimes it's just like that"". Not posting here to get sympathy or to confirm any preconceptions on possible medical conditions, I just like to get multiple points of views on things and gather information from multiple sources, especially before looking into taking steps in the medical field as I'm not financially well off enough to do that without being sure it's a necessary step.

1pzatmr,Tips for back sleeping?,"So I'm trying to sleep on my back more. The past 3 years I've been struggling with neck pain and tightness. Lots of knots in my neck and shoulders 24/7 because of sleep. Even with stretching, they persist. I've also probably owned about 10 different kinds of pillows, all of which haven't really worked. My medium soft mattress isn't great, gives me knots in my back and upper back tightness that leads to tension headaches. I use a firm mattress topper to sleep on the floor. It's ok but not great. Anyways, Im a side sleeper, and I've been struggling to sleep on my back. My main issues is breathing when doing so. Everytime I fall asleep on my back, I wake up probably 15-30 mins later gasping for air or choking. I pretty much just stop breathing. I have no idea why. I guess it could be sleep apnea but I am 21, tall and skinny with no health issues (besides my neck pain). I found when I change my head elevation it doesn't always work either. Does anyone know why this could be? Is this normal when learning to sleep on your back? Also if anyone has any tips about how to help my neck pain do tell.

1pz9cxt,My horrific sleep schedule,"I’ve always had a really bad relationship with sleep. I’ve never been diagnosed with any kind of sleep problem, but with the new year coming up I want to start looking into being diagnosed with ADHD, because sometimes I can feel exhausted, but the moment I close my eyes to fall asleep, my head will literally spin with thoughts, and random bursts of motivation. Sometimes it’ll take me an hour or two to fall asleep, and other times I feel so restless it actually stresses me out so much. 

Not only that, my unhealthy relationship with sleep also springs from my phobia of being sick. When I was younger, if I was feeling sick, I usually felt too scared to fall asleep, and my anxiety has gotten to a level where if I did try to drift off, my body would jolt itself awake. 

If I have to give myself a time to be asleep by, I can never stick to it, and I always feel guilty about it.

I’m beginning to get concerned about the long term affects this will have on me, so this year I just want to start working on being better motivated to get good sleep, without it feeling like the schedule is restraining me.

1pz134n,Sleeping for 10 to 11 hours at a time after months of sleep deprivation,"Hello, I just wanted to ask some questions about whether this is a good or bad thing. I started having a terrible sleep schedule because of having 8 AM classes, but also staying up late into the night many days. My periods would cause hormonal induced insomnia, which sometimes would keep me up for many hours into the night. This would be a monthly cycle that would throw off my sleep by large amounts every time. Sometimes I would also stay up for parties or obsess with whatever I was working on. 

This would essentially lead to a pattern of either shifting my sleep schedule by 2 to 4 hours at a time while other times I would have only 4 to 5 hours of sleep. Towards the end of this last quarter of university, I tried to sleep eight hours a night no matter whether my sleep schedule shifted or not. It didn’t really seem to work that well. I was still having symptoms of migraines, severe memory loss, failure of short-term memory, mood changes, brain zaps, blood sugar, issues, confusion, and heart palpitations, and blood pressure issues.

Since school ended, I’m just allowed myself to fall asleep when I’m tired and wake up when I wake up. I feel immensely better. My memory has improved significantly and I’ve only had one prodrome migraine that I was able to stop with a short nap in the past 2 1/2 weeks or so. The palpitations have only remained slightly because I have trouble drinking enough water during the day. 

Although I’m feeling better, my only issue is that I’m going to be having 8 AM classes starting in about a week and I’ve been waking up between 2 and 3 PM. I’m really enjoying this recovery arc however I’m worried about whether or not I’ll be able to wake up on time. I don’t wanna start this cycle again. I’m not sure how to choose between fixing my sleep schedule to wake up at 7 AM. Versus letting my body recover how it has. 

I’m also wondering whether the long hours of sleep I’ve been having means I have something like sleep apnea or whether it’s just my body recovering. I hear a lot of other people make comments about sleeping a long time but say that they don’t feel rested when waking up. I feel very rested though.

Any advice or suggestions would be very helpful, thank you.",1767049271.0,1,3,sleep,sleep

1pywyzh,The Science Behind Better Sleep Starts With the Mattress,"A lot of people try to fix poor sleep by adjusting routines or tracking data, but the surface you spend eight hours on often gets overlooked. The mattress plays a big role in spinal alignment, pressure relief, and how often you shift during the night, which all affects how restorative sleep actually feels. I started paying attention to this after realizing my back pain was worse on mornings after restless nights, not stressful days. Switching to something that stayed supportive and did not trap heat made a noticeable difference for me, and Gh⁤ostBed ended up checking those boxes without feeling overly firm or sinky.There is also no universal best option when it comes to materials. Memory foam, hybrids, and other builds all behave differently once heat and weight settle in. For hot sleepers especially, cooling performance over several hours matters more than how the mattress feels at first contact. Curious what others here have found helpful.

\- Sedentary job (office once a week, wfh at desk 4 days a week)

I cannot think of anything else to do and I cannot sleep. I was in tears last night because his snoring was so loud it was crystal clear through noise cancelling headphones, snore masking audio, and pillows. I am at my absolute wits end and exhausted. I am desperate for help and sleep. 

Here’s some background info:
- He has already been tested for sleep apnea, test came back with very mild apnea (<6 events). Treatment recommendation for this is NOT a CPAP but weight loss. He also refuses to trial a CPAP.
- Referral to ENT has been completed for further assessment but it’s a 2+ year wait. 
- His snoring averages 50 decibels.
- Position changes do not help, he will snore regardless of what position he lays in.
- He’s tried nasal strips, they have not had any noticeable effect. 
- He wears a custom mouthguard/retainer because he would otherwise grind his teeth in his sleep. 
- Sleeping in other rooms is not an option.
- I have tried foam ear plugs, combined with the fan/AC unit going, and TV playing. They barely drown out the snoring. 
- I use the soundcore Sleep A30 earbuds  and they work-mostly. They run out of battery usually by 3-4 AM. Will at times barely cover any snoring. 
- I have been prescribed Dayvigo. Have tried both the 5 and 10 mg dosing, has had no effect.
- We went to bed at different times for the longest time as he was usually awake until 1-2 am. This worked great as I’m someone who likes to be in bed and asleep between 9-10pm. I would fall asleep first and then he would later, so I was able to fall asleep before the snoring started. However, his sleep schedule became normal over the last year and now he’s going to bed at 9-10pm as well.

Since November 18th I’ve been suffering from insomnia. During this time I’ve taken medications like Afobam and Ketrel. Right now I’m taking Ketrel and trazodone at night. Usually on these meds I would sleep 5–6 hours with awakenings and then falling back asleep. For about the last week though, I’m sleeping only 1–4 hours and then I’m not even sure if I fall asleep again.

It feels like I have dreams later on, but I’m not sure if they’re actually dreams or just my thoughts. When I wake up I don’t feel sleepy or tired at all. During the day I also don’t feel fatigue or exhaustion.  
I’m terrified that I have fatal insomnia that’s progressing. I know the first phase is quite mild and it’s mainly steadily worsening insomnia – just like I have now.

10 years ago I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and hypochondriacal behaviors, but that doesn’t mean I can’t be developing FFI/sFI.

My psychiatrist told me that I can rule out this disease and he also prescribed me Escipram for anxiety – the same medication he prescribed me 10 years ago for a different problem.. Still, I have doubts and I’m scared that I’m slowly developing the FFI/sFI.

1pyk90d,Hearing noises from fan,"I wanted to know if anyone else has this issue. For about the past couple years I have had problems sleeping because I can hear wind whistling from the fan. I’ve tried pedestal fans, tower fans, box fans, and right now I’m on a Vornado air circulator. I can’t sleep with nothing because then I have tinnitus. My partner likes sleeping with the fan and he just doesn’t hear it or on the rare occasion it’s prominent enough, he’s able to just ignore it. We are both at our wits end. The Vornado has been ok for a few months. I did a deep clean on it this weekend and it’s still starting to make a high pitched whistling noise. 

I’m fairly certain I have ADHD and a lot of noises are annoying to me but this is over the top. My next option is to just start taking timed release melatonin because I don’t know what else to do. The only time that I’m able to fall asleep without it bothering me much is when I’m drop dead exhausted. 

I have also tried earplugs. I’ve tried loops but they bothered me. I’ve tried a Bluetooth sleep mask with speakers in the ears but music or sleep sounds are too stimulating for me I feel like.

1pyjw1b,"Waking up exhausted every day, takes hours to feel awake... snoring a lot. Apnea or something else?","Hi everyone,

I’m trying to understand what’s going on with my sleep/energy and would appreciate some outside perspective.

My situation:

\-I sleep what should be enough hours

\-I wake up feeling physically awake but mentally offline

\-It takes hours to feel normal

\-Coffee in the morning barely helps

\-Even walking or going to the gym early doesn’t really “switch me on”

\-As soon as I eat, I noticeably improve (sometimes quite fast)

\-I snore a lot, according to others



Important details:

\-This is not just after bad nights... it’s frequent

\-I don’t usually eat sweets or sugar

\-Im not depressed, just extremely slow to start the day

\-Energy improves later in the day



I’m wondering:

Could this be sleep apnea?

Or something metabolic (blood sugar, cortisol, etc.)?

Has anyone had a similar pattern where food helps more than caffeine?

1pyjd4u,Something I started paying attention to about my sleep this year,"I used to think sleep problems showed up loudly — insomnia, constant waking, or obvious snoring.

What surprised me this year is how *quiet* sleep issues can be.

For me, it wasn’t exhaustion or anything dramatic. It was small things:  
waking up feeling “fine” but not rested, random daytime fatigue, and eventually a comment from someone close to me that my breathing at night sounded a bit strained. Not loud snoring — just… off.

Instead of jumping straight to extreme fixes, I started reading about how breathing and jaw position affect sleep. That led me down a rabbit hole of low-intervention options — posture, nasal breathing, and mechanical alignment.

I’m not here to recommend anything or sell a solution. What changed for me was simply *noticing* sleep as a system instead of something that either “works” or “doesn’t.”

Even if I hadn’t bought or tried anything, understanding how sleep breathing works made me more intentional about rest overall.

Curious if anyone else has had a similar slow realization — not a crisis, just a quiet “maybe I should pay attention to this.”

Now it’s different. Exhausted body, wired brain. Same bed, same darkness—completely different result.

I started noticing patterns instead of guessing. Logged over 300 nights: time I went to bed, how long it took, what I tried, how my body reacted. What surprised me wasn’t stress itself—it was how I responded to it.

As a kid, bedtime meant safety. No expectations. No pressure.
As an adult, bedtime feels like a test you keep failing. “I need to sleep.” “If I don’t sleep, tomorrow is ruined.” That pressure flips a switch.

I tried the usual fixes: meditation apps, breathing exercises, supplements, strict routines. Some did nothing. Others made it worse. The more I tried to sleep, the more alert my body became. Heart rate up. Thoughts louder.

The biggest change isn’t age—it’s conditioning. Your brain learned to associate the bed with effort, frustration, and monitoring. Once that loop forms, the childlike “off switch” disappears.

What helped wasn’t forcing calm, but removing the sense of performance around sleep. Less trying. Less checking. Less negotiating with my brain at 2 a.m.

I’m still figuring it out. It’s not perfect. But understanding why it changed helped me stop blaming myself.

1pxr057,Taming Hypnic Jerks: Creative Responses That Helped Me Sleep Again,"Hello, I'm speaking to you from Saudi Arabia, so please excuse my English if it's a bit broken.

Let me tell you about my experience with **hypnic jerks**.

They visited me twice and disappeared just as suddenly twice, and they might come back again—I don't know.

What I'm certain of is that the only way to get rid of the fear is by facing it while changing your response each time.

I'll share with you some helpful responses that you can apply when you experience this condition. It seems medicine has failed to solve this problem with a magic pill, but that's okay—we'll do our best here.

Before you try these responses, there are a few small conditions that will help you succeed quickly in overcoming this issue.

**Conditions:**

First: Go to bed only when you're desperately in need of sleep. This isn't the right time to fight both sleep and hypnic jerks at once. It's enough to have just one opponent.

Second: If you suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, make sure it's calm that night so we don't trigger more fears.

Personally, I massage my neck with a muscle-relaxing cream, do some massage, and sometimes use hot compresses—I don't know if they're helpful or not. The important thing is to focus more on the response.

Now, try one of the following reactions when dealing with hypnic jerks:

**First response: Comforting generalization (You're not alone)**

When you lie down in bed, remember that there are tens, hundreds, or perhaps thousands of people going through the exact same thing right now as they lie in their beds. I'm speaking to you from Saudi Arabia, and I'm telling you there are people suffering here, and I expect there are people suffering in Japan, India, Australia, and Africa. So, because it's so widespread, it's almost as normal as a headache. There's no need to fear it—it's completely normal and not dangerous in any way. Sleep peacefully because many others are in the same boat as you.

**Second response: Remember the origin of hypnic jerks**

The story of hypnic jerks comes from early humans who slept in trees to avoid lions and predators. The brain was on high alert for falling, so it would send those small signals to wake up (your ancient ancestor) so he wouldn't fall and die.

So, this is originally a rescue signal, not a danger signal. If it saved your ancient ancestor, why do you think it will kill you now?

Every time you experience a hypnic jerk twitch, say to yourself: I'm fine—it's just a rescue signal, nothing more.

**Third response: Sarcasm and laughter**

Every time a twitch comes, smile and tell a joke like: ""I wish a lion had eaten my ancestor instead of this suffering."" Or say: ""Oh, watch out, Grandpa—you're going to fall from the tree. Thank God you're okay."" Or: ""Come on, Grandpa, go sleep in the cave,"" and imagine your ancestor in his strange fur clothes waking up startled on the tree.

The important thing is to make the situation more comedic.

**Fourth response: Belittling and contempt (Do this when you're bored of these twitches)**

Every time a twitch comes, say: ""Oh, just nonsense—nothing to fear."" ""Hmm, boring and silly. Anything new?"" Then immediately shift to thinking about something else.

**Fifth response: Motherly/parental care**

Before sleep, grab a paper and pen and draw a cute picture of a character representing the hypnic jerks. Let ChatGPT help you if needed. Draw it, for example, as a fluffy feathered ball with big innocent eyes. Then write a childish story for this character, like: a cute mischievous boy who loves waking his mom to make sure she's okay. He needs love and tenderness to calm down. Give him a cute name like Jojo, Nono, or Cutie.

When you go to sleep, bring this image to mind, and every time a twitch comes, say: ""Calm down, my dear Nono—we're fine. Come, let me hug you..."" ""Mmm, my baby Nono woke up again—no problem, I'm here..."" and so on.

**Sixth response: Love**

Start loving these twitches. Let them express relaxation and deep sleep. In reality, they actually come right before falling asleep, so they're a good sign that you're about to sleep now.

So, every time a twitch comes, say: ""Wow, sleep has arrived!"" ""Wow, I feel so relaxed—finally going to sleep now."" ""Ah, I love this depth..."" and so on.

Try this set of responses for a few days and see what happens.

As I told you, the key is to be desperately in need of sleep so your battle ends quickly. When you get through it quickly for a day or two, it's likely they'll disappear, God willing.",1766927432.0,3,2,sleep,sleep
1pxqyvm,Nocturne Erection And Nocturia,"Hello to everyone who struggles to get a good night's sleep and wakes up several times during the night to pee or because of an annoying erection that won't go away until you pee or get out of bed.

In this post I will talk about my situation, what I found could be a possible solution and regroup all other reddit who talk about this (with different link).

I am 28 years old. I started experiencing nocturia four years ago. One day, I thought my belly was too relaxed, and it looked like an old man's, and I was peeing more than ordinary people. The following night, I started to experience nocturia. I took several tests: a urinary test, a camera inside my bladder, bladder emptying test, ultrasound scan of my bladder and kidney, and a prostate check (with a finger in my ass..). Nothing major was found, just a slight enlargement of the prostate, so the doctor thought it was psychological. I saw 3 French urologist and say the same.

During these past four years, I've experienced this with some back and forth of two-month breaks.

One year before this post I saw another Korean urologist who check my prostate with blood test, prostate check (with a camera inside my ass..). He conclude it was my prostate so he give some medicine but I didn't took it.

Just one month ago, after hip arthroscopy surgery due to a malformation, I started experiencing nighttime erections that last 3-4 hours and won't go away unless I get out of bed. I decided to see another urologist, this time a Chinese one, because I travel a lot for work. He decided to investigate further with an ultrasound of my bladder, kidneys, and testicles, as well as a sperm analysis. We found that my prostate was slightly enlarged at 20 ml and had a small fibrous area. My sperm test also found Ureaplasma urealyticum. I'm currently on antibiotics for this, but I'm still struggling with an erection that won't go away unless I get out of bed and move around or pee (however, pee doesn't always work). I will update in 3 months the situation after my antibiotics and my hips recovery.

After this long introduction my suggestion is do all the test before make any possible conclusion:

\- Urine test, sperm test, bladder test, kidney test and prostate test (not a finger, you need metric to have record of evolution).

\- I hear it can come from also sleep apnea

The things that help me to manage this is:

\- Avoid drinking before bedtime. Don't consume caffeine, theine, or bladder irritants, breathing exercise WHM (this can give lot of stress, this exercice help to manage it).

Other things I know is:

\- In Chinese medicine the bladder is connected with the fear and the perinea is connected with parasympathetic system.

I want to give the link to other reddit post who can help but I can't.

Good luck to everyone struggling with this. You are not alone. We will find a solution together, with all over data and knowledge",1766927319.0,0,0,sleep,sleep

I also worry that it's excessive and that there is some sort of an underlying medical condition because it just doesn't feel normal to still feel exhausted and have to resist the urge to nap after I get smth like 8 hours. 

  
Here's a few things doctors have told me so far:

\- I don't seem to have any allergies that would make it harder to breathe at night

\- my urge to sleep during the day is not so excessive as to qualify for smth like narcolepsy (which I also didn't think was likely, that doctor pretty unhelpfully just left it at 'it's not this sleep issue so thats all I can tell you')

\- went to see an ORL who doesn't think it's a deviated septum but said he thinks the breathing channels (don't know the technical term in English sorry!) might just be slightly narrower than average, and because they swell up slightly at night that could be enough to make me feel like I'm not getting enough air/cause worse sleep quality. But he also said if that is the case there's nothing I can do about it.

\- I had bloodwork done several times over the past few years and there's never anything unusual. 

In terms of other relevant information, I'm not overweight and have not been told by other people who slept in the same room as me that I snore or make gasping sounds in my sleep, but I also sleep alone most of the time so I'm wondering if it could be sleep apnea? 

I try to have a fairly healthy diet with low sugar, I'm a vegetarian (but my iron levels are fine and this issue predates me becoming a vegetarian) and exercise regularly.   


I do my best to practise good sleep hygiene (sometimes I'll still be on my phone before bed but not that often, I tend to read more).

I know that some people recommend waking up at the exact same time even on days off but I'm so exhausted after the workweek and relish the chance to get as much sleep as my body actually wants on those days that I don't think that's a step I'm willing/able to implement currently. 



Sorry for the long long post! I'm just so tired (no pun intended!) of being fobbed off by doctors at this point and was hoping people in this community would have some pointers/could share their experience if what I described is similar to it.

1pxp90v,Blood Sugar and Early Morning Awakenings,"Posting to test a hypothesis and see if anyone else has experienced something similar.

I am a healthy, in-shape young male who trains regularly. Because of that, I sometimes take fat-loss supplements that I probably do not need, specifically berberine and glucomannan.

For a while, I noticed that I would go through periods where I consistently woke up between about 3 and 4:30 am and could not fall back asleep. Sleep quality and readiness scores looked fine, but total sleep time was clearly down. Falling asleep was never the issue. Staying asleep was.

I tried all the usual fixes. Sleep supplements, magnesium, melatonin, better sleep hygiene. Nothing really changed.

Eventually I noticed a pattern. This only seemed to happen during periods when I was actively trying to cut. I started reading more and came across the idea that low nighttime blood sugar can trigger a cortisol response that wakes you up. That lined up with my experience almost perfectly.

I stopped taking the blood sugar blunting supplements and within a day or two my sleep duration went straight back to my normal baseline of about seven hours, with no other changes.

1pxllt6,I ripped the mirror off my door,"A few nights ago, I went to bed with all the lights off in my room. I normally don’t do this because this specific issue happens when I do, but recently I was feeling good about sleep.

I woke up with the same sense of dread I usually feel before this happens and have thought of, “Oh, I’ve passed on” or “Oh, I’m not real anymore.” I panicked and tried to leave this space only to wake up in the doorway with a full-length mirror in my hands. I ripped it off in the process of “ripping out” of what I realize was my pitch black room.

Another instance this had happened was when I dreamed I was trapped in a velvet box for eternity and would have to consciously live in that space forever. I panicked and banged on the walls until I found a small rectangle of light to escape through. When I woke up, I had opened my window. Had woken up later, I’d have probably crawled halfway out of it.

These episodes are very intense and infrequent, I can only recall 4 or 5 instances within the past five years, but this recent instance where I pulled my mirror off and was in the process of leaving my room with it without being conscious as all scares the hell out of me. 

My mother, who I live with, is aware of this because she could hear me banging on the walls and fumbling around in my sleep.

I have told a doctor about this and they suggested it could be the effect of having my circadian rhythm interrupted (my schedule flips around from falling asleep at night or in the morning because of work) or stress. Putting on lights or the TV helps, but it makes it difficult to properly fall asleep, and sometimes I still wake up with that deep sense of dread anyway, though not as disoriented once I register my surroundings. 

I am very tired, and these events fill me with such intense fear that I can feel my heart pounding with immense stomach pain that nearly makes me throw up. I want to cry whenever it happens, but I am too exhausted in the moment and just pass out again. 

I don’t really want advice or directions to fix it. This is a very scary thing that keeps happening because of my unhealthy sleep habits and I just want to know if this is something other chronic insomniacs like me have dealt with. ",1766907623.0,1,1,sleep,sleep

1pxix2j,"Long term sleeping problem made worse with bad sleeping habits, seem to be stuck in a loop","So over the christmas holidays I've had some really really late nights. Getting to sleep as late as 5, 6 or even 7am. I've always been a terrible sleeper. Stark contrast to my mother who never understands and just tells me to relax. For as long as I can remember I have always layed in bed struggling to get my brain to shut up and stop having ear worms, thoughts about things, thinking about the future, anything coming up, daydreaming but while lying in bed. My brain seems to have a festival at night and it feels like torture. It makes me want to start punching things with how insane it drives me.

Thanks to my recently terrible sleeping schedule by which I mean there was none, I'm now stuck in a loop. I can't get to sleep early to reset my body clock so I end up staying up late against my own volition and then because I'm up late I also wake up late and miss half the day. I can't even force myself to wake up. I have two alarms on the highest possible volume and the past few nights I have slept through *both of them* and woken up at 1pm. I think I'm subconsciously turning off the alarm at my bedside because it never repeats.

I'm not an insomniac. I am constantly tired throughout the day. But at night my brain is ON.

This night alone I have thought about:

- The due dates for my upcoming assessments
- Got eds theme from sf6 stuck in my head
- Started thinking about my assessments for university and where to start tomorrow
- Started thinking about a potential combo route for a metered punish counter combo using Jamie's level 3 (but not his CA since you can't combo after it) that would lead to a safe jump
- Began one of the written tasks for my university assessment and finished it
- Started thinking about the chord progression and bassline for the song I'm writing
- Got my bass out to figure out what the bassline was that was playing in my head
- Started thinking about arpeggios in my head
- Needed the toilet
- Got back
- Tried to sleep but got jamies theme from sf6 stuck in my head
- Realised it's almost 5am and I still can't get the fuck to sleep
- Started getting internally agitated that I can't stop thinking
- Opened reddit and started writing this

As I write this it is now past 5am and the earworm has changed into an sf6 character theme I can't remember who for but it has an ""oh oh"" in it that is the only bit that keeps looping in my head like a broken record.

When all this noise is happening in my head every night, how the HELL am I supposed to ""just relax""!?!?!?

1px94my,Tired-but-wired in the evenings (Tips to help),"Some protocols that have worked wonders for me quieting my active mind:

**1. Cognitive off-loading (reduce mental load)**

When you’re wired, the brain is often trying to hold onto unfinished business.

**A. Brain dump -** Reduces cognitive load and rumination by externalising worries.

**How to do it in 5–10 minutes**

* Write everything that’s on your mind, uncensored!
* Do not try to organise or solve
* End with: “This is safely stored; I don’t need to hold it right now.”

**B. The “Tomorrow container”**

If the brain keeps resurfacing tasks:

* Write 3–5 concrete next actions for tomorrow
* Physically close the notebook
* This signals completion to the brain

**2. Attentional redirection (stop mental looping)**

Trying to “clear your mind” often backfires.

**A. Cognitive shuffle -** Uses neutral imagery to block rumination without effort.

**How:**

* Imagine random, emotionally neutral objects in sequence (apple → ladder → postbox → cloud → spoon)
* No story, no logic
* If you drift, gently return
* This occupies working memory just enough to allow sleep onset.

**B. Paradoxical intention -** Reduces performance anxiety around rest).

**How:**

* Tell yourself: “I’m not trying to sleep. I’m just resting.”
* Removes the threat signal keeping you alert

**3. Body-based awareness (interoception)** \- This shifts the brain from threat monitoring to present-moment sensing.

**A. Body scan -** Used in MBSR, insomnia treatment, anxiety regulation.

**How:**

* Move attention slowly from toes → head
* Notice sensations without changing them
* If the mind wanders, gently return

**B. Weighted attention**

If full scans are hard:

* Place one hand on chest, one on belly
* Track physical contact and temperature
* This grounds attention in somatic cues 

**4. Breathing techniques (psychophysiological regulation)**

The goal is longer exhales for parasympathetic activation.

**A. Physiological sigh (fastest downshift)**

* Inhale through nose
* Short top-up inhale
* Long exhale through mouth
* Repeat 3–10 times

**B. Resonant breathing**

* Inhale 4–5 sec
* Exhale 6–8 sec
* Continue 5–10 minutes

If counting is stimulating, use a visual or soft audio guide.

**5. Brief mindfulness (when longer meditation is too much)**

Short, low-effort practices outperform long sessions in wired states.

**Options (2–5 min):**

* Count exhales only (1–10, restart)
* Focus on ambient sounds, not breath
* Observe thoughts like passing weather

1px8pbc,Accidentally found a way to fell asleep easily,"I'm really into mental visualization as it helps me a lot with problem solving and memory, I highly recommend it to everyone. I've vibe coded an app for myself to practice visualization in a structured way, based on this post you can do the same easily with Gemini or ChatGPT, it's super easy. 

It does the following. It has a list of objects or places to visualize (e.g. pine cone, lemon, sandy beach, silk scarf, old leather...). Then randomly it can select n number of them for a session or I can handpick what I want. In a session every word starts with a prepartion time (5s) followed by the actual visualization which I set to 2 mins, when the time is up there's a bing sound (as my eyes are closed). That's it.

Normally when I do it in the morning for 15 mins I'm all okay. But over the last few months every single time when I did it in bed before sleep I've fallen asleep and never ever managed to finish a 15 min session.

According to Gemini ""cognitive shuffle"" causes this. I've already tried a method when I had to say unrelated words that start with the same letter but that was far less powerful than the imagination one.

I guess the trick is 2 min time limits with the bing sound because sometimes my mind starts wandering so I lose focus on visualization and when the time is up I have to switch back and do the next visualization, so my mind can't stuck in wandering and thinking mode but always forced to go back to visualization mode.",1766869837.0,7,2,sleep,sleep

I’m trying to understand whether what I experience could be paradoxical insomnia (sleep state misperception), and I’d really appreciate hearing from others who deal with this.

At night, I genuinely don’t feel sleepy at all, I feel awake and alert. However, during the day (especially around 3 pm), I feel very sleepy, sometimes to the point where my head starts dropping.

When I go to bed at night, it feels like I don’t sleep and that I’m awake the whole time. But when I check the clock, it’s suddenly morning, even though it feels like I didn’t sleep at all.

What really worked for me was the Rainday Antiques sleepcast from Headspace. However, I didn't really enjoy most others - they simply weren't my thing. So I kept cycling Rainday Antiques dozens of times until I got sick of it and then stopped using sleepcasts completely.

  
About a year ago I tried using the voice mode in ChatGPT to generate sleep stories, but that wasn't good enough - the voice wasn't calming and the duraiton was always much too short. So about six months ago I decided to build an app of my own to generate sleepcasts/bedtime stories on the fly, exactly as I want them. I eventually launched the app in the App Store in December and had been using it by myself since to generate 3-15 minute long sleepcasts based on my own personal preferences. If you would like to try it as well, the app name is **Dreamyn** \- feel free to give it a try if you think you'd like personalised sleep stories as well.

  
It does help me personally a lot as I can generate stories about my home town or with specific characters, which is exactly what I missed before. If you think it can help you as well, feel free to give it a go and let me know your thoughts. 



P.S.: This is very much a hobby project that took me six months to build - I am not a developer, so the learning curve was very steep. If you have questions about the experience building the app, I'd be happy to answer those too.

1pwvog0,Antihistamines and sleep quality,"Hi

This may sound like a silly problem, but I have been having issues sleeping 6+ hours and want to sleep longer - mainly due to my fear of increased rick of alzheimers later in life, I am middle aged and want to reduce my risk of heart attack, and my current desire to loose weight.  
So I want an extra the REM cycle each night.

I find as soon as I wake up in the morning, my brain starts thinking about stuff and I cant go back to sleep.

Due to a flag on my health records, my doctor wont prescribe me any better suited sleeping tablets like Zopiclone - but he will prescribe me antihistamines for sleep.  
A life-long problem with my hayfever is that a ""non-drowsy"" teeny tiny antihistamine tablet will put me to sleep for 2 days which means I cant take them when working.  
If i get desperate and take half of a loratadine tablet to stop the itching in my throat or skin, i have about an hour to finish work and get home before i fall asleep.  
Not great when I work outdoors at heights with machinery.

If I take a tablet on a friday afternoon, I am mostly asleep until sunday afternoon. When I wake up for short periods to get food, drink some water or use the bathroom, I am feeling super hung over and fall asleep again as soon as I reach my bed or lounge sofa. I usually dont have a perception of time during these two days.  
So I am not sure if this is proper sleep or some sort of zonked out state.   
Often in this state, dreams seem very vivid and negative. 

But its now the summer holidays and I have a couple of weeks off work. Im gonna relax and give it a go.

So my question....

If i am taking an antihistamine tablet to induce drowsiness and sleep, will that actually cause me to go through the proper rem cycles? Or am I just zonked out and the rem cycles are not happening properly as with natural sleep?

1pwuex7,I need help with insomnia!,"

Hi everyone. I’m really struggling and could use some reassurance or advice.

My insomnia started exactly one week ago. Last Friday I had to wake up very early, got anxious and nervous, and that night I didn’t sleep at all. On Saturday I managed to sleep just a couple of hours from pure exhaustion.

After that, I could only sleep with Xanax, which a doctor prescribed temporarily. With it, I slept 6-7 hours. But the last two nights even Xanax didn’t work. I just close my eyes and lie there wide awake all night. No drifting off, no micro-sleeps. Just stuck in my body until morning.

I’ve tried melatonin, magnesium, herbal teas, sleep hygiene, everything. Nothing helps. It’s now been a full week of this and I feel like a zombie. I’m scared out of my mind and my anxiety is spiraling. I’ve even started worrying about fatal insomnia.

1pwtv96,Now I finally understand why I often wake up in the middle of the night around 2–3 a.m. and then can’t fall back asleep.,"For many years, I frequently woke up between 2–3 a.m. and was unable to return to sleep. I tried many herbal remedies and sedative medications, but none of them really worked. Those medications only helped me fall asleep more easily, but they couldn’t help me maintain sleep until morning.

Later on, I realized that the problem happened during sleep because of my left inferior turbinate. When I lay on my back or lie on my right side, the inferior turbinate in my left nostril would swell and block almost all airflow. But when I lie on my left side, it still maintains some space for oxygen to pass through, so I can sleep through the night.

However, I can’t stay on my left side all night. Sometimes I still end up lying on my back or on my right side, and on those nights I wake up very early, around 2–3 a.m., and then can’t fall back asleep. On such nights, my Mi Band 7 would report my blood oxygen level dropping as low as 88%. On nights when I manage to stay on my left side throughout the night, I don’t wake up in the middle of the night, and the lowest oxygen level recorded is around 93%.

After that, I went to see an ENT specialist. The doctor indicated a partial inferior turbinate reduction surgery on the left side. Now, one month after the surgery, I can sleep through the night in any position. I no longer wake up in the middle of the night, and the lowest blood oxygen level recorded by my Mi Band 7 is now 94%.

If you have similar issues, I recommend monitoring your blood oxygen levels during sleep and paying attention to whether there are any problems with your airway or breathing.",1766828002.0,60,11,sleep,sleep

Thoughts:

- The instructions are terrible. I'm sorry but you have to scan a QR code to access them (already a no in my eyes) and then when it takes you to the website, it barely tells you anything and just tries to shove more products in your face
(Side note - the charger is kinda confusing to look at, but it's just a USB charger, you can just stick it in a phone charger. Make sure the blue light is flashing as that means it's charging, you don't need to buy the dedicated charger off their website)

- I really like the minimalist design. It's very sleek on my wrist, doesn't weigh very much at all, and feels all in all good to wear. The few extra features such as steps and calories is nice as well, but honestly I could take them or leave them (personal preference) 

- The alarm isn't very strong. When I set my alarm, I did sleep through it. However, I am a very heavy sleeper (I am 17) so that may have played a part in it. I'm sure it would have worked much better if I had set 2 alarms or if I was a lighter sleeper

Questions

I'll try attatch a video so you can see what I mean. but it just bugs me that I don't know what it is, and the instructions are helpless

Context:

My wife has been dealing with postpartum insomnia for 4 months. Can never sleep more then 4-5 hours in perfect conditions, no breastfeeding, separate room, blackout curtains, earbuds, eye mask, etc... you know the drill. I would have the baby through the night in a different room, she used to pump but we're now purely formula feeding him as an attempt to give her less interruptions through the night. A lot of the times she is only sleeping 2-3 hours a night. 4-5, is good, and 6 is the best she's ever gotten. Really broken up sleep too.

We've tried a handful of different things, Trazodone, Diet adjustments, CBT, therapy, etc... Nothing has really worked yet. Most of the times with the drugs or even supplements, she gets even more anxious after taking them because she is so mentally sensitive to any symptoms/side effects she has or might get. I try to talk her out of that. It obviously helps to just be consistent with whatever it is you're taking.

It started out as just insomnia, trouble falling asleep, took 3-4 hours, trouble staying asleep, would only be able to sleep in 1-3 hour chunks. 

Now, I have noticed that the anxiety has developed, and has grown quite significantly due to her anticipating the night not going well, and her lack of sleep leading up to this point. She can hardly do day-to-day activities. She's stay at home mom, and still has to have one of our moms come over every single day to help her get through the day. In some ways, I can start to see depression growing as well. Which, who wouldn't get depressed if they couldn't sleep and function on a daily basis right?

She feels like she's going insane, like damage is being done to her brain and body, like it's a cycle she can't break... 

We're trying to avoid anti-depressents. We just know that the problem did not start as depression and we don't want to become dependant on that type of drug, or any drug for that matter.

Anyways, I thought that this 'sleep better' supplement mix might be good ? Because it doesn't just try to help with sleep, but also has Ashwagandha for cortisol/stress, and a more balanced approach to the sleep/anxiety side of things with multiple different supplements. I also thought maybe adding in lemon balm to the mix would be extra helpful for the anxiety ?

Some patterns I would like to look for:

● does my bed time get later each day by a predictable number of minutes or is it random and/or goes both ways (later or earlier)

● what hours of the day am im most likely to be asleep?

● does the amount of sleep hours i have today predict how many hours i will sleep in the following day? What about the following 3 days? Or is how many hours I sleep one day unrelated to how many hours I sleep on the next few days?

● does the time of day I go to bed related to the amount of hours I sleep for? (For example, if I go to bed before midnight, I usually sleep only a few hours and wake up before sunrise, then need another sleep from mid morning to mid afternoon)

1pvys9a,"the 5am routine is overrated, here’s why 6am actually makes more sense for most people","people romanticize waking up at 5 a.m. like it’s some magic identity shift, the moment you suddenly become a “disciplined person.” and yeah, i get that.

waking up at 5 does make you *feel* disciplined for a while. but what about the people who don’t care about being “the 5 a.m. type” and just want time in the morning to move, read, or breathe?

honestly, i think 6 a.m. might be the sweet spot.

i’ve been running a tight-knit accountability community for a while now, helping people wake up early, work out, and do focused work *without* losing sleep.

so i should probably be out here preaching the 5 a.m. gospel, right? but the truth is, most people just need enough sleep and a consistent plan.

here’s what i’ve noticed:

* when people sleep around 10:30–11 p.m. and wake around 6 a.m., they’re still getting 6–7 hours, which is realistic for most adults.
* 5 a.m. sounds cool, but for many it just means chronic tiredness.

if you start work around 9 or 10 a.m., waking at 6 still gives you about three solid hours to do stuff for *you*: workout, meditate, read, cook, journal, whatever matters. that’s more than enough time.

a few small things that help make 6 a.m. work:

1. get morning sunlight. natural light resets your body clock and helps your brain know it’s go-time.
2. do your workout early. energy is highest in the morning and it sets the tone for the rest of the day.
3. watch your caffeine. if you drink coffee after 1–2 p.m., you’ll mess up your sleep.
4. wind down. dim lights after 9:30–10, fewer screens, less doom-scrolling, maybe read or talk to someone. simple stuff but it works.

so yeah, maybe you don’t need to join the 5 a.m. club for Identity shift

“Do you need to wrap any other gifts or are you OK for tomorrow?”

I fully understood what he was asking and knew the answer (I still needed to wrap an easel for my girlfriend), but when I tried to speak, only gibberish came out.

1pvpm41,Had a incredibly scary experience with sleep paralysis last night,"So, last night I had sleep paralysis and it scared the hell out of me. Basically, at some point I was deep diving into some creepy videos and music earlier before bed. It took me a while but I ended up getting to sleep. I started having a very scary nightmare during the night with creepy flashing imagery. There was a voice saying that there was a presence in my room and that if I hear a bang get up immediately. This was all the while some really scary and unsettling music looped in my head repeatedly. The whole time I was aware and conscious in the dream and I kept telling myself ""CURSED, CURSED. THIS IS CURSED. IM CURSED.""

Then came the sleep paralysis. My dream started to slowly blend in with my sleep paralysis. I woke up feeling an incredible weight locking me still. I couldn't move a muscle and I was putting in every ounce of effort to open my eye lids and move my eyes around. Even though I struggled it was the best I could do. Then the music stopped and I heard a loud thud or bang in the dark corner of my room. I managed to eventually moved my eyes towards the noise. The creepy music started playing again, even louder and more intense now.

There was an undeniable presence located in my room. I knew it was there in the dark corner at the end of my bed. There was too much movement in the shadows and I felt like he was just waiting for the opportunity for me to close my eyes again or fall back asleep so he could make his way over to my bed. I had never felt so panicked. The worst part was that my eyes were struggling to open properly and kept closing. Everytime they closed I felt like he was getting closer. I tried to jump up and I tried to move, but my body was completely asleep and paralysised. It was too much and I tried to scream as much as I could. Nothing.

Then I could feel some movement. I felt like I was starting to push myself foward up. I was starting to gape my jaw open in an attempt to scream. I was out of breath from trying but every second I pushed harder I felt like I was gaining slightly more strength to do so. After what felt like forever my faint humming started to become a scream and I pushed myself foward, screaming at the dark corner in an attempt to try and scare of whoever was there. I still couldn't open my eyes fully but a few seconds later they adjusted. I frantically looked around my room and found nothing.

1pvp8j0,Seeing things in the dark as I’m falling asleep?,"Not sure if this is appropriate for this sub, so please redirect me if necessary. I’m hoping someone can give me some insight into what the heck is going on in my brain as I’m falling asleep. Sorry the post is so long. 

I’ve recently noticed that when I sleep in the spare room in my dad’s flat that I will hallucinate things as I’m falling asleep.

It has happened every time I stayed at his within the last month (3 times), and each time the room has been in darkness but the city lights mean that once your eyes adjust you can see quite well around the room. 

The first time happened a couple of weeks ago: I thought I saw my cat standing on some sort of tower structure in the middle of the room and when I sat up to have a proper look to see what she was doing I saw her float upwards and start bobbing along the ceiling as if she was a helium balloon and her string had just been cut. I turned on my phone flash and obviously she was not on the ceiling!

A few days ago it happened again, unfortunately I cannot remember the details but I know it was just as I was falling asleep and it had something to do with the ceiling again.

Last night the lampshade on the main ceiling light turned into some sort of musical carousel with glowing orange lights but it was also on fire. I immediately sat up and turned on my light but obviously there was not a flaming carousel on my ceiling.

This never happens in my own home, although I do sleep talk multiple times a night (I have an app that records it) and I also regularly sit up in my sleep and mess with objects around me (examples include attempting to read books in the dark with my eyes shut, playing with random boxes, and picking up random socks to just hold in my hands all night). I think I am probably on the verge of sleepwalking but I haven’t quite got to that point yet. I have a camera set up to record movement hence why I’m sure of all this. 

I lived at my dad’s full time for 3 years up until earlier this year when I moved into my own home. It never happened when I lived here but it is the same room I’ve always slept in. The room is now completely empty other than the furniture (bed, wardrobe, etc). No decor or personal items. 

Not sure if it’s worth noting but it does remind me of when I was a young teen (around 10 years ago) that whenever I extreme cleaned my room I would always have a weird ‘nightmare’ that a creepy man was in my room. It only ever happened when my room was immaculate, and to me it always felt more real than a dream as it felt like it was happening before I had fallen asleep. This kind of feels similar but no creepy men, just weird things happening on the ceiling.
I feel like it could be the empty room triggering it, but I just don’t understand why that would be the case???

Hope someone has a clue. 

Thanks for reading this far, and happy christmas to all who celebrate!!

1pvou40,Intake Breathing Nasal Strips,"For the past several days, I've been using the Intake Breathing nasal strips off and on, because I find they help me bring in air through my nose easier. I've been using the biggest size strip that comes in the kit, and it definitely helps me breathe. However, I find that it's almost too easy for air coming in, and my lungs empty faster than I'm taking in air, when I'm lying on my back for example.

I noticed that when I wake up from using the sleep kit, the sleep inertia has been extreme, and it's much harder to get up since I've been using these. I'm starting to think maybe I should try a smaller size because there the airflow is too quick or something? It is very helpful for my airflow, but the tired heavy feeling in my face when I wake up is of concern (from using the widest nasal strip).

1pvgfcp,Does magnesium actually help with sleep or is it just placebo?,"I’m honestly still not 100% sure if this is placebo or not, so I’m posting to see what others think.

I’ve had sleep issues for about a year. Mostly trouble falling asleep and waking up after 2–3 hours feeling wired. Sometimes my heart would race for no reason, sometimes my brain just wouldn’t shut up. Nights were the worst.

I kept seeing people talk about magnesium for sleep on here, so I tried it. First thing I used was magnesium glycinate. For me, it didn’t really help. If anything I felt a bit more restless, which was weird. Maybe wrong dose or just not the right form for my body.

After that I switched to finemagtotal magnesium. I chose it mostly because it has multiple types of magnesium instead of just one. I wasn’t expecting much tbh, kinda thought it’d be another supplement that does nothing.

First week, nothing really changed. I almost stopped.

But around day 8 or 9 I noticed I was getting sleepy earlier. My mind didn’t spiral as much when I laid down. That “wired but tired” feeling eased up a bit.

Now I’m sleeping around 6–7 hours most nights. Still wake up sometimes, but I fall back asleep easier. It feels more natural, not like I’m forcing sleep or knocking myself out.

Is it magnesium? Is it placebo? No idea. Could be coincidence. But this is the first thing in a long time that made a noticeable difference without messing me up the next day.

Just curious if others had similar experiences.

Did magnesium actually help your sleep or did it stop working after a while?

Now im not on that stressful part of my life anymore but i do sleep 7 - 8 hours. Now i dont see nightmares, i see them pretty rare. I do worry to get that 7 to 8 hours so i change my alarm pretty frequently. When i wake up i dont feel tired. When i see dreams i imidietly wake up after the dream, then if i fall asleep again that part of the sleep is not like full sleep, i start to see that dream again like it needs to be completed or maybe when i woke up i notice that i was dreaming, thinking about it and then my brain starts to complete it since i was thinking about it. Now based on this am i doing a good sleep or am i overthinking all of this that it is leading to this stage ??

1pv9ftc,I kept waking up sweaty and uncomfortable and didn’t realize my bedding was causing it.,"For a long time, I blamed my sleep problems on everything except my bedding. I thought it was stress, the weather, my room temperature, or just bad sleep habits. I would wake up sweaty, irritated, and not feeling rested, even on nights when I technically slept enough hours.

What surprised me was realizing how much the fabric you sleep on actually matters. A lot of sheets and pillowcases are either synthetic or treated in ways that don’t breathe well. When that happens, heat and moisture get trapped against your skin all night. No amount of fans or AC really fixes that.

Once I started paying attention to breathable, natural fabrics, it made more sense why my old sheets felt uncomfortable. Materials that let air move and absorb moisture seem to make a real difference, especially if you sleep warm or have sensitive or acne-prone skin.

I feel like bedding doesn’t get talked about enough when it comes to sleep quality. We focus so much on mattresses and pillows, but the fabric touching your skin for hours every night is also important. Curious if anyone else here had a similar realization.",1766653666.0,7,8,sleep,sleep

1pv685n,"After a year of bad sleep, I finally started sleeping through the night","For almost a year, I struggled to sleep properly. Falling asleep was hard, staying asleep was even harder. Light sleep, frequent wake-ups, feeling tired no matter how long I stayed in bed — the whole package. I tried the usual advice, but nothing really *stuck*.

A big turning point came when I moved to a tropical climate after living my whole life in the northern part of the country. That change alone forced me to rethink sleep completely.

First, sunlight. In the tropics, you get strong, consistent daylight almost every day. That turned out to matter a lot more than I expected. More daylight helped regulate my circadian rhythm — brighter days = stronger signals to the brain about when it’s time to be awake, which leads to better melatonin release at night. My body finally started understanding when day ends and night begins.

Second, movement. I added active aerobic exercise to my daily routine and committed to a long walk every single day, no excuses. Not extreme workouts — just consistent movement. That helped burn off stress hormones and made my body genuinely tired in a healthy way.

Then there’s the environment. In a hot, humid climate, room temperature and ventilation mean everything. If the room is stuffy or too warm, my sleep instantly falls apart. Proper airflow became non-negotiable.

Another big one: sound. I didn’t realize how much background noise was fragmenting my sleep until I started paying attention. Even small sounds were pulling me out of deep sleep. Soundproofing matters. A lot.

My personal solution ended up being latex bedding — a thick mattress topper plus a natural latex pillow. Surprisingly, it helped with *both* sound and temperature. Latex absorbs and dampens small vibrations and noise much better than I expected, so the room feels quieter and more stable at night. And because of its open-cell structure, air flows through it instead of getting trapped. That means I sleep noticeably cooler, even in tropical heat.

On top of that: a consistent day schedule. Waking up and going to bed at roughly the same time every day (even weekends) tied everything together.

The result? I now sleep through the night. Deep, uninterrupted sleep. I wake up rested, not anxious about bedtime anymore, and I don’t dread nights the way I used to.

Just wanted to share in case someone else is in that long, frustrating “why can’t I sleep?” phase. Sometimes it’s not one magic fix — it’s light, movement, environment, and giving your body the right signals again.",1766640630.0,16,8,sleep,sleep

1pv5e1w,Don't fight it or it will ruin your life - My story since June 2018,"Story Title: My War with Insomnia 2018-2025

  
My war with insomnia started in June 2018 after a very stressful 1st year of Master's studies in France, which itself was followed by a childhood/ teen years filled with family arguments, poverty, and stress accumulated in order to succeed in life.

It came out of the blue, as maintenance insomnia one night: went to sleep between 10 and 12 PM , woke at around 4:30-4:47 AM.  I thought it'd go away, and it eventually did one month later, when I was just traveling around, having fun, and basking in the sun while surrounded by nice, friendly people.

Then the autumn months came, I was in Istanbul for my 2nd year of studies, and the sleep issues came back.

I did not waste a minute: went to medics, took magnesium (which worked for a little bit), saw all types of professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, psychoterapists, psychoanalysts, even talked to a witch. Took all sorts of pills, got bloodwork done, tests over tests, over tests.

I started being prescriped harder and harder medication until I was prescriped clonazepam (kolonopin/rivotril). At the beginning it was heaven, it was wonderful, but in just a couple of months hell would break loose.

I was initially prescriped 2 mg of clonazepam but now, after 1 year of trials, I am down to 0.5 mg and will soon cut it all out.

During these almost 8 years I did achieve quite a few things, but I have lost much more, and that because I fought insomnia with all I had. I no longer had a life. All time and money would go into finding solutions that never worked or got me in a worse state than when I started. 

I lost a great relationship, great opportunities, and even messed my health up more in the process.

HOWEVER, one important piece of advice: If you drink and smoke, quit both of them, they will harm your sleep the most.

  
TLDR: So, in conclusion: don't fight it. Wake up when you do, drink some tea, change your work place , or friends group, or living space/citiy/country if it is too stressful and unhealthy, but don't let it rob you of your life like it did for me.

1pv0zcb,What actually helped me fall asleep faster and sleep more deeply after years of insomnia,"Night used to be the hardest part of my day. I could be exhausted and still lie in bed staring at the ceiling, waiting for my body to do something it refused to do. My mind stayed alert. My muscles stayed tense. Bedtime felt like pressure instead of rest. Insomnia slowly changed how I related to sleep. I started dreading nights. I watched the clock. I worried about the next morning before I had even slept. Even when I did drift off, the sleep felt light and fragile. I woke up tired and foggy, like my body never fully shut down.

What helped wasn’t a single trick. It was changing how I approached sleep as a whole.

I stopped treating sleep like something I had to make happen. I went to bed aiming to rest rather than fall asleep. Once I removed that pressure, sleep started coming sooner. My body relaxed when it stopped feeling tested. Sleep onset improved when I built a calm wind down window. Dimming lights. Putting my phone away earlier. Repeating the same quiet actions most nights. That predictability helped my nervous system slow down.

Temperature mattered more than I expected. A cooler room helped my body settle. A warm shower before bed followed by cooling made it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep longer.

Caffeine timing played a role too. Even small amounts late in the day kept my system alert at night. Hunger also disrupted my sleep, so a light snack before bed helped stabilize things.

Sleep quality improved when I reduced stimulation at night. Bright screens, intense conversations, and scrolling kept my brain active. Lowering stimulation in the hour before bed helped my sleep feel deeper and more continuous.

Noise was another issue. Small sounds pulled me out of deeper sleep even if I didn’t fully wake up. White noise smoothed those disruptions and helped my sleep feel more solid.

Daytime habits mattered as well. Gentle movement during the day helped my body feel ready for rest at night. Not intense workouts late in the evening, just enough activity earlier to build natural tiredness.

What made this sustainable was keeping a few things the same each night while allowing flexibility around them. Familiar routines made bedtime feel safe. Small changes kept it from feeling rigid or stressful. I use Soothfy to support this during the day. The anchor activities help me stay grounded and regain focus when work feels scattered. The novelty activities help refresh my attention when my brain starts drifting. They’re short, simple, and easy to fit into a workday without pressure.

Insomnia didn’t disappear overnight. Progress came gradually. Falling asleep became easier. Sleep felt deeper. Mornings stopped feeling like a battle.

If falling asleep or staying asleep feels impossible for you, you’re not broken. Insomnia is often about regulation, not effort.

For me the main issue wasn’t just not sleeping. It was lying there alone with my thoughts. I kept checking the time, thinking I had to fall asleep, worrying about the next day. That pressure honestly kept me awake more than anything else.

What helped was giving my brain something else to focus on. I started putting on long audio at night and just listening. I wasn’t trying to sleep or relax, just listening. If I stayed awake, fine. If I fell asleep, also fine. Once I stopped forcing sleep, it became a lot easier.

At some point I started making and listening to my own sleep audio because I hate ads or sudden noises waking me up in the middle of the night.

Breathing ex \[and esp mindfulness ex where you focus on each body part in turn and perceive it, excluding other thoughts\] help me fall asleep but not stay asleep.

I bough some fresh asparagus on a whim bc it was on sale. Haven't had it in a few years.

12 asparagus spears (steamed w/ salt) with dinner Sunday night.... I slept 6 hours straight for the first time. I did a double take when I saw the time, thought it was a mistake.

12 asparagus spears again last night with dinner, AGAIN slept 6.25 hours.

web says asparagus contributes a building block of serotonin. So does turkey but eating turkey daily the past two weeks (but as it happens, not the past 2 days) had no affect.

But then BOOM asparagus kept me asleep. What the? My gut must do better getting the ingredient from a veg source?

1puphnk,"Trying to quit ambien/melatonin, struggling to go back to sleep during middle of night","Hey there.  I took ambien and melatonin for 12 years. It started off as a quick fix to get me through some high stress work moments in a time when I wasn't sleeping well, and then I continued taking them because the work stresses never stopped.

I'm in between jobs now and starting a new one next month. I see this as my last chance to quit before the job begins, as once the stresses start I'm going to have to sleep, either with or without chemical assistance. I also have kids that need my energy. 

I stopped taking them on December 3rd. The first three days were very rough, and then the next five were much better. Once they improved, I slept up to 7 hours a few nights without the drugs and it felt way better than 7 ambien-induced hours ever felt! I was thrilled and wanted more of that.

But something happened and the last week I've reverted back to sleeping terribly. The last week I've slept 3-5 hours every night. I can get to sleep fine, but I seem to not be able to get back to sleep once I wake up in the middle of the night. Now my confidence in getting back to sleep feels shot and I feel anxious about the prospect of not being able to get back to sleep, which makes it harder as I'm sure many of you know.

I have tried some breathing exercises (long, slow inhale/hold/shorter exhale and focusing on the breath), body scanning, boring mental exercise like simple arithmetic or other counting sheep-like things.  I listen to a couple podcasts and familiar things that have helped me in the past, and still, no help. I understand the principle of getting up and leaving the bed after a certain amount of time so as not to just be restless in bed and causing a negative association with that space, but I often have difficulty identifying the right time to get up. 

I guess I'm looking for some exercises or techniques that come with a high confidence rating, i.e., that I can know are sure bets and I can approach confidently so as not to get caught up in anxious thinking.  Or is there a sleep psychology/help book that I can buy that is a definitive guide to getting over this kind of issue?

The program relies on absolute consistency, and I am my own weakest link. I need a structured, digital CBT-I program that includes a real, human coach to offer accountability and personalize the schedule beyond a simple app algorithm.

1pumtx5,this is my story i am tired,"hello everyone i am 29F going to be 30 soon 

i have been battling sleep anxiety since October

it started suddenly 

this is going to be long 

so starting of October

it was a normal day i went to sleep-as usual and damn when i closed my eyes and tried to sleep it sets me off

my heart started racing and chest muscle started clenching even harder because of the palpitations i couldn’t sleep at all and i got fearful of this thing so the first night went like this and i couldn’t sleep 

the next day i felt like a zombie with zero sleep at night everyone said its okkk it happens sometimes 

i was like no its not its different 

i used to be the type who could sleep instantly anywhere and anytime and i slept instantly as my head hits the pillow 

i was so frustrated i cried so much because sleep is so precious to me 

the next day i tried to nap and yes it happened again 

little did i know that it will be like this 

so night came and yes i went to bed with positive affirmations 

i also went to hospital in day because i was so so frustrated they gave me sleeping pills and i took not only one but two of them 

i skipped work because i couldn’t process anything at all

so that night i took 2 sleeping pills and ofc i slept 

the next night it happened again i slept for like 4 hours only i wanted to take sleeping pills again but couldn’t muster up the courage 

then i went on like this for the rest of the month

symptoms kept adding up now when i started sleeping and if i by mistake was in sleep my whole would suddenly vibrate and my breathing stopped then yes i was not able to going to sleep again because yes i was no longer one of those people who could sleep again like normal 

my thoughts went dark and i started having panic attacks when i slept i accumulated the fear of sleeping so yess panic attacks would wake me up and i was sweating heart racing 

sometimes i would walk in sleep and would talk to my mom briefly and then went to sleep again

next day my mom would tell me this i was shocked

all of these things kept happening till mid november 

because of peak anxiety and stress idk if thats the cause i had a vertigo attack i was eating normally it happened so suddenly 

then that day i was in vertigo all the time 

i couldn’t even walk straight and by so much effort i laid down 

yes stress does crazy things to your body

now i was in for a new ride you can see the posts on my feed you will know what i went through plss do if you are reading all of this

so fast forward to night of 14 December 

after these new symptoms thank god i was able to sleep well for 8 hours

but heres the thing i went to sleep normally on 13 december i woke up at 3:30 am midnight all sweaty and then i thought its okkk its normal

then i was awake and suddenly electricity gone and i am afraid of the dark yess i am 

and i was so anxious oh my god i cant even tell that was the starting point of these things happening again

now when i closed my eyes, i would see patterns and oh my god i cant even tell that literally killed me 

anxiety at its peak again 

now after overthinking all day about sleep problems and then all this shit happening 

i went to bed on 15 December and yes i didn’t slept even a bit 

symptoms changed their intensity 

i am totally going crazy now 

i am suffering with bouncy vision and when i move my head i get so so dizzy

i want to cry so bad i am screaming inside

i take magnesium glycinate 200 mg and its not helping at all

pls tell me what should i do 

i am literally having suicidal thoughts 

my family understands but not everything i tired if telling things to people now some laugh at my condition and say you are crazy 

doctors also say you are crazy 😭

1pumlvh,Magnesium has changed my life!,"I’ve always been a terrible sleeper. As a kid, I could lie in bed for hours staring at the ceiling, thinking about everything and nothing at the same time. But as I got older, it got worse. Stress from work, bills, life in general… it seemed like my brain had a permanent “ON” switch. Nights became this endless loop of tossing, turning, and mentally replaying the same thoughts over and over. I tried everything — warm milk, meditation, white noise, even those fancy herbal teas — nothing really worked.

Then one day, after yet another week of almost no sleep, I read something about magnesium. Apparently, long-term insomnia can actually drain your body of essential minerals, like magnesium, calcium, and iron, which then makes it even harder to sleep. I was skeptical, but I figured I had nothing to lose. I started with a high dose of magnesium, around 500 mg a day, taking it consistently every evening. I also added some iron and colostrum for good measure — mostly because I liked the idea of nourishing my body while trying to fix my sleep.

The first few nights, nothing seemed to happen. I still stared at the ceiling. But after a week or two, I noticed a difference. My thoughts weren’t racing as much, and I could actually feel my body wanting to relax. Sleep came more naturally. I switched to FineMagTotal, which has seven types of magnesium in one capsule — maybe that helped because things seemed to improve faster. Over a couple of months, my sleep became deeper, I woke up feeling refreshed instead of like I’d been hit by a truck, and even my daytime anxiety eased.

The weirdest part? I never expected this to fix my social anxiety, too. I used to dread crowds and social events, my heart racing whenever I had to meet new people. But after months of steady magnesium, iron, and colostrum, I noticed something: I could actually go out without panicking. Sleep and mental calmness went hand in hand in a way I didn’t expect.

Now, even if life gets stressful, I have a little ritual: a magnesium capsule in the evening, a calm cup of tea, and letting my body guide my mind into sleep. It didn’t happen overnight, and it wasn’t magic, but slowly, night by night, I finally reclaimed my sleep. And honestly, it’s changed my life more than I could have imagined.",1766580411.0,100,34,sleep,sleep

1puiptp,Lifelong sleep issues that i'm fed up with. Doctors won't take it seriously.,"Hey all,

I have had sleep issues for the longest time with little direction from doctors. Hoping someone here can guide me in the right direction. Here's a write-up summarizing my frustrations. I wrote 80% of this with ChatGPT because its 3:20AM and I can't be fucked to channel my Shakespeare right now. If its italicized, its Chat.



Regardless,

*I’m a* ***19-year-old male****. I’ve had sleep issues for as long as I can remember. This isn’t a new phase, stress-related, or something that came on suddenly — it feels lifelong and baked in. The core issue is that my* ***sleep requirement to feel okay is excessive****. I don’t feel functional on 7–8 hours. I don’t feel good on 9. Most of the time I need* ***10–12 hours*** *to wake up feeling even remotely normal, which obviously doesn’t work with school or work.* If In extension to this, I'm at any sort of hotel with friends, I will ALWAYS wake up 2-3 hours after everyone else, even if falling asleep occurs at roughly the same time.

*Waking up itself is also a problem. It’s not a clean “wake and go.” It’s a* ***2–3 hour process of waking up, drifting back to sleep, waking again****, before I finally feel sufficient. If I try to get up the first time I wake, I can feel that I’m not ready, sort of like the drive to go back to sleep after using the bathroom in the dark. Pushing through just feels wrong, and I usually end up back in bed if not constrained by schedule.* The point to take away here is that the entire ""process"" of sleeping, which is what I now refer to it as, can be as long as 11-12, even 13 hours which makes a work/school week basically impossible.

*Falling asleep is another issue. I’m* ***almost always uncomfortably hot while trying to fall asleep****, even in a very cool room (55–60°F). This has been true for years. I’m usually fine by morning, but the falling-asleep phase is consistently uncomfortable.* I usually run my A/C at 62F in the summer, and open the window with a fan blowing during winter. On the RARE nights that I am genuinely tired, this doesn't seem to be an issue.

*My* ***circadian rhythm drifts very easily****. If I don’t fight it constantly, my bedtime slides toward* ***4am or later****. Work has forced months of strict routines — same bedtime, same wake time — and it never feels natural. The moment structure loosens, the schedule collapses again. Because of this, I’m* ***reliant on melatonin many nights*** *just to initiate sleep.*

*During the day, I have an* ***extreme desire to nap after school/work****, even when I’m fasted (so it doesn’t seem blood-sugar related). It feels like a genuine demand for sleep, RIGHT NOW.* I have caught myself dozing off driving home from school/work on a few occasions*. What’s strange is that if I’m forced to stay awake and don’t have access to a bed or couch, I almost always hit a* ***second wind around 7pm*** *and can stay up with high energy until* ***2am or later****.* This happens damn near **every single night**.

Here's some personal notes not written by Chat. 

I've sought medical help from 2 doctors to no avail. I'm not sure if theres some magic fucking dust I need to spill or what, but they never seem bothered in the slightest. ""Have you tried melatonin?"" Yes, Doc, I've been doing that for half a decade. ""Have you tried buying a more soothing alarm clock?"" If it was only that easy, doofus.

As you can tell, I'm about ready to crash out over this. Day to day function in a workplace or school environment suck ass. There's genuinely no way this is normal, right? I'm beyond frustrated over the medical system taking no interest in helping issues that can't be resolved immediately by expensive medication.

In closing, I know this entire post is sort of a mess but take it as a display of my frustration. To anyone that has genuine guidance, I am eternally grateful. I can provide details into any questions you may have.",1766565789.0,3,2,sleep,sleep

Now that finals are over, I’m trying to go back to sleeping long, normal hours, but I can’t.

I fall asleep, sleep for about two hours, then wake up on my own. The problem is that when I wake up, I feel alert and energized, not sleepy at all, and I don’t feel like going back to sleep.

This has been happening for a few days now, and I’m worried it might affect me in the long term. My relationship with sleep has never been great, but this feels different.

Had my first hooked up to the wires sleep study recently. Before that I always did sleep logs, age 40, female. I'm kinda starting over with sleep doctors because all my other doctors have been retiring in recent years so I have new doctors and can get new opinions, although I always liked my doctors before



Diagnosed with primary insomnia for most of my life at this point



Sleep problems lifelong including long time to fall asleep, waking repeatedly/trouble staying asleep, and not feeling restored. Lifelong issues but worse lately and new symptoms so reevaluating what I have done all my life. Still need to follow up after my sleep study but I got the preliminary reports. Had four hypopneas total, mild, there was no concern I have sleep apnea so that is ruled out from study report I got

  
I feel like I manage my life around sleep. When I eat & drink. Never napping - I do not want to nap but have fallen asleep in late afternoons lately despite my efforts which only worsens night sleep. Having very low blood pressures when I fell asleep against my will and that better managed with increased salt intake and higher daytime stims (concerta + Ritalin I do have ADHD)

  
Mostly I managed well with all the sleep hygienes there are. Maybe I have a mountain dew at 4pm, but basically I follow every sleep hygiene like the 10-3-2-1-0 rule, sleep number bed, various pillows for supports, knee pillow, no pets in bed, no screens in bed, temperature controlled bed sheets, sound machine, eye mask, meditating/yoga before before/no screen 30-60 minutes. 8pm trazodone (very helpful shortening time to fall asleep to only 30-40 minutes). Have antihistamine or Flexeril at night as needed. In bed around 9:30pm, out of bed at 6am all days of the week. Manage 6-7 hours of sleep but I wish it was more

  
I'm so tired. All I do is work and some basic chores and it really should be more. When I  accidentally was falling asleep in the afternoon that was wrong to the core. It is better with stims and getting my blood pressure up. I am not managing well. Winter blues likely do not help with depression/anxiety shit

  
My sleep study showed I had 32 min sleep onset latency, 10 awakenings and something like 25 micro arousals all night, 4 hypopneas only my side (none supine), mild snoring noted only on my side (none supine), about 15 minutes of stage 3 sleep at 2.25 hours in, and about 45 minutes of REM sleep at 6 hours into sleep. I only had REM sleep on my side which sounds crazy but I have noticed this all my life. I can only deep sleep on my back and dream on my side. I'm also thinking it is messed up I don't have multiple sleep cycles? Barely managed to get part of every cycle through this night. Sleep efficiency at 74% per report

  
This is getting long so I'll stop. Input appreciated? I never had the full EEG study before so much of this info is new to me. Always did sleep logs before. Never seen a neurologist but I could, I have good insurance",1766527505.0,2,2,sleep,sleep

1pu2wht,The Strange Wonders and Mystery of Sleep,"You ever think about how weird sleep is? I mean, every night we lay on a comfortable surface, close our eyes, and lose consciousness for several hours. Every animal does it, and it's considered completely normal. One third of our lives spent living in an entirely different, subconscious world. A realm filled with dreams and nightmares, forgotten as soon as the morning light pierces our eyelids.

I recall a night when I couldn't sleep. Lied awake, staring at the ceiling, watched the shadows move as cars passed by outside. All the while, my feline friend snoozed at the foot of the bed, completely unaware of my restlessness. It's intriguing how this phenomenon of sleep affects all living creatures, yet, the complete volume of knowledge surrounding why we sleep is oddly small. 

So, isn't it odd that something so fundamental to existence, is still something we don't completely understand? Isn't it strange to think about what all we could accomplish if we never needed to sleep? Or what dreams would be like if we could consciously control them?

1ptsdcv,How am I supposed to actually go to bed?,"Heya,

I've recently been trying to up the amount of sleep I get, and I think I got that down, but now my main issue is going to sleep within 30 minutes, because often times I'm still awake past 30 minutes, sometimes even 45.

I've really tried close to everything I can think of (to a certain extent). I've tried thinking about a random scenario, I tried thinking about my day, I tried listening to music, listening to ASMR (with and without voices), but none of that helps. The best sleep I can get is when I actively try and think about whatever. I am unable to go to sleep thinking about *nothing*.

Am I supposed to be thinking about nothing? I've tried focusing on *only* my breathing, or *only* what I was listening to, but whatever I was listening to would keep me awake if I focused on it, and focusing on my breathing didn't get my 'any closer' to sleep. I'm under the impression I'm supposed to be focussing on my breathing, yet I always stop doing it (after around 10 minutes or so) and think of something because I fear I'm just wasting my time.

I stretch before bed now, wind down, and do 4-7-8 breathing, however I've still seen a net increase in the time it takes to go to bed (on the bright side, I've been less stressed than ever!), so I don't really know what to do anymore? I even tried the 'military method' to no avail. Is it just a matter of training where I have to force myself to be able to sleep thoughtlessly?

Thank you for any advice!

Edit: I tried sleeping last night by \*only\* listening to my breathing and I had the most terrifying experience ever where my brain was very much awake but it felt like I was passing out (or, what passing out would feel like to someone who had never fainted before), is that what it's supposed to feel like?

1ptr6qs,Sleep better at college than at home,"I’m looking for advice or insight from anyone who’s dealt with anxiety-related insomnia or something similar.



I’ve had mild insomnia since around 2019, mostly tied to anxiety. I also have OCD and tend to be very anxious about medications and bodily sensations. I do have hydroxyzine prescribed and I take it only when absolutely necessary, but I try to avoid it because if a medication affects my motor function or makes me feel “off,” I tend to freak out more, which just makes sleep harder.



My insomnia has definitely fluctuated over the years. What’s confusing me now is that I’ve noticed I sleep better when I’m away at college than when I’m home on breaks. This feels strange because I go to school in a major city with constant outside noise, sirens, people, etc. Meanwhile, my home environment is relatively quiet.



When I come home for breaks and struggle to sleep, I’ve tried white noise to replicate the city, but it doesn’t seem to help much. What’s odd is that it really seems specific to being home, my bed comfort is basically the same, and my living situation at home is normal and not stressful in any obvious way.



Has anyone experienced sleeping better in a “worse” environment and worse in a quieter, familiar one? Could this be anxiety, conditioning, or something psychological rather than environmental? I’d really appreciate hearing others’ experiences or any ideas on what might be going on.

1ptqn9h,Poor sleep accelerates muscle loss,"Read this post where the doc was talking about how closely related poor sleep is with Muscle loss. 

Poor sleep isn’t just about feeling tired. It actively shifts hormones and metabolism in ways that make muscle harder to maintain.

Even short periods of poor sleep can:

* Increase cortisol (muscle-breaking signals)
* Reduce insulin sensitivity and hence diabetic risks
* Suppress growth hormone
* Increase inflammation

This would mean weakening muscles which in turn would cause reduced glucose uptake, toxic accumulation and high oxidative state. 

Over time, less sleep → less muscle signaling → weaker cellular regulation.

1ptpvxi,how do i fix my sleep,"So I’ve been struggling with my sleep for a few years. I started going to bed later than I should around age 10, and it’s just gotten worse since then. I’m 17 now, and over the past 2–3 years it’s really started to affect school and my daily life. I miss more and more school because I can’t wake up, and the problems just keep stacking up.

My sleep schedule is all over the place. I usually only get sleepy around 3AM. Most days I fall asleep between 1 and 3AM for a few nights, then I might get one or two nights of “normal” sleep because I’m too tired, but then I have a really bad night where I barely sleep, and then the cycle starts over. Some weeks I average maybe 6 hours, other weeks less.

I’ve tried a lot of things—melatonin, valerian, leaving my phone downstairs, podcasts—but nothing really sticks. Even when something works for a week, I always fall back into my old rhythm. Weed sometimes helps me fall asleep earlier (between 11PM and 2AM), but I don’t feel rested the next day and I don’t want to rely on it.

I’ve also been a bit scared to go back to doctors or professionals. I tried once, and they told me to go to bed later instead of lying awake, which worked for maybe a week, but then I fell back into the same pattern. I just don’t really know what will work long-term.

I’m looking for tips that actually help stick to an earlier sleep schedule without falling back into the same cycle. Not the usual “put your phone away” advice.

One thing that surprisingly helped me was falling asleep to very neutral content. Not podcasts, not stories, not affirmations. Just calm, emotionally flat facts. Physics, space, random science. Stuff interesting enough to hold attention, but boring enough that my brain stopped spiraling.

It worked because I wasn’t trying to sleep. I was just listening. No pressure, no fixing, no “please knock me out already.” Over time, the anxiety around bedtime softened a lot.

I couldn’t really find content that stayed consistently calm and factual without hype or emotional hooks, so I ended up putting together my own long-form fact-style videos and listening to them like a playlist at night. I originally made it purely for myself, but I left it public in case it helps anyone else who needs something neutral to anchor to.

This isn’t medical advice and it definitely won’t work for everyone, but if your insomnia is fueled by racing thoughts and nighttime anxiety, this kind of input might be worth experimenting with.

It's not that I'm fully rested and ready to leap out of bed - often it's quite the opposite - but my brain seems to have conspired with my body clock to beat the alarm at its game. Who knows, it could be some kind of internal rebellion against mechanical tyranny.

Something interesting happened last Tuesday. The night before, setting my alarm for a rather ungodly hour of 6 AM, a dreaded board meeting was supposed to take place first thing. But lo and behold, eyes popped open at 5:58 AM, two whole minutes before the electronic squawking. It was a bit surreal, staring at the clock, barely any light seeping through the blinds, all while my brain is still ensnared in the remnants of a dream.

Now that I’ve mentioned this, I can't help but wonder if I'm the only one experiencing this odd occurrence or if it's a more universal phenomenon.

1pt7atq,Haven’t slept in two months,"Hey guys, I am looking for last resort help with my sleep problems. For about two months now I haven’t been able to fall asleep for longer than a couple of hours. No matter how exhausted I am.

I think that my main issue is putting my mind to sleep. It is difficult to put to words but effectively I am aware that I am “sleeping” at any point in the night, and I can freely move, however time passes by fast. In this state I feel zoned out while my mind continues to think about something (it is not a conscious thought but more like tv running in the background).

I tried getting help from doctors unfortunately they just brushed me off and told me that it’s probably just stress. I also tried: meditation before bed, stretches, herbal tea, no screens, getting high to fall asleep and a bunch of other things I found on the internet.

I am not living a particularly stressful life so I really don’t think that is what is keeping me up at night. Any suggestions are welcome, thank you.",1766428800.0,2,12,sleep,sleep

Also if try to go bed early like 10-10:30 pm. I usually wake up within an hour or two versus going to bed at midnight I’ll wake up 4-5 in the morning. But I haven’t had a full uninterrupted night since then. Not sure if this is sleep apnea cause I never wake up choking and my ex girlfriend last year didn’t notice anything besides light snoring. What could be the cause of this. I’m thinking it was when I used party drugs around that time and it just messed everything up but I’ve been clean since 2023 but the damage seems like it’s always been done. I’m desperate and want a cure to this. Any suggestions? I might need to supplement with 5 htp cause melatonin and magnesium hasn’t done anything.

1pt642b,How long until quitting melatonin fixes nightmares?,"I’ve always had trouble sleeping, and my body’s preferred sleep schedule is around 3:30am-12pm. I’ve always had nightmare trouble. I’ve been using melatonin “supplements” pretty regularly for a few years, usually 1.5mg or 3mg a night. I currently cannot meditate before bed because my thoughts race. When I fall asleep, within the first 10-20min I am already thrown into a super vivid nightmare of the action-adventure genre. The nightmares wake up me all night long, and sometimes I have to stay up for a few minutes to make sure I can reset to a different nightmare. I just quit the melatonin completely a week or two ago and I’m not really seeing any results. I sleep about 5 hours a night over 6 hours, and before that I lay in bed for about 3 hours. 

How long should I expect to keep suffering before the nightmares lessen? Can I try another sleep aid, such as valerian root? Should I ask my doctor for anxiety medicine so I can meditate, and is there a safe no-nausea option? 

I have tried these things by the way: 
- Sudafed vs none (congestion) 
- nasal spray vs none (congestion) 
- videos (usually asmr or food reviews) vs none
- weed vs none 
- alcohol vs none 
- caffeine earlier vs none 
- clothes vs naked 
- black out curtain vs none 
- different blankets/sheets 
- don’t eat before bed  
- share a bed vs alone 
- my bed vs not my bed 
- natural schedule vs alarms 
- (probably forgetting a few more)

1pt0lix,I just needed a Puffy Mattress and science to finally achieve quality sleep.,"I am 29 (M) living in Colorado, and for the past 11 years of my life, I have not really achieved good sleep. I tried taking melatonin as it is over the counter in my state, which helped, but every time I wake up, I don't feel well-rested, which has frustrated me for years. Was I thinking what the problem is then? My girlfriend suggested that I consult with a specialist.  
  
Last year, I visited the Colorado Sleep Institute for a consultation and spoke with Dr. Sanders, PA-C, to determine the cause of my sleep quality issues. After the test, they listed the following to achieve what I want.

  
I underwent the sleep test, and it seemed I am not an insomniac, so they focused on my environment, rather than the sleep itself. They drilled it down to 3 aspects that they determined were a problem, which is why I am not reaching REM sleep:

  
Sleeping Hours: My routine before I sleep is playing video games or now talking with my girlfriend, which can take hours, as Dr. Sanders said. I developed Dry Eyes, also known as digital eyestrain, which is caused by blue light drying out the eyes. He said not everyone can be affected by this, it's just my routine of straining my Eyes for years. I need to rest my eyes for an hour before going to sleep.

  
Sleeping Area: Dr. Sanders was laughing his head off when he found out that I hadn't changed my mattress in so long that the bed had already caved in. I never thought that you needed to change mattresses once they're dented. So, I bought a new mattress. I'd seen Puffy Mattress ads before and the reviews seemed legit, so I went with a Puffy Royal. My goodness, it's like sleeping on a cloud. It's incredibly soft to touch and remarkably calm when you sleep on it. I'm a side sleeper and run hot at night—this thing actually stays cool, which I didn't expect from something this soft. I didn't think I was missing out on something like this. Are all new mattresses like this?

  
Never Eat Before Sleeping: Since I was gaming and talking to my girlfriend before going to sleep, I tend to snack. Chips, Jerky, and Dr. Sanders said this is a significant setback with my sleep because my digestive system is going overtime and thus giving out hormones that will wake me up or let me sleep outside of your sleep cycle, which can disrupt your quality of sleep.  
  
Adjusting those three things has slowly improved my sleep. It's challenging in the first few months, especially the gaming aspect. I just bought Expedition 33, and oh my goodness, it's hard to stop playing it once you start. The mattress helped a lot, actually forcing myself to sleep was a breeze when I was laying on the Puffy Mattress. Having something so comfy to sleep in really deterred me from playing for longer hours. I even started napping from time to time. My girlfriend was so overjoyed that she felt that I was more present when talking to her. She also slept on the mattress and couldn't believe how comfortable it was.

  
PS: My GF said that all that the doctor said was common sense, but I was an orphan, and nobody told me these things; I just went on with my life. She's looking at getting one too.",1766412896.0,3,13,sleep,sleep

1psx4l3,Clean and scented sheets feel almost necessary for my sleep,"I’ve realized that having clean, fresh-smelling sheets has become almost non-negotiable for me when it comes to sleeping well. If my bedding doesn’t feel clean and cozy, I toss and turn way more and have trouble feeling fully relaxed and usually wake up drained even if I sleep for 8 hours. 

I see it as part of basic sleep hygiene now, similar to showering before bed or keeping the room cool. I recently changed my detergent and noticed that scent and freshness stick around longer on sheets, so I’ve been even using Laundry Sauce pods, which made me realize how much smell affects my ability to wind down after a day at work or just in general. 

That said, I don’t want to become dependent or feel like I can’t sleep unless everything is perfect. I’m trying to balance this by focusing on other things too: consistent bedtimes, airing out the room daily, rotating sheets more often, and keeping my sleep space simple and calm.

I physically cant bring myself to get up, ive tried to put my alarm in another room, let light in to my room, no screens before bed, meditation etc. and literally nothing seems to work. 

im at university rn and only have to be there about two times a week so I sleep till 11-12pm everyday and it bothers me a lot. :/ I really want to get up earlier but I just cant. Today I had to pick up a parcel at 8am so I got up at 7 and it worked perfectly, it just doesnt work without that external „motivation“ and I dont know what else to try. 

Its this split second after waking up in which i dont have control over what im going to do so telling myself the evening before to „just get up“ without thinking about it / putting my feet on the ground as soon as the alarm rings doesnt work at all. 

I go to bed early and have an established evening routine that ive „perfected“ over the years because this isnt a new issue. 

i also feel like i might sleep too much? last night i got almost 12h of sleep and its a minimum of 9h per night. (just not when i have an appointment etc.) 

Ive tried to make up external motivation myself like reading my favorite book or gaming after waking up as a „reward“ for getting up early, but if it isn’t something like a doctor’s appointment or meeting someone it doesn’t work at all.

is anyone else struggling with this and found a solution?

All I did was wash everything - pillowcases, duvet cover, sheets, mattress protector. Vacuumed the pillows and mattress, flipped it. That's it. But the difference was more noticeable than I expected.
Looking back, I probably haven't actually deep cleaned my mattress in like 3 years even though I change my sheets weekly. All that accumulated dust and whatever else was probably affecting my breathing the whole time without me realizing it.

1psspdo,I haven't woke up properly in 8 years,"Hello! For starters I'm new to reddit and figured I'd come here to see if I can finally figure something out! For reference to the title I'm 20 years old and this started when I was around 12. I feel like this problem has took over my life. I suppose i should start off with some backstory about me. 

I've always been a pretty active guy, sports throughout school and working out to stay in shape as well as pretty alright eating habits I'd say. I've always been proportionate when it came to height and weight if that makes sense. When I was younger I did have video game addictions but who didn't? My sleep habits have always been shitty since I was around 12, I never had a consistent sleep time and never really have. I've tried setting bed times and it never works and I never stay consistent. Especially since I was staying up sneaking video games when I should've really been in bed. I didn't do it every night of course some nights I did just lay down and relax until I would eventually pass out.

 eventually my parents had begun to notice i would not get up in the mornings. Still, thinking back to it that would seem normal for a 6th grader who didn't care for school. But it only got worse throughout the years. I physically could not wake up in the morning without feeling like a complete zombie. Even if I was getting 4-5, 6-7, or 8-9 hours of sleep
(tried all of them many times) I would wakeup in the morning and either immediately snooze my alarm or I'd become so angry at just the thought up getting up for my day. I've even tried shock bracelets, the alarms that require photos, math, voice activation. None of the things I've listed work for me because either the alarm doesn't wake me up, or if it does ill literally delete the app. I've tried different medications and to be honest I'm a pretty heavy pot user as I started that at around 19. 

I know this post is so jumpy back and forth but please bare with me because this is very hard for me to explain.

This has caused problems between me and my family, lover, friends and more. It's caused me to almost lose jobs and fail college courses due to attendance. I can't keep this up cause I literally can't live like a normal person.

1psiqjh,Sleep through the night doesn't work anymore after being underweight for a while,"I have a small problem that you might be able to help me with. I wasn’t paying enough attention on nutritions last year and ended up underweight. I had a lot of other issues as well. By now, I’ve regained the weight I lost - but unfortunately, my sleep hasn’t recovered yet.

**Before:**  
I didn’t even know what sleep hygiene was. I always stayed up too late, rarely fell asleep easily, always had to set an alarm, and when it went off I had to force myself out of bed. I could easily sleep 8 hours - but since it was hard to fall asleep, I only did it at the weekend, and I never had to go to the bathroom at night.

**Now:**  
I practice good sleep hygiene and usually fall asleep without a problem. I also go to bed earlier than I used to and usually read a bit beforehand - works perfectly for me. Unfortunately, the night is usually over very quickly. I sleep very restlessly, often wake up between 4 and 6 a.m., and then have trouble falling back asleep. Most of the time I also have to go to the bathroom. Sure, it could be age-related, but even my father and grandfather usually sleep through the night without needing to pee. I went to the doctor about this, but they basically just shrugged and wanted to prescribe me an app (da fuq?) that explains sleep hygiene.

I maintain a pretty balanced diet now. Nevertheless, I still have other symptoms of undernutrition, such as no feeling of fullness and no libido. Maybe better sleep will return at some point as well. But only sleeping 5–6 hours for over a year now is really exhausting, especially since I don’t take naps during the day. Do you have any ideas for this specific situation?

I had an 18 hour drive ahead of me and the previous evening I only had 3 hours of sleep. It was festive season and people on the highway drive like maniacs. About 300km to my destination, something really weird happened.

I started experiencing what I can only describe as a dissociative episode or a lucid like state of consciousness. A voice in my head kept saying ""just let go, everything will be fine, you'll just wake up from this dream"" - it was telling me to let go of the steering wheel and crash. It was genuinely trying to persuade me.

I had to fight this thought and eventually pulled over to rest for 10 minutes. I felt like I was tripping.

* Is this a normal symptom of severe sleep deprivation?
* Has anyone else experienced intrusive thoughts like this while exhausted?

1psehpv,The Intriguing Puzzle of Sleep,"Sleep has always struck me as one of life's peculiar enigmas. Here we are, vibrant and productive, then suddenly we need to shut off for several hours every day. Just to exist, to stay alive and healthy. The mind especially seems to crave these darkness-drenched hours of rest as much as the body does.

A few nights ago, I was laying in bed, tucked in and cozy, thinking about this. The quiet night, my partner softly snoring next to me. I was relishing this ritual of sleep, knowing that in a few moments, I would slip from consciousness into dreamland. An abrupt departure from reality into the fantastical realms constructed by my subconscious.

How does our brain function during these periods of slumber? And more importantly, is it just rest that we need, or is there something profoundly integral occurring during our hours of sleep? Is it not just repair and rest, but possibly a form of mental and spiritual processing too?

1psc9iq,Is a heated blanket really safe for elderly family members at night?,"My mom gets really cold at night, so I was considering a heated blanket. I know some people worry about having it on all night especially for older adults.

We tried a Costway heated blanket that has an auto shut-off and adjustable digital heat settings. She can set it to a comfortable temperature and sleeps well through the night. From what I can tell, the warmth is even across the bed, and it uses very little electricity. The fabric is soft, so it’s cozy without feeling like it’s too hot.

For caregivers or anyone with elderly family members: how do you usually keep them warm safely at night? Do you let heated blankets run all night, or do you turn them off after a few hours?",1766338975.0,3,7,sleep,sleep
1psc71k,How to not sleep?,"Hey Reddit, I'm thinking about staying awake as long as possible to push into sleep deprivation and trigger hallucinations—just out of curiosity to see what my brain comes up with when it's totally exhausted. I've read that after 24-48 hours without sleep, people start getting perceptual distortions, and beyond 72 hours it can get into full-on visual or auditory hallucinations, like seeing shadows moving, hearing whispers, or even complex stuff that feels super real.
I'm curious if anyone has tips for staying awake effectively (caffeine strategies, activities to avoid crashing, ways to fight microsleeps, etc.) without totally wrecking myself too fast. Also, what did your hallucinations look like when you hit that point—mild stuff like patterns/shadows, or wilder things? And how long did it take for you?
On the brain side, I know sleep deprivation messes with neurotransmitters like dopamine (which ramps up and can cause psychosis-like symptoms), disrupts the prefrontal cortex (impairing judgment and reality-checking), and basically throws the whole system into chaos—leading to mood swings, paranoia, delusions, and those hallucinations as the brain tries to fill in gaps from exhaustion. Studies show it can mimic acute psychosis after several days, but usually resolves with sleep. Still, it's risky—impaired cognition like being drunk, higher chance of accidents, and potential to worsen underlying mental health stuff.

1ps9rdh,🌙 There’s something I learned after years of lying awake at night:,"Your brain isn’t sabotaging your sleep… it’s working.
During the day it stays quiet.
At night, when everything finally slows down,
it opens all the tabs it didn’t get to touch:
• decisions
• fear about the future
• “did I do enough?”
• “what if I fail?”
• unfinished thoughts
The problem isn’t the thoughts.
The problem is trying to sleep without understanding what’s happening.
Once I understood how the brain works at night, everything changed.
I stopped fighting sleep.
I stopped forcing calm.
I stopped blaming myself.
I realized: the brain needs closure and safety, not pressure.
That’s why I put together a small, free guide explaining:
• why the mind gets loud at night
• what actually triggers nighttime overthinking
• how to calm the brain before getting into bed
• how to stop the 2AM mental meetings
No hacks.
No medication talk.
Just understanding — and kindness toward yourself.
If this sounds like you,
comment “send” or “interested” and I’ll share it.
Rest starts with understanding,
not control. 💙",1766332718.0,1,0,sleep,sleep
1ps9c72,Waking up and falling asleep 3-4 times a night,"I've been experiencing sleep problems (maintenance insomnia) since last August, which started suddenly without any reason after having had a perfect sleep pattern (earbuds, sleep mask, cool room, regular physical activity, proper diet. Furthermore, I was able to have 2+ coffees per day and caffeine tablets on top of that...) since forever.

Despite the fact I've always had the habit to wake up in the middle of the night to go to the loo, just since last August I've been experiencing the random difficulty of falling back asleep again.
I can tell it's definitely improving, and I can have now 2-4 very good nights as before (7.5-9 hours); however, now my body has the tendency of switching on (waking up) and switching off (falling asleep) continuously through the night and it's now always related to dreaming.

I’ve always noticed this tbh. Like I’ve always had nights where I felt restless for the first half of the night, but then I’d fall asleep again at 3 or so and still feel great. 

Now I’ve noticed my sleep tracking wearable actually confirms this. My time of night with lowest HR is always in the latter half. But I wonder if this is actually just a norm for me or if this is something to be fixed. 

I have started cutting off blue light before bed, take magnesium, no late eating, reading right before sleeping, etc. it’s hard to tell if any of this has made a big difference but I don’t think so. 

Maybe the not eating 3 hours before bed is one thing I’m least consistent with (have toddlers at home so it’s hard sometimes).

It's totally random if i wake up feeling good or like i havent slept for a week. My eyes itches, my jaw sometimes feel sore, i'm dissy, and absolutly no energy at all, feel hot. This usually goes 2-3 days bad, 2-3 days good, but no pattern at all. Sometimes i wake up to go pee, but also fall a sleep pretty fast again, when i first lay down in bed i also usally sleep within 15-30minutes. 

So everything SEEMS normal but the outcome is very different and random. I have been tested for sleep apnea and they said no signs at all, in fact it looked great. I've been on brintellix (for depression) and quateapin/seroquel for sleep problems (because some years ago i sleep even worse and could not fall/stay a sleep at all) and quateapin really helped with this.

 The last 6 weeks i have been tapering of quateapin (was only on 50mg which is a very low dose to begin with), to see if this had anything to do with my problems, but also no signs of improvement.

1pryrlq,I haven't had a good night's sleep in years after the military and nothing helps,"I used to be the heaviest sleeper. I could sleep soundly and peacefully through everything all before the military. I went on one combat deployment and spent 8 years in the service in total. After getting out I was diagnosed with PTSD, among other things from our deployment. 

Now my sleep life sucks. Ive been through medications, therapy, and even did a sleep study and now sleep with a cpap. The therapy was just too obvious of advice, the therapist seemed like she was just reading from a script, while she would ask questions of my disturbances it did not seem like she considered them. The best two meds that seemed to help were either seroquel or ambian, but they work almost too well. Like I could sleep for 10 hours even at low doses and the rebound effects would cause my insomnia to worsen. I hate having to take medicine but I'm just at my wits end. 

I can usually fall asleep easily but I'll wake up sometimes not even 2 hours later with racing energy, like I just woke up from a power nap and bad anxiety. It becomes impossible sometimes to fall back asleep, and I usually succumb to removing my cpap mask which helps. I think maybe sometimes the mask is giving me a bit of claustrophobia which is bolting me awake some of the times but it doesnt inherently bother me as a device. So this is just more of a thought than anything conclusive. I wake up to anything and everything as well, I could hear a car go by and I'm up, a gust of wind, my girlfriend simply turning in her sleep, and I'm up. I get startled too easily it seems. I have put a white noise machine on at night now which seems to help with some of the noise disturbances. 

One big difference between when I used to sleep well, in the past, and now is I never actually feel fully asleep. I remember sleep feeling so deep and I would dream so hard I would not even realize I was actually sleeping if that makes any sense? Now I can physically feel the time passing  most of the times, I am always aware my eyes are closed and my body is resting but it never feels like ""official sleep"".

When I can get back to sleep and eventually I wake back up for the day hours later I'm just sluggish, my brain fog makes me feel like I have dementia, I've become irritable, butI'm afraid to get on sleep meds again and I'm just trying to think of options. I'm so physically and mentally exhausted, yet I can't get good rest. I just feel so wired up consistently and always on edge. 

Here are some environmental factors that I know have a negative impact but I cannot do much about

1. I work a high stress job in RF (radio frequency technician) that I cannot make mistakes in which can lead to dire consequences if I get sloppy and people cannot communicate.While the consequences are unlikely it can also happen very easily. I have to be able to retain alot of information and recall it quickly but if I am exhausted it becomes very difficult.

2. The economy has me stressed out. I lay awake stressed out about money a good bit. I'm finally making okay money but I have a bad habit of spiraling because everything feels like it could just collapse at any given moment. 2 or 3 years from now if things stay the same I'll have a better sense of a safety net. I have an intense fear of losing everything, partly because I grew up without much. I am discussing this in therapy. 

3. While my PTSD is treated, I dont know if I'll ever get past this overbearing sense of hypervigilance.

Lately I have the worst time of my life trying to fall asleep. I am 31(M) and never ever had sleeping issues before 26th of December. I did had a severe trauma losing a parent 7 years ago for which I took antidepressants until August 2025.

  
A bit of a story. On 26th of December i caught a really bad flu. This flu made it so I couldn't properly breath so my body went into a panic mode for air gasps. My fiance solved this pretty quickly and I went back to bed after breathing exercises. Since that day my sleep quality still dropped to an all time low. I can't fall asleep properly anymore without waking up with heart palpitations. My fiance says that sometimes I do drift off because I lightly snore she can recognise this but then after a few minutes to +-30 minutes I jolt back up. I have been starting to get major anxiety about this too. 

''what if this becomes chronic or starts affecting my daily routines''. 

These thoughts obviously do not help with trying to fall asleep but they are very real to me. This weekend I did manage to get some sleep but only after 4AM-5AM. I slept until 11AM-12PM which is not ideal obviously especially not during a working week.

  
To summarize - I cannot fall asleep properly or wake up randomly after a good 30 minutes. When I do fall asleep it is way to late around 4AM-5AM and only for 6 to 7 hours. I am starting to lose my mind and tomorrow I got a doctors appointment and the day after I start up talks with my therapist...it is getting really frustrating and I have massive respect for everyone who dealt with this for longer than I am.",1768186412.0,3,1,insomnia,sleep

first it was one night without. another time 2. And then my body decided for the next 4 days i wouldnt sleep. felt like i had a iv drip of cocaine the whole time. copious amounts of weed didnt do anything except calm me.

Now i havent completed my last year of school. my hairs gone. and i have dark face marks on already very dark skin. its like im a whole different person.
The walls have static and the sky has a chowder character pattern. i have to accept my heart skips beats but im not dying. my body feels like its buzzing or my skin has a thin layer of something over it. my heads always warm. 

dont get me started on the medicine choosing when to work and when i get to go to school sedated with no sleep.
  
and for fucks sake. the one day you get a sliver of good sleep. insomni gon make you pay for a week.

1qaawnb,"panic / looping thoughts after olly sleep gummies, has anyone experienced this?","hello, i’m posting this because i’m honestly weirded out and hoping i’m not alone.

for some background, i do have anxiety and i’ve always had trouble sleeping, which is why i wanted to try and take sleep gummies.

i took olly sleep gummies last night and fell asleep, but less than 2 hours later i woke up in the middle of the night in a really disturbing mental state. before i was even fully awake, my mind was stuck on this image of a never-ending spiral or circle that would not close. no matter what i did, i couldn’t picture a complete circle, it just kept looping endlessly.

it wasn’t just a thought, it felt like my brain was forcing the image on me. i was half asleep and talking to myself internally, begging it to stop, but i couldn’t interrupt it until i fully woke myself up. trying to lay back down or even turning my head made it worse. it genuinely made me feel like i was losing my mind.

this has happened once before a few nights ago, and i’m pretty sure it was also after taking the olly gummies. that time, i woke up feeling a really weird left/right difference in my body, like i could physically feel one side more than the other, and hit the difference between each side. which also freaked me out and made me force myself awake before going back to sleep. 

once i sat up, kept the lights on, and got on my phone to try to distract myself, it slowly got better, and i eventually fell asleep again.

has anyone else experienced:
	•	panic or intrusive looping thoughts when waking up from melatonin?
	•	hypnagogic imagery like spirals or unfinished shapes?
	•	weird body sensations or dissociation during sleep transitions?

especially curious if anyone has had this specifically with olly sleep gummies. this is my first time ever trying them but these reactions feel intense and really unsettling that i think im already done with them.

1qaa547,Psychological side effects?,"Has anyone experienced psychological side effects from prolonged sleep deprivation? If so, how long did it take to resolve once sleep resolved?

One month ago I had a severe panic attack that was the catalyst for insomnia for the entire past month. It triggered rolling panic attacks and hypnic jerks that caused me to jolt awake every time I would start to drift off to sleep along with a massive rush of adrenaline/panic. I would only sleep for a few minutes to maybe an hour at a time. I had this severely for 8 days. In those 8 days, I did sleep through the night 2 or 3 nights because my body would hit a point of exhaustion. When I'd sleep through the night I'd wake up and feel mostly normal and functional but then the anxiety would take over again. 

After this run of insomnia I had like 6 nights where I slept, most of which was through the night, some with small awakens. During the day I was feeling what I believe is dissociation. I would feel disoriented, namely having the sensation like I didn't know where I was. On the days I didn't feel like I didn't know where I was, I felt brainy foggy and detached. 

I had another big panic attack and that triggered another few days of constant panic attacks and only sleeping short periods of time. Somewhere in all of this, I took Hydroxizine for a few days and it triggered my heart to go into an irregular rhythm. I genuinely thought I was going to die and had to be rushed to the ER via ambulance. Needless to say, this added to my overall experience of fear and anxiety. 

I've been able to sleep through the night for 3 or 4 nights again and have been yoyoing between feeling extremely groggy/brain foggy/disoriented/disconnected and having clearness and moments of hyper awareness. I keep having intrusive thoughts like I will see or hear a family member and imagine myself hurting them or feeling anxiety and seeing a mental image of me running around frantically. It just happens without my control and is disturbs me.  Sometimes I feel like I'm going to go insane, sometimes I start to feel detached from myself and get scared I'm going to develop other personalities. Overall, I feel unstable mentally. 

I don't think I have psychosis as I have remained aware of reality and what is a thought vs what is a fear. I haven't developed hallucinations or delusions or anything. 

I've had very small episodes of this panic and insomnia stuff happen before but they all stopped within a few days and I went back to normal sleep and not sleep functioning pretty quickly. This time that's not happening. I'm honestly scared. I hope that with more normal sleep things will fall back into their normal place but I'm scared I've gone insane this time.

1qa8e23,Progress with insomnia,"Hello insomnia community. I wanted to share my struggle with insomnia and what has helped me make significant progress. 7-8 years ago I began waking up at night struggling to go back to sleep for an hour or more, which then evolved into multiple hours and ultimately nights where I’d only sleep 2-3 hours a night in the early morning, trapping me in a vicious cycle of worrying tremendously about sleep, hating myself for not being able to go back to sleep, etc. I tried CBT but didn’t stick to it, patterns came back and I tried psychiatric meds but couldn’t take the side effects. Ultimately I decided to take the CBT more seriously and over a few monthsit has worked wonders. Additionally, I have been wearing a fit bit which tracks my sleep and it has actually reinforced the CBT by allowing me to see my sleep architecture and understand that im good with 6 hours of efficient sleep. Key takeaways:

Easier said then done, but you have to stop caring - literally think about anything else besides sleep when in bed. Even if it’s something else that’s bothering you, as long as it’s not sleep - it’s progress. I’ve seen this called radical acceptance, and acceptance is the key “I’m going to lay here and not care what happens” 

Get out of bed when your alarm is off, and generally stop spending as much time is bed. Once you dial in the amount of sleep you need, try to stick to that window. 

Don’t long naps. This is a hard one, but late naps especially will zap your sleep drive, do what you can so stay busy so you have less time to nap 

Dispel the idea that incremental amounts of sleep matter “I’ve been in bed for 9 hours and only slept three let me try and get another 30 minutes from my alarm and I’ll be much. Efficiency is far more important than quantity when it comes to resetting your brain.

I’ll probably never be as “good of a sleeper” as others but I feel like I’ve turned a nightly occurrence into something more manageable. 

I hope this helped!

I kept thinking: I used to fall asleep in the car. In class. On the floor during sleepovers.

Now I'm dead tired all day and the second my head hits the pillow I'm just... awake.

Magnesium. No screens. Same bedtime every night.

I get into bed, close my eyes, and my brain instantly starts a meeting. It’s not even always stress or worries, a lot of the time it’s just ideas. Especially when I’m excited about a hobby project. My mind keeps going like: “I could still do this… what if I try that… tomorrow I’ll…” and then it’s 2am and I’m still staring at the ceiling.



And even when I do fall asleep, I’m a super light sleeper. I’ll wake up in the middle of the night and once my brain grabs onto \*anything\*, I’m suddenly awake-awake. Like, wide awake. Sometimes I’m up after 3 hours and the next day is just rough: foggy brain, low energy, everything feels harder than it should.



Stuff I’m trying to fix:

\- inconsistent sleep schedule

\- falling asleep with screens/media I know a bad habit but it helps to fall asleep



What I’m trying next:

\- a very simple sleep diary for 2–3 weeks to spot patterns but I really don’t want it to turn into another “project”



Questions:

1) What helped you calm racing thoughts when it’s more “ideas/excitement” than anxiety?

2) What do you do when you wake up at night and feel weirdly alert?

3) If you kept a sleep diary: what were the \*minimum\* fields that were actually worth tracking (paper vs digital)? Did tracking alone help, or only once you changed specific habits?

Since then I have gotten 1 hour some nights and 2 hours on a couple others. On day 5 I went to the clinic and they prescribed me hydroxyzine. Didn't really do anything. So the next day I tried melatonin and magnesium glycinate. I *did* fall asleep but only for an hour. I tried it again the following night and didn't sleep at all. Went to the clinic again and they gave me generic Xanax. Btw I should point out my living condition is freezing right now, I have the option to sleep on a couch at my uncle's house, but my aunt stays awake into the am with lights/movies on. I cannot sleep unless it's silent and dark. So it all started me choosing freezing over lights/noise since I know damn well I wouldn't be able to sleep through that (I had work in the morning). Anyway out of desperation I went to my buddy's house to see if I could sleep on his couch, he was fine with it. But I couldn't sleep, his kids would scream, and cry during the night. Which tbh idk if made a difference anyway since my mind REFUSES to shut off. After a few nights staying on my buddy's couch I did manage to wrack up about 4 hours of sleep over 3 days. Yesterday my dad on the phone said ""you can try my couch, there's not much noise over here at night"" so I went over there praying to God I may get some sleep at last. I slept 2 hours roughly and woke up to one of my dad's cats meowing very loud. I was wearing decent ear plugs and it was blasting through them. The cat would not stop meowing. So at 3:30 am after I just couldn't bare it anymore I got in my car and drove home to my uncle's house. I went to my uncle's couch since everyone was at work or leaving soon. So I was hopeful I would maybe be able to fall asleep after everybody left. But I couldn't. I tried and tried. No dice. So now I went to the store and bought some alcohol and if I can't fall asleep in a couple hours I'm going to drink myself to sleep. Just wondering if/how many people have used alcohol out of desperation to finally sleep. Did it help?

One time I almost fainted during an Exam but good thing I manage to drag myself into the clinic where a doctor there checked on me and ruled out that I have an Insomia. The doctor gave me some prescription of sleeping suplements but honestly, It doesn't work on me... I stop taking those because of some feedback around me that taking those are harmful to my own body.

Everytime I sleep during night, I have may taken some sleep for like an hour or two but I'm always jolting myself back awake and not being able to sleep for the rest of the night. 

It is affecting my life now and It is so hard to work around it. Like having blinds or eyemask, off screentime, earplugs even meditating and breathing exercise. All it was just to make me yawn but my brain is still active. 

For those experience things like this, can you gave me some advice on what should I do? If I really need to visit a doctor, What kind of doctor should I go seek help? ",1768087225.0,1,1,insomnia,sleep

1q9ckq9,"More Salt, Not Less","I was on prescription meds for sleep for about 15 years. Told my worthless doctor I lay awake in the middle of the night for 2+hours and BOOM xanax prescribed. No questions, no nothing. Here's a pill. That started me on drug after drug. They would work for awhile and then stop. My final concoction was zoloft + trazodone + ½ unisom. Finally I said I'm done. I weaned off (Plant People WonderSleep really helped me do that). Then I got on Reddit.

Shout out to u/Candid-Ad-8470 for his post on electrolytes. I gave it a go and I SLEPT. I couldn't believe it. First time sleeping in 15 years with only the help of something that is actually good for me. But I didn't like the salt content--1000mg (43% DV). Salt is bad, right? I already don't watch my salt intake I probably shouldn't have any more. I thought it was weird that it tasted like watermelon ocean water but it was only 43% DV..I was surprised it wasn't way way more than that, given how salty it tasted. I started to wonder if that’s less than half the sodium we’re supposed to have in a day we must need a LOT, not a little—like we’ve been told (by complete good for nothing worthless doctors). But I wasn't having any negative effects, no swelling or headaches, etc and I was sleeping. Weird. Then I went to the park and this guy had a sticker on his Nalgene that said ""MORE SALT, NOT LESS"".. interesting. That night I consulted ChatGPT about that sticker.

So guys, all that stuff about 'salt is bad for you' is total BS. The only people that need to watch their salt intake are people with high blood pressure, sedentary people, and highly processed food diets. Watching your salt intake backfires for people who don't eat much processed foods, drink lots of water, exercise, eat clean, and... wait for it.....""HAVE INSOMNIA, ANXIETY, PALPITATIONS, DIZZINESS, OR NIGHT WAKINGS."" Adding salt to homecooked meals is not bad. It barely raises your sodium levels. When you drink a lot of plain water you are diluting sodium, potassium, and magnesium (!!). When sodium levels are low, other minerals like magnesium don't work properly. Have you taken magnesium supplements and thought it made no difference? Probably because your sodium was low.

Here's what I take now (all found at walmart):

LMNT (or another electrolyte that contains 500-1000mg sodium; just get one with 1000 bc you can always take ½ a packet)

Magnesium Glycinate 300mg

L-theanine 200mg

You will know if this isn't your solution because you will drink the electrolyte and have negative effects like a headache (1-4 hours later, not next day), swelling, extreme thirst. If you have that then your body had enough sodium already and didn't need any more. For me, I had no negative side effects which means my body used the sodium. If I get any negative effects (because I don't eat the same everyday) I will go down to ½ packet. Or on the days where I eat poorly or go out to eat I will take ½ packet.

Chat GPT even told me when I should take each for a 9:30/10pm bedtime (7-8pm LMNT, 8:30- Magnesium, 9:15- L-theanine). I was doing it all at once, which wasn't ideal.

If you try this I want to know if it helped you! Good luck guys. Stay salty 🙂",1768072059.0,37,44,insomnia,sleep

My doctors passed me through half a dozen medications, none worked for very long. Eventually I ended up with zolpidem (ambien) that afforded me at least some 4 hours of sleep per night. Still not enough of course. What saved me was a combination of pipamperone and trazodone. Within weeks of taking them, I slept normally and could stop the zolpidem.

1q8qait,If you have insomnia — you’re not alone,"When I experienced insomnia for the first time, the hardest part wasn’t just the nights without sleep.
The fear stayed with me during the day too.
What scared me most was the feeling that I was completely alone in it — that no one around me had ever gone through something similar, and that maybe something was deeply wrong with me.
With time, I realized it wasn’t a personal failure or something “broken” inside me.
It was a temporary state, often triggered by stress, and what helped the most was not forcing sleep, but helping my body and mind feel safer and more relaxed.
Later, during another period of insomnia, I discovered that people I knew had experienced similar struggles — even if they talked about it differently or much later.
And just knowing that was surprisingly comforting. It made the fear a little quieter.
If you’re dealing with insomnia right now and feeling isolated or scared, please know this:
you’re not alone, and this experience doesn’t define you or mean something is wrong with you.

1q8lq87,Exercise suddenly causes complete insomnia (even yoga). 50F. Cortisol / nervous system issue?,"Not looking for medical advice — just personal experiences and ideas from people who’ve dealt with similar sleep issues.

Hi everyone,  
I really need help because this situation is starting to scare me and I don’t know what direction to take anymore.

I’m a 50-year-old woman. I’ve worked out consistently for years — **6 days a week, 30–60 minutes**. Mostly **HIIT, weight lifting, and cardio**. Exercise has always been a huge part of my life, mentally and physically. I never had sleep issues related to workouts before.

About **a year ago**, I noticed my sleep became lighter. I’d wake up a few times at night but could fall back asleep. Annoying, but manageable.

About **6 months ago**, things got worse.  
I started having trouble falling asleep after workout days. I discovered that if I took **200 mg of Advil**, I could usually sleep. I didn’t love relying on it, but it worked.

Then about **3 months ago**, even that started failing.  
I shortened my workouts drastically — **10 minutes only**, very light. Still couldn’t fall asleep without Advil. Eventually, even Advil stopped working reliably.

This week has been the worst.  
I only did **10 minutes of gentle yoga** — no HIIT, no weights, nothing intense. And still… **zero sleep**. Not light sleep. Not broken sleep. Just lying there all night wired, heart racing, body buzzing. Even Advil didn’t help. It was terrifying.

Here’s the weird (and important) part:  
➡️ **If I don’t work out at all, I sleep like a baby.**  
Deep sleep. No problem falling asleep. No awakenings.

That’s why I strongly suspect **exercise-induced cortisol spikes** or some nervous system/hormonal issue. It feels like my body can’t “come down” anymore after physical stress — even mild stress.

Some additional info:

* I **cannot take magnesium** — it actually causes insomnia for me (yes, really).
* I don’t drink caffeine late.
* I don’t train at night.
* This does NOT feel like anxiety-driven insomnia. It feels physical.
* I am not willing to accept “just stop exercising forever” — exercise is a huge part of my mental health and identity.

I’m freaking out because:

1. This keeps getting worse, not better.
2. Even yoga now triggers it.
3. I feel like my body is betraying me.
4. I’m terrified I’ll have to give up exercise entirely just to sleep.

My questions:

* Has anyone experienced **exercise-induced insomnia** or cortisol-related insomnia?
* Could this be **perimenopause / hormonal sensitivity to stress**?
* Is this a **nervous system dysregulation** issue?
* Are there specific strategies that helped you *continue exercising* without destroying sleep?
* Is this reversible, or am I pushing myself into chronic insomnia?

I’m open to lifestyle changes, timing changes, supplements (except magnesium), therapy approaches, nervous system work — anything. I just need real experiences and advice, because right now I feel completely stuck and scared.

Thank you so much if you read this. Even knowing I’m not alone would help.

If you’ve dealt with this and found a way back to exercise without destroying sleep, I’d really appreciate hearing your experience.

1q8cd4y,I sleep 10-14 hrs a day without Wellbutrin. I have moderate severe insomnia when taking Wellbutrin. Now what?,"I starred taking wellbutrin to promote wakefulness because even though I was already taking adderall (for ADHD), I could easily sleep right through it. Since I was in my teens, I could sleep within minutes of my head hitting the pillow, stress would make me sleepy, and I could even fall asleep at a concert, I could get a peaceful 9 hrs of sleep. But I was also always falling asleep during class, always desperately searching for a place to nap during the day (even benches outside on my school campus, hallways, etc), falling into microsleep while driving at night, it affected my studying, relationships, etc. I had a very hard time staying awake no matter how much sleep I got at night.

Welbutrin allowed me to need much less sleep. After 10 days of taking it, finals week came around, and I found that even the tiniest amount of stress makes it impossible to go to sleep. That 10th day was the first time I ever had insomnia. But at that point in time, the insomnia was much better than hypersomnia. 8 years later, the insomnia is much more frequent as I go through graduate school. I feel like the I am going crazy. Throughout the first several years, the side effect of insomnia was worth it. Although I did implement several medications to try and treat the insomnia. I changed my bedtime habits/minor lifestyle changes.I used to be able to fall asleep to noise, and now I need everything to be 100% quiet. Now I just don't even know anymore.

Like many people with sleep issues, I was taking magnesium supplements to improve my sleep. Over the years, I have tried every form of magnesium trying to find the one that worked for me. 

Eventually after many doctor visits and hours upon hours of researching trying to get the the bottom of what was wrong, I came to the conclusion that magnesium supplements were hurting and making my situation much worse. I found that although all of my blood tests were normal, I had inadequate sodium levels in my body and magnesium was causing this. 

Since discovering this I have stopped magnesium completely and significantly increased my sodium intake, while making sure to get enough potassium in my diet too. Within months I had made a full recovery and now sleep soundly 8 hours a night.

1q8765j,"Chronic fatigue, SSRI antidepressants discontinuation syndrome with Insomnia","Hi. I suffer from anxiety disorder with agoraphobia and insomnia. For around 18 years, I took sertraline, Zoloft 25 mg, and quetiapine 10 mg for sleep. I stopped taking Zoloft three months ago because I felt much better, had a little more energy, and could think and feel things a little better. I feel like these two pills are causing me brain fog, and I have a lot of trouble expressing myself, like speaking or thinking. After three months of stopping the SSRI, I developed strange fever symptoms in the evenings. I feel a bit worse, with a fever of 98.6 F. Sometimes I feel hot, sometimes cold, and I have chills and sweats at night. I learned that this is delayed antidepressant withdrawal syndrome. I consulted a psychiatrist, who gave me Zoloft again to stimulate my brain, and trazodone 25 mg for sleep plus quetapine 25 mg. I've been taking new trazodone pills for a few days, but I slept three hours, and today I've only slept two, and I'm hopeless. I'm 31 years old and constantly feel weak and tired of life. I have no energy to do anything, I'm drowsy and dizzy half the day, barely surviving but I have to work. Now, after a few days, I feel like Zoloft has added the fire additionally, I cannot fall asleep because the drug affects serotonin and stimulates me so can't sleep at all. It probably takes a few weeks for any sleeping pills to work. In the morning, my cortisol spikes, making my blood boil as if I had a lot of energy, and as soon as I get up, I feel like I'm dying inside from lack of sleep. During the day, I feel internal tremors and I'm agitated with a blank mind, just like I always did when I took Zoloft, so it doesn't even surprise me.

I'm not sure if I should call my psychiatrist to ask him to change my pills to something stronger and maybe someone suggest some pills I don't die.",1767962269.0,1,2,insomnia,sleep
1q86wdd,Sleep performance anxiety relapse after period of better sleep,"This week has been incredibly frustrating for me, I feel like I am taking a huge step back in my progress. The short version is that I was doing better with my anxiety about falling asleep (which is layered on top of various other anxieties) and it made the process of trying to sleep more manageable. Unfortunately with school starting up again next week I have been more anxious and stressed out than usual (despite me always doing well in school and understanding logically that there is nothing to be anxious about). This has brought about my fear/anxiety of trying to fall asleep in the past week or so. I know this is a temporary setback but after finally having better sleep for a while it's really hard to go back to staring at the ceiling for hours with no relief and being awake when the sun comes up. 

Now, for the long version. A bit of context here, I have struggled with insomnia for almost a year at this point (11 months). I started seeing a therapist for anxiety which is what I believe is causing my insomnia (my first instance was due to a stressful test being the next day). That was actually over a year ago but at the time it was an anomaly not the norm so I don't think of it as the start of my struggle. My actual insomnia started due to a very stressful class that caused me a lot of anxiety. That semester (spring 2025) was overall chaos and a lot of not sleeping (at all) every night before that class and crashing the next night. My sleep got somewhat better during the summer mostly because I was allowed to sleep in as much as I wanted and I was overall more relaxed. For clarification I usually sleep fine once I fall asleep. I don't typically wake up throughout the night, the issue is falling asleep in the first place. Fall 2025 was a stressful semester too, a pretty hefty workload, but I starting working through some of the contributing factors with my therapist so it was more manageable.

Some of the issues we worked on (and are still working on) are anxiety about perceived threats (like tests), big days or exciting events (like visiting unusual places or something as simple as going to a nice restaurant with my family), anxiety about changes to my routine, sleep performance anxiety (I saw someone use this term on a different post, I'm referring to being anxious about whether I will fall asleep and what will happen if I don't, feeding the cycle.), and feeling responsible for my sleep (despite knowing that I can't make myself fall asleep at will I sometimes forget that it isn't in my control). 

During the fall semester my sleep performance anxiety got a LOT better, and the process of falling asleep stopped being stressful. I will add my sleep schedule was still far from optimal, but I was consistently falling asleep around 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. and waking up for school around 11:45 a.m. I should point out I am in college (dual enrolled) so after the hectic and mentally draining spring semester I switched all my classes to afternoon or evening. There were a few bad days here and there but overall I was feeling a lot more optimistic. 

Winter break rolled around and I went on a few short trips with my family. Unfortunately I've never been good at sleeping in new places, and that combined with all my other anxiety about sleeping led to not really sleeping so during both trips I was fairly exhausted. When I was home my schedule got pushed even further back, to 4:00 or 5:00 a.m. and sleeping until 1:00 or 2:00 p.m. I tried to reset my clock by staying up an entire night and not letting myself sleep until around 8:00 p.m. It was my mistake to not tell my parents to wake me up at a certain time (I sleep through alarms), I expected I would sleep around 10 hours like usual. That didn't happen, I slept 15 hours straight, and gave me a nice migraine the next day. I haven't attempted that since, although I might just stay up tonight because I am leaving the house in 4 hours and I'm not sure it's worth trying to fall asleep just to go through the pain of waking up still exhausted. Overall I am just sad and frustrated at this setback or I guess relapse. It's hard to not sleep and even harder to feel like I am messing up my progress even if I know logically it isn't something I am intentionally doing.

Tonight was particularly bad, and there are a few reasons I am guessing are causing that. First, the overall stress about school starting has been doing a number on my mental space. Second, I am supposed to visit a seafood restaurant I have never been to today which I am excited for but when there is something to look forward to my sleep performance anxiety acts up. I remember one time during the summer there was nothing to impede my sleep except the knowledge that I was visiting an aquarium the next day; I didn't sleep at all. Still enjoyed the aquarium, being able to enjoy things and have fun despite being utterly exhausted is a skill I have acquired through this struggle, but it illustrates how even good exciting things can cause an issue where sleep is concerned. Third, I had some caffeine earlier in the day. It was a small amount and should have been out of my system before I went to try and sleep around 4:00 a.m., but knowing that I had caffeine which I usually don't and that it can prevent sleep was enough to make me wonder if that was tonight's issue thus making me feel guilty. 

It's a temporary setback but still frustrating, I'm so tired of dealing with this. Not resting or not resting well impacts life in so many different ways, much more than most people who don't deal with sleep issues would imagine. Anyway very long post, I just wanted to share for other people who might be going through the same thing.

1q80b20,Z-drugs are worse long term than benzos,"As someone who has been on them for the third time now, for too long, because my stupid GPs won't let me have diazepam and melatonin can only be prescribed by specialists here in the UK, I wish to express why z-drugs are more problematic than benzos are for long term use (not that either of them should be).
The biggest problem with z-drugs is their short life span and middle of the night wakefulness. If you cannot sleep without medication onset and not get back to sleep naturally then these aren't for you. I have woken up within 3 hours on multiple occasions, such as tonight, only to find that I cannot get back to sleep.

Benzos on the other hand, from what I have read, have a much longer half life and therefore most likely to keep you asleep or at least allow you to fall back to sleep.

Both drugs, contrary to what people think, are addictive, cause dependency and cause rebound insomnia as well as chances of seizures if suddenly stopped. Tapering off z-drugs is far more difficult as the downside makes it harder to reduce the medication and still maintain stability. Thus you end up in a vicious cycle of less sleep and rebound insomnia.

I don't care what anyone says, z-drugs are thee worst for chronic insomnia and I'd rather take my chances with benzos. ",1767938137.0,7,81,insomnia,sleep

I am also concerned about how long term use can affect someone's health as I have been on many different medications for over 3 months and back on zopiclone. I can't stress enough how horrible the rebound insomnia is and it frustrates me that the doctors would rather keep prescribing me the same shit that caused issues than give me diazepam which has less chance to cause rebound due to better/longer half life. And before anyone tells me how dependent and addictive they are, let me tell you that for FACT long term use of z-drugs is just as bad and also known to be harmful in regards to brain damage.

Either way I fucked up tonight and can't cope with this shit anymore. I used to fall asleep no probem and without meds.

A happy post for a change.

Today marks a **full year** without a single sleepless night for me, after struggling with chronic insomnia for 12+ years. 365 nights!!!

I received long-term medication last year & it's been nothing but bliss. As someone who has struggled with sleep since early childhood and whose insomnia is not rooted in anxiety, I honestly never in a million years would have expected to reach this milestone.

The change in my physical & mental health has been incredible. I'm honestly so baffled & jealous that many people exist like this by default. I likely won't be able to stay on the meds forever (nor do I want to), but I'm cleared for at least another 6 months & I'll be making the most of it.

1q7qex5,"0 hours of sleep tonight — not panicking, but struggling and confused","Hi everyone. I’m writing this after getting 0 hours of sleep tonight, and I’m honestly just looking for advice or kind words.

My sleep lately has been full of ups and downs, but mostly ups. A few nights ago, I dealt with overthinking and worries, but I learned how to calm myself and eventually fall asleep. Tonight felt very different.

For context, I’m a college student and our classes don’t start until Monday (it’s Friday now). I’ve been at home a lot—doing chores, but not really going out, no hobbies, nothing that truly makes me tired. The past two days, I also took 30-minute to 1-hour afternoon naps, which I think might have affected last night.

I went to bed thinking it would be a normal night. I wasn’t extremely anxious, which is actually a big step for me because I developed insomnia about 5 years ago. I’ve learned to accept it more over time, even though I still struggle.

I was tossing and turning, but instead of panic, it felt like I was controlling and forcing sleep too much. Usually, I fall asleep by imagining fake scenarios that slowly turn into dreams—that’s how I know sleep is coming. But last night, that didn’t work at all. My mind stayed awake, my heart was racing, and I kept flinching. My eyes hurt from being closed for so long, but I still didn’t fall asleep.

It’s around 6am now (I’m from the Philippines), and I’m unsure whether to try sleeping again or just get up and start the day. I’m trying to accept the wakefulness and reminding myself that this isn’t my first sleepless night, but part of me is scared that being “too confident” might just set me up for disappointment again.

I also keep wondering:

1q7mcqk,Has anyone noticed that sleeping with a side/body pillow makes falling asleep feel..easier?,"I'm posting this more out of curiosity than anything else.I've dealt with sleep-onset insomnia and broken sleep for a while now. Nothing extreme, but enough that nights often feel long and restless. One thing I've noticed is that nights feel harder when I'm lying there with nothing ""anchoring"" me - I feel more restless, sometimes oddly lonely or uneasy, even if mentally I'm fine during the day.A while back, I started sleeping on my side with a firm pillow along my body (between legs + against my torso). Later I experimented with making a slightly heavier/denser side pillow for myself. What surprised me was how consistently my sleep improved.
Things I've noticed over time:
Falling asleep feels more natural, less forced
Less tossing and turning
Fewer random wake-ups during the night
Sleep feels more continuous rather than fragmented
I've tried melatonin before - sometimes it helped, sometimes it didn't - but this feels different. More like removing physical restlessness rather than inducing sleep.
I'm not saying this ""treats"" insomnia or works for everyone. I'm just wondering:

Has anyone else felt calmer or less restless sleeping with a body/side pillow?Do you think it's posture,pressure, comfort... or something psychological like feeling less alone at night?
Have weighted blankets or similar things had a comparable effect for you?Curious if this is a common experience or just something specific to my body/sleep pattern.

1q7faq6,Any advice? I genuinely am beginning to fear for my life.,"So about a month ago I started having terrible insomnia. It all started when I tried to sleep over with my girlfriend and I just couldn’t fall asleep.  I think I had a panic attack because of this that day.  Ever since that day I’ve been involuntarily pulling an all nighter about every 3 days.  The days that I don’t pull an all nighter I sometimes sleep 10 hours but sometimes only like 6.  This keeps causing me to feel extremely tired during the day to the point where I’m getting lightheaded and I worry that I’m going to pass out.  But when I feel like this I still can’t sleep.  A lot of the times I’ll feel super calm when trying to sleep too.  I’ll be comfy, calm, and I won’t be thinking about anything.  I’ll be almost asleep but not asleep for like an hour then my body starts to become fully awake again and I lose the feeling like I was maybe going to sleep.  This is only worsening and I’m only feeling worse and worse during the day.  The feeling of body exhaustion and lightheadedness I’m getting during the day is absolutely unbearable and I don’t know how I’m going to keep dealing with it.  I genuinely am worried that I’m going to die if I can’t sleep.  I’ve tried meditations, I’ve tried staying off of blue light before bed, I’ve tried sleeping at different times, I’ve tried melatonin, I’ve tried moving my bed to a different room, I’ve tried getting up for 20-30 minutes when I can’t sleep and then trying again, I’ve trued watching tv to distract my brain, I’ve tried working out more in the day, I’ve tried working out less in the day.

One says not to worry about not falling asleep, so if you can’t sleep, you stay in bed and just rest without thinking about the consequences of not sleeping, in a relaxed way. The idea is to learn not to be anxious about being awake.

  
The other says to get up every 20 minutes if you can’t fall asleep, so that your brain doesn’t associate the bed with staying awake.

1q7cp25,Experience with nightmares and/or headaches as side effects from insomnia meds,"I'm curious if anyone else who has a similar side effect profile can talk about their experience.

I have GAD/panic disorder and anxiety-induced insomnia. I do all the sleep hygiene stuff (no alcohol or caffeine, exercise earlier in the day, no screens before bed, etc etc), and I don't need medication every day - some nights I'm able to fall asleep - but sometimes I have a nighttime panic attack and need to resort to medication so I can get at least some sleep and be functional the next day (I have two young kids and need to get them out the door to school in the morning without barely being able to get out of bed because I'm so anxious I feel like I'm going to vomit).

My problem so far is that it seems that nearly all things that are supposed to help with anxiety/insomnia give me very vivid dreams and frequently nightmares. So even if I manage to get 5-6 hours of sleep (rarely stay asleep longer than that), waking up from a super vivid nightmare that seemed real is unsettling and anxiety-inducing and I start the day off anxious, which doesn't set the stage well for the following night. So far my doc has had me try SSRIs, mirtazapine, zalpelon, and now hydroxyzine, but they all seem to have the same problem. The only exception is trazodone - I was sleeping 6 hours sometimes without the vivid dreams - but getting wicked headaches the next day. My doc has also mentioned doxepin but haven't tried that one yet.

I always feel best when I do manage to sleep without meds, but the no-sleep nights and next days are awful, and I'd rather not have to choose between nightmares and headaches when that happens. If anyone else has had a similar experience, I'd love to hear if something ultimately worked for you (with the usual caveat that I'm not going to take medical advice from strangers on the internet - I have a follow up doctor's appointment next week; sometimes it's just nice to talk to other people going through the same thing).

1q7adeh,How do you “befriend wakefulness” when suffering from extreme hyperarousal/anxiety?,"Warning: Long!

40/F

In November 2024, I had really bad insomnia for a few weeks. This devolved into full-fledged sleep anxiety and I ended up going to inpatient treatment because I felt like I could not control my brain. I was so terrified of not sleeping that it resulted in only sleeping 0-3 hours most nights.

The inpatient treatment SUUUUCKED and was kinda traumatic. They ended up prescribing me 50 mg of Seroquel, but that didn’t work so we bumped it to 100 mg of Seroquel. I actually slept ok the last 2 nights I was there.

When I got home, I had some trouble sleeping again, so I tacked on 100 mg of Trazodone that I had in my bathroom cabinet in addition to the Seroquel. That seemed to do the trick and I got pretty decent sleep from December 2024 - June 2025.

In June, I think I got re-triggered by the summer solstice, because it was a reminder that the dark days of winter were coming again (even tho they were legit months away - just knowing the days were getting shorter again freaked me out). So, I had another insomnia cycle for a week. I reached out to my psychiatrist and asked about adding Quviviq as well, which she agreed to.

The Quviviq actually helped, but I felt like that was a lot of meds just for sleep - in addition to Seroquel and Traz. I also REALLY wanted to get off Seroquel due to weight gain and risk of long term health effects.

I ended up reaching out to a Harvard-trained sleep psychologist.

His whole thing is helping people get off sleeping meds while also teaching Acceptance and Commitment Therapy skills. With his help, I successfully weaned off Seroquel in mid-September.

I then gave it a couple weeks and started to taper Trazodone next (dropping 12.5 mg every 2 weeks). It was going pretty smoothly until I got to 37.5 mg - I suddenly started having sleep maintenance issues and would wake up after 4-5 hours. Then, I dropped to 25 mg and suddenly had full-blown insomnia again. That was around the beginning of December 2025.

Throughout December, I really struggled and had mostly bad nights of sleep. By Christmas, I decided I was going to reverse my Trazodone taper and I went back up to 100 mg.

That helped me get back on track. I started sleeping well again. Since it had been some time since I was on the full 100 mg dose, the daytime grogginess hit me hard. So, I only stayed at that dose for a few days before dropping down to 75 mg for 3 days and then to 50 mg.

I had no issues with that and stayed at 50 mg for maybe 8 days before I was hit with a night of sleep maintenance insomnia on January 4th and woke up after 2 hours of sleep.

That night re-triggered my sleep anxiety again and, after 2 additional nights of minimal sleep, I re-upped the Trazodone back to 100 mg. Unfortunately, this time it hasn’t helped and I’m still experiencing insomnia. For the past few nights, I’ve gotten 0-2 hours of sleep.

Anyway, long story short - throughout this whole experience, I’ve been watching The Sleep Coach School videos and reading Daniel Erichsen’s books, in

addition to working with my sleep psychologist - but I just cannot let go of the sleep anxiety. My tired brain just can’t process rationally. 

I still go about my days as normal, go to work, do things with friends, occasionally go to the gym, etc. I also try to keep a consistent bed time and I don’t try to make up for lost sleep with naps. So, I’m doing all that correctly.

But, my brain literally just cannot stop ruminating about insomnia, especially at night. I try to get up and read or watch TV, but most of the time my brain is still ruminating.

How can I “befriend wakefulness” when my whole body is in perpetual fight or flight mode? I see a bunch of posts and comments here about how following ACT and “befriending wakefulness” was a magic bullet that solved their insomnia… and yet I struggle so much with it.

My sleep psychologist keeps saying he believes in me

and he knows I can get back on track, but it’s been impossible for me to internalize that.

I’m contemplating starting Lexapro, since anxiety does seem to be my core issue. But, of course I’m nervous about that.

1q78639,Wondering if anyone can relate/help,"
Hey everyone — I’m posting because I’m a bit stuck on how to approach this and was hoping someone might have similar experiences or insights.

I’ll try to keep it brief. I’ve never been a great sleeper, especially over the past ~5 years, but my issue was usually falling asleep. During bad periods I’d sometimes use medication (a benzo or zopiclone), usually just for a few days, and things would settle again.

Lately, though, the problem has changed. I do fall asleep, but my experience of sleep feels completely different. Even when I’m asleep, I feel conscious — having extremely vivid dreams and feeling like I could wake up at any moment. After these nights I’m utterly exhausted, in a very specific and unpleasant way. Honestly, it feels worse than when I couldn’t sleep at all and was awake all night.

This is hard to describe, but as I start drifting off my mind begins to spiral with random, uncontrollable thoughts — and it feels like this continues even while I’m “asleep,” never really stopping.

EDIT: One thing I also am getting is a an ""andrenaline dump feeling"" where as I start drifting off i will have a rush of adrenaline. I know this can happen from time to time but this is practically every night mow and quite severe.

The only thing that reliably stops this is zopiclone, which makes me think it’s anxiety-related. That said, I don’t actually feel particularly stressed — certainly not compared to periods in the past when I couldn’t fall asleep at all.

On top of this, I’ve noticed coinciding gut issues: severe bloating, waking with an extremely sore stomach, and a bad taste in my mouth (night-time reflux). Ive found a way to manage this aspect largely with histamine blockers and was hopeful that controlling that would then have a flow on effect to the sleep issue but sadly that doesnt seem to be the case. Im now starting to rely a bit on zipiclone which obviously is an awful idea however I am so mentally drained the next day if I dont do this that im stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Any thoughts or shared experiences would be really appreciated.

It started with waking up randomly multiple times per night, not due to thirst, needing the bathroom, or any obvious trigger. Over time, the awakenings became more frequent and were followed by increasing difficulty falling back asleep. I’ve also noticed a major increase in vivid dreams — sometimes 5–6 in a single night.

Last night, I barely slept at all and couldn’t manage more than about an hour total, even after taking 10 mg of melatonin. I’m so sleep deprived that I’m having trouble thinking clearly and needed AI assistance to write this. I’ve also started experiencing elevated blood pressure, which I believe is related to the lack of sleep.

1q6izt0,My mind and body actively fight sleep and I'm going insane,"I'm 39 years old. For as long as I can remember, sleep has never come easily. If I wasn't totally physically exhausted, I'd be awake for a long time after going to bed if I tried sleeping before midnight, no matter how busy I'd been that day. 

Getting older and having a kid have changed this a little. Now I'm asleep at 11:30. Unfortunately, since this past summer, I am awake nearly every night around 2:00. I used to be able to go back to sleep after getting up around that time to pee, now that's become difficult or impossible. 

The constant factor is that if I have any energy at all, I am thinking about something. What I did that day, what I have to do tomorrow. A song lyric. Something I read recently. A noise in the distance. But it never stops. My wife says she just closes her eyes, turns off her brain, and sleeps. I have no idea what that feels like but she can sleep anytime, anywhere, for any length of time. I am so jealous. 

And if I have any energy at all, I can feel my brain trying to keep me awake. I'll be drifting off, realize it, and feel my brain pull me out of it to keep thinking about stuff. Trying to stop this is like trying not to think about elephants. 

I'm a few weeks into CBT. The therapist has me getting up to read in a different room (without looking at a clock) if I find myself unable to get back to sleep, so as to re-associate being in bed with being asleep. We've had mixed results so far and I'm trying to keep an open mind but it's hard not to get frustrated. I'm also worried about the effects on my health, which also keeps me up at night!

- permission to fail at sleeping

- actual breathing room/space to fail (reducing penalties for failure ie. deloading academically)

I thought about this for a while and realized that my insomnia from failure to sleep came about because of extensive strictness and rigidity from my mom as a child and early adolescence. Like I would get plagued by anger, dissatisfaction, judgments or abandonment if I failed to (in her words) 'just be absolutely still and sleep it's so easy what is wrong with you?'

Also, hard rigidity on never being able to deload at academics.

Not sure how neurotypicals get over these kinds of things! They must be gifted with some exceptional genetics that we sadly lack. Feels like rocket science/unreachable taska to just be able to make choices that allow myself to breathe and not choose suffering.

1q6fvsn,Adaptogens and Supplements saved me from insomnia,"Hi everybody! 

I wanted to share with you what really helped me from the insomnia. First i will give you context about me, I'm 26M and started with insomnia when i was around 23 or 24. I'm an overthinker and anxious person and also went through a very difficult time in my life during 2023 and 2024. There were days when i slept only 1 hour or 2, or even nothing, it was the worst and it was driving me crazy. Also i couldn't get asleep due to a lot of noise in my head, like a lot of it. And if i wanted to sleep in another house it was even worst, i just couldn't. 

At this point i've tried melatonin, clonazepam and alprazolam, and i was just needing more of those drugs and it was not even that helpful, it was like cover then the sun with a finger, that's it. Also i found that i was very very low in vitamin D, so that was also another issue. 

Then my mom sent me a podcast (in spanish) about adaptogens and how they are very helpful with stress, high cortisol, anxiety, insomnia and many many things. That podcast was just everything for me and i was like, okay i'm going to invest in adaptogens and have faith that this will help me because i've done at this point many things without success. So i did that, i bought different adaptogens and it was a miracle. I've been with them almost 3 months and it has been the best thing i've done for me, now i sleep every day around 7 to 8 or even 9 hours, and now i'm a heavy sleeper, i rest very very well. Of course i also take care of my sleeping quality, i have a routine that gets me in a ""zen mode"" or ""relax mode"" before getting in bed, and even though my friends tell me i over react, i don't care, like i really take care of my sleeping quality and go to bed at 9pm and every day always at the same time. 

Now, once you know pretty much my story, this is the list of adaptogens that helped me:

* **Ashwagandha:** Stress and anxiety reduction, improves sleep quality and cognitive support. I take it at night. 
* **Reishi:** Immune system support, stress relief and sleep improvement, anti-inflammatory effects. I take it at night.
* **L-Theanine (This one is like magic):** Quiets the mind (literally), sleep support an improves focus and attention.
* **Magnesium:** I take a magnesium complex but i know that magnesium glycinate is the best when it comes to sleep well, and i want to add it in my supplement stack. 

Another supplements and adaptogens i take:

* **Vitamin D**
* **Probiotics and Prebiotics**
* **Rhodiola (this one is strong, it gives you energy and i use it very occasionally)**
* **Siberian Eleuthero**

Just to let you know, then you're with adaptogens have in mind that these work slowly, so you need to be patient, very very patient. ",1767793880.0,3,4,insomnia,sleep

It kept getting worse and I was finally prescribed Hydroxyzine. It didn’t help.. I ended up on a mixture of an anti anxiety tablet and 7,5mg zopicline. It worked well for a while until I didn’t and I ended up in urgent care (did not help at all).. After that my psychiatrist prescribed me additional alimezamine 5mg up to 4 tablets. Finally I could sleep. I had developed severe sleep related anxiety by then. So he tried putting me on mirtazapine but I reacted very bad. Progressively I could go back to only using Zopiclone. However I just got prescribed zoloft for baseline anxiety and it has destroyed my sleep. Yesterday was my first night in it and my meds failed me 4h in. Tonight I went back on an additional 2 tablets of alimezamine which would make me sleep a long long time usually but no.. it’s 5 I’ve been up since 3 and am agonizing. Should I stop the setraline ? Any advice at all ? I feel so hopeless. I wonder If going on sleeping meds was not the worst idea of all. I can’t even nap without them. ",1767758858.0,0,6,insomnia,sleep
1q64teb,Do you ever wake up after only a few minutes of sleep and then can't go back to sleep the rest of the night?,"I deleted my former post asking the same thing because I'm apparently so tired, I couldn't even communicate clearly. I think I've explained it better here.

I've struggled with insomnia all my life but lately have seen improvement after trying several supplements. I've gone from sleeping 3-5 hours per night to 5-7 hours per night. However, my mind/body has thrown a new wrench into the works.

Lately, every one or two weeks, I'll go to bed at about my usual time, fall asleep, and then wake up after only 20-30 minutes. Then I can't go back to sleep the rest of the night.

It's really frustrating. It basically makes it impossible to function the next day and I just don't feel good for several more days after that.

I don't know what happened, or why it has, but it's geniuenly driving me insane since I have this continuous insomnia that hasn't stopped since last summer.

1q6079d,How do you stop overthinking sleep when it used to be effortless?,"I’m realizing my issue with sleep isn’t that I can’t sleep, it’s that I’ve started overthinking it, and I’m curious how others broke out of that loop.
For most of my life, sleep was passive. I’d even procrastinate it, especially on school or work nights, because I didn’t want to “fast-forward” to the next day. I slept fine even during stressful periods.

Things shifted after a stretch of night shifts / schedule changes (days → nights → stuck on nights). Since then, sleep feels like something I have to manage instead of something that just happens. And I was going through some nights where I had little to no sleep which triggered some fears of not sleeping or getting enough sleep. ( my true fear is 0 hrs of sleep)

Now I catch myself worrying about sleep way too 
early in the evening, monitoring whether I’ll fall asleep, and thinking about how bad the next day will be if I don’t.

I use CBD sometimes and hydroxyzine (PRN) on tougher nights. They help, but I’ve noticed that even when meds work, my brain is still “watching” my body, waiting to feel sleepy. That monitoring seems to keep me more alert instead of relaxed.
What’s frustrating is that objectively:

I still sleep most nights

I’ve slept my whole life without issues

I know this feels very similar to OCD/anxiety 
rumination patterns I’ve had before.

But the meaning of sleep has changed. It went from “whatever” to “this needs to happen or tomorrow is ruined,” and that pressure seems to be the problem. For anyone who’s been through something similar:

How did you stop mentally supervising sleep?

How did you get back to a more passive relationship with it?

Did schedule disruptions trigger this for you too?
I’m especially interested in mindset shifts or behavioral changes that helped — not just “sleep hygiene” stuff.

1q5zkfh,Urgent help needed,"I have reached a breaking point and feel I have nowhere to turn. For background context, I am up to 6 different psychiatric diagnoses. One of them being PTSD from my severely abusive upbringing. Despite of all this, I never had a substance use problem and have been pretty high functioning. I've tried 5 different antidepressants, and currently on Zoloft. I have been on it long before the insomnia became unmanageable, so I don't imagine it's the culprit. None of the meds even seem to do much of anything. I have been having a hard time with insomnia (pretty much only falling asleep) since about 13 (I am now 30), though it occurred only intermittently with no impact on my functioning... until 2 1/2 years ago. 

At first, I had attributed it to stress from a long term relationship. It ended one year ago, and the insomnia has since gotten 3x worse. Of course, the sleep deprivation turned into this vicious cycle of having diminished capability to handle overall stress/responsibilities, including even basic function, and watching everything turn impossibly shittier would then exacerbates the mental health conditions. 6 months ago, I had to change to a very part-time basis job mainly due to the insomnia.

From extensive research, I have found absolutely zero helpful information for what I'm experiencing. It is as if none of these medical professionals knows how insomnia can be like. 

It is not a matter of implementing more relaxation techniques. It is not from experiencing racing thoughts or any forms of physiological symptoms that anxiety manifests in. What is happening is that I very much physically feel like I need to go to sleep, but then I would be trapped in the narrow window right before you actually lose consciousness in full sleep. I would experience the involuntary muscle twitching/sensation of falling that is accompanied right before getting to sleep, and just not get there. The normal behavioral advice for insomnia about getting up to do something until one feels tired enough doesn’t apply since that would actually require you to feel awake, which is not the case. I’m not awake in the way that if someone starts talking to me, I would be able to even register it. When this first started two and half years ago, I could still get to sleep eventually. In recent months, it would last the whole night, frequently for multiple days in a row. The same thing happens when I try to nap. I have been getting maybe 2 full nights of rest out of the whole week. 

I have put a decent amount of effort into everything. Keeping a meticulous schedule, avoiding certain foods, exercise, yoga, meditation, binaural sounds, acupuncture...I have been using every supplement under the sun for relaxation/sleep. I have tried several prescription sleep medications. It would help for about one week then lose their efficacy. I considered trying a sleep study, but was told by 3 people that it's completely useless. 

I feel severely suicidal. I have not been able to divert my attention from fixating on it. The thoughts/images intrude whatever task I'm attempting to focus on. I know that if I could just rest properly, everything would return to being manageable again. 

Anyone that knows what I'm describing here, please, please, please share your experience and what you have found to help or didn't help.

1q5y5em,Early obligations are one of the worst things for my insomnia,I foolishly made a dental appointment for 10am because it would be on the way to work.

1q5jxa0,Why does nothing seem to be helping me fall asleep?,"So I've been dealing with insomnia for a couple months now. It started mostly in the Fall and has gotten progressively worse over time. I do have the rare good night. But still averaging about 3-4 hours a night tops. I have tried Zopiclone, Lemborexant. Yesterday I went to the ER out of desperation. I was a zombie. The MD prescribed me Oxazepam 15-30mg. Last night I took it at 9:10pm. I felt the exact same at 10:20pm. I did manage to fall asleep probably around 11:15 is my guess. I think that was mostly just from extreme sleep deprivation and not the benzo. Why am I feel like zero effect of these medications? I just feel tired the next day and it feels like I haven't slept. I do everything that promotes sleep.

To give some context, I am a very healthy 29yr female. I exercise regularly. I don't smoke/drink/drugs. I moved to a new city last month. But I do not feel stressed. I have anxiety and PDD (persistent depressive disorder). I'm not on any medications. Why did it taking 15mg of Oxa have zero effect on me? What else can I do/take? I am desperate.

Things I have tried include: Magnesium, 3 separate hospital prescribed meds (I forgot the names, but all of them made me aggressive and stressed), less stress, no school, no human interaction, full isolation of any possible triggers, sleeping with a nightlight, sleeping with no light at all, sleeping with a partner, sleeping with plushies, going to bed at 8pm without being woken up at all and waking whenever I felt like it for multiple months, which ended in waking up between 1pm and 8pm, and nothing has worked.

I have this happen every once in a while, since I was 19. Thankfully, besides that first episode, it lasts for a night and then I’m fine. Unfortunately I do use weed to help with my sleep and have been fully dependent on it every night for the past 5 years. 

It is for sure due to anxiety. My heart beats all night right out of my chest. I get so anxious about not sleeping that I dont. The standard stuff I think we have all experienced. 

I just feel like this episode is going to be similar or worse to my first episode in 2019. During that time I was a full time student and working a part time job. I started failing a class which had never happened to me before which added to the stress.  

The really scary part was I had also moved to a new place and started having weird occurrences. A few weeks before this initially started, I would be on the verge of sleeping and then hear someone screaming my name. It was so vivid I would wake up and call to my parents who I swore I just heard but I live alone now so? The insomnia then started up and I also started getting really paranoid, about hearing that voice again or that someone was watching me through my windows or was hiding in my closet. I was convinced that someone was deliberately trying to keep me up. There was one night I truly thought I was going to die due this person either due to him hiding in my closet or me putting a bullet through my skull. I know now I was just really tired and looking for any reason to blame the insomnia on.

So here I am laying in bed and scared shitless as i haven’t had more than one bad night of sleep back to back in nearly years. I know my anxiety is going to be worse than usual because I’m building it up in my head. I also have had a fucked sleep schedule since new years and staying up too late to party the past week and sleeping in too late. Also got a new cat. Also weed isn’t working rn either. I was huffing my pen all night and I don’t even feel high just weird and paranoid again. For a second I thought my closet door was opening by itself. Then I thought I was hearing whispering from my patio but I think it was just my fan.

held my breath... counted... felt stupid.

maybe its not me doing it wrong.
maybe breathing is supposed to come later.

you cant just jam it into neutral. the whole thing grinds and stays revved.

the technique works fine for some people.
just not when youre using it 6 steps too early.

idk.
feels like all the advice works if youre already kinda calm.
but what if you never learned how to drop even one gear.

1q58c1d,Spontaneous Insomnia is making me afraid,"
Hi everyone,

I’m posting here because I’m really confused and worried about what’s been happening to my sleep over the last few days, and I’m looking for advice or similar experiences.

Background (english is not my primary language sorry )

I’m 25 years old, male.

I’ve always had very good sleep hygiene and usually slept 8–9 hours without issues.

No history of fatal insomnia or similar neurological diseases in my family.

I don’t take daily medication (I have ADHD but no treatment for a long time).

I was not stressed before all this started.

Everything began very suddenly.

---

Timeline of my recent nights

Night 1 – Spontaneous all-nighter
I went to bed like usual, no stress, no anxiety, no external trigger. I simply could not fall asleep at all. Zero sleep. This had never happened to me before.

Night 2 – About 5 hours, very fragmented
After New Year’s Eve (some alcohol but not drunk), I finally slept around 5 hours total, but I was waking up almost every hour. I could fall back asleep fairly quickly, but sleep felt very light.

Night 3 – Around 1 hour
Went to bed earlier, took melatonin. I think I slept about 1 hour, then woke up suddenly with my heart racing. After that, I couldn’t fall back asleep.

Night 4 – Again around 1 hour
Same pattern(except i took 2 drop of lysanxia 15mg/ml). Brief sleep of 1 hour, sudden awakening, strong alert feeling, no way to maintain sleep.

Night 5 – Very short fragmented blocks
That night I had several short sleep blocks (20–30 minutes, then another 20–30 minutes, then about 1 hour). Every time I drifted off, I’d wake up again.

Night 6 – Long night but extremely fragmented
I finally slept around 9 hours total, but I woke up every single hour. I could fall back asleep, but I never stayed asleep for long. I woke up feeling unrefreshed.

Night 7 – Back to short sleep
That night I slept in fragments again: a short period early in the night, then another short one, then about 1 hour in the early morning.

According to my Apple Watch this night :

Sleep is highly fragmented

REM sleep was about 1h40

Respiratory rate was higher than usual yet my heartbeat is nearly good tho i feel my heart pound like crazy...



---

What I notice

I can fall asleep, but I can’t maintain sleep.

I often wake up suddenly with a strong sense of alertness or heart pounding.

During the day, I feel strangely “awake” but mentally foggy and forgetful.

The anxiety mostly came after the sleep problems started, not before.



---

What I’ve tried

Melatonin → helps me get sleepy, but I still wake up after ~1 hour.

Metarelax → 4 pills a day

Sleepyl → before ""sleeping""

Sedistress plus → before ""sleeping'

Lysanxia (2 drop once) → mild calming effect, but didn’t fix the awakenings.

I’ve avoided heavy caffeine and screens late.



---

My questions

Has anyone experienced sudden, severe insomnia like this without prior stress or by the fact of being old ?

Can insomnia really start this abruptly at my age?

Does this sound like acute insomnia with hyperarousal, or something else?

Could the elevated nighttime respiratory rate be linked to frequent awakenings?

What helped you break this cycle?

1q53nu4,Lunesta anxiety,"Hi folks. So I have OCD, and am terrified of not being able to remember things. It’s one of the worst triggers for my OCD and my mind fills in the blanks with scary things I know aren’t true. I also have severe insomnia. I was prescribed Lunesta, and surprisingly I’m not worried about taking it when I’m alone, mostly because my intrusive thoughts tend to revolve around being terrified of putting someone else in danger, not myself. So, I only take it when I’m completely alone in the house. 

My question is this: is Lunesta safe to take when another person is in the house? I ask because my partner is moving in soon, which I am so, so excited for, but it also means I will rarely be home alone, and I’m worried about what to do when my insomnia is really severe and we’re living together. I am terrified I’ll put them at risk due to complex sleep behaviors/parasomnias (which haven’t happened yet to my knowledge), ie. turning on the stove in my sleep, other things that would pose a risk to another person if they didn’t notice/wake up to it.

1q526vp,What finally helped my “wake up after 5–6 hours and can’t fall back asleep” insomnia,"For years I’d fall asleep fine, then wake up after ~5–6 hours and be wide awake. I used Ambien, then Xanax, mainly to get back to sleep. They worked, but the side effects eventually outweighed the benefit.

What’s helped more than anything now is not fighting the wake-up.

When I wake, I put on an audiobook from Cloud Library (free through the library), usually classic novels like War and Peace — long, calm, zero suspense.

My rule is: either I enjoy listening, or I fall back asleep. Both are wins. That mindset alone reduced a lot of anxiety.

A couple other small things that help:
Very low-dose melatonin spray

A teaspoon of honey before bed (seems to help with early wakeups)

I’m not cured, but I sleep more (avg oura is 75), and when I do wake up, it no longer feels like a crisis.

I did two sleep studies, and even on medication (dayvigo), I woke up 20-30x within 6 hours. They are usually for like a split second and then I fall back asleep - I don’t even remember most of them. I may remember like 5 at most, usually the longest ones. Because it’s so fast, the sleep specialist is convinced this is not sleep hygiene related. 

I am guessing it’s likely something medical. I do have sleep apnea and my second study was done with a CPAP. My average AHI is 0.3 per night with the device so I’ve ruled that out as a cause. It may be something brain related? My study did show slightly high alpha activity while asleep. I have high iron levels but I tested negative for hemacromatosis.

You think, damn. I could have done something else in this two hours. But no matter. You’ll fall asleep soon.

You count the hours. Only 6 hours before you have to wake up. You start to get annoyed.

You feel like you would feel better if you sleep on your right side. So you turn.

Then you start. You close your eyes. You’re tired but the lids are resisting. You force them to close, convince yourself that you are sleepy.

You start to think…. Normally I slip into sleep while thinking. I let my thoughts flow without restrictions, detached from reality. Soon it became a dream. I sometimes would notice “Ah, it’s a dream!” before I pass out.

So you let your thoughts flow…. You let the images flash while trying not to think. But it feels wrong. The images are too real, too logical, too coherent…. Soon you realize that you aren’t slipping into the Dream World, but other worlds- Worry World? What-if World? If-Only World?

You think, damn. Let’s think of a pink hippopotamus, playing a piano.

The image promptly vanishes. Replaced by a voice that told you, this is no use. You won’t sleep. This isn’t working.

You are panicking, and estimate that it has been 30 minutes. Only 5.5 hours left. You want to know. But the moment you stare on your phone the light will jolt you awake again. So you think, F*** it. I’ll just get a nap tomorrow.

You think of a pink hippo again, playing a piano.

The pessimistic voice got joined by another voice. Hippopotamus is a revered and yet hated animal by the Egyptians, representing Osiris’ brother Seth… Hippopotamus hunting was a prevalent sport-

You wanted to cry. I JUST WANT TO FUCKING SLEEP!

Eventually you slept. You know it has been more than 4 hours since you first hit the bed. You know you’ll only sleep for three hours before the sunlight breaks in and the alarm forces you to wake.

Sometimes the sleep isn’t that good. You wake and think OMG I AM NOT ABLE TO SLEEP!! And see the clock and it’s only 5 AM. And you’re unable to continue sleeping until it’s time to take a shower.

Sometimes you manage to sleep, but you only knew you slept because time passed quite quickly. But you don’t feel refreshed at all.

My circadian rythm was killed when I started doing night shifts at the hospital. Once in a while I’d do a 12 hour shift at the weekends and go home so tired and sleep right away, and it would be reset again and I’ll sleep like people should do, if only for a few days. It sucks.

1q4s1qm,Insomnia started 5 months PP,"Hi all I joined Reddit just to see if community here can help. 
I had a baby Feb 2025. I started having a few sleepless nights where I’d be up for the day after a 2am feed or something so I’d get a half night of sleep. This was happening here and there around 5 months post partum. Then it slowly crept to not being able to fall asleep, or stay asleep and was happening more and more until about 9 months PP and it was so chronic it was every single night. Here we are now 11months pp and I am just mentally so done. I go days without sleeping, and then will have 1-2 “crash nights” a week where il finally sleep 3-4 hours. I feel like I’ve explored every option and been to so many doctors with no resolution. I am also breastfeeding so am limited as to meds I can take but also hate meds because I can barely function next day. 

Here’s what I’ve tried/explored:

-Every sleep supplement 
- A lot of sleep medications/aids (Dramamine, meclizine, trazadone) - they may work for a day or two and not work again and also make me feel horrible next day 
- Lorazepam 
- Bioidentical Progesterone 
- I’ve had full panel of bloodwork done every month since June. The only thing that comes up is that I have a high thyroidglobin antibody, but my thyroid levels are all in normal range so I’m told it is not the thyroid causing this
- hormones on my bloodwork are within normal range 

-looked into histamine intolerance because my histamine levels were high via blood around 5 months pp but they seemed to have leveled out so idk if that’s the problem anymore 

-tried various supplements like GABA, taurine, glycine, 5HTP, St. John’s wort.. trying to work on the neurotransmitters naturally 

I’ve been to numerous doctors. All want to say I have PPA / PPD and prescribe me Zoloft but I am trying to figure out the CAUSE. 

I basically lay there for hours and never fall asleep. I am so tired and resting… but cannot fall into a state of sleep. It’s bizzare and that’s why I am really pushing for this not just being anxiety. My husband sleeps in the other room with the baby monitor and I sleep in dark with face mask and ear plugs. 

This is all so weird because when she was a newborn I could pass out nursing her, and I was so sleepy I even took naps. Now I am more sleep deprived than ever in my life and I physically cannot sleep.

I feel a lot more groggy and disoriented in the mornings than before, and some nights I have woken up more than once.

Last prescription was for seven in October, which I used sparingly.

Some nights, I don't sleep at all, or get by on only a few hours. Currently I've been awake for most of the night and can't sleep. The other night, I was  awake for over 24 hours before I eventually fell asleep.

What are people's experiences with Zopiclone and do they find it any good? My experience is that it can work quite well if you're in the right frame of mind.

I'm also currently taking 1.5mg Risperidone and 15mg Mirtazapine. I was taking 30mg Mirtazapine, but wanted to reduce the dose with the aim of coming off, so did that about two weeks ago. The reduction of Mirtazapine could possibly explain the insomnia.

1q484lb,Insomnia is destroying me and my life. Need suggestions,"I've had insomnia since I was 10, I'm nearly 27. For the past 6 years I was on antipsychotic medication (Seroquel) which I've now been off for 8 weeks, because it honestly made me miserable and was given to me off label. Even on a very high dose I mostly got 4-5 hours of sleep and a very rare 6-8 hour night. It wasnt enough for me to function with such little sleep and a med that basically tranquilizes you that you need to sleep off.

In these past 8 weeks I have had not one night of full sleep, not one. And worse than that, I am having nights were I don't sleep for up to 4 days, like 0 hours in that time. Most nights I don't sleep at all and then get a small 2-3 hour nap at around 10am the next day. Just to be clear, I do not have any mental health disorder that gives me mania, which is what many would assume from my sleep patterns. 

I have tried several things from herbal remedies like magnesium, lemon balm, sleepy teas, valerian root. To actual sleeping pills like daroderaxent, Melatonin and zopiclone (in the UK so my options are limited as I'm doing this privately, not on the NHS). My sleep hygiene is excellent and I eat well. 

Im losing my mind from the lack of sleep, as I've said above this has been a serious issue for me since childhood (traumatic and abusive situation), but I am now an adult trying to run my own business. My entire livelihood and future relies on my ability to perform and work. I feel as if I can't think or focus because I am shakey, delirious mess right now. 

I have one more option which would be to try Ambien, only for a short amount of time. 

I would love to hear ANYTHING that has worked for you, no matter how crazy. I'm willing to try anything. As I said above I'm in the UK so I am limited when it comes to prescription drugs, anything I can get privately is also limited. Mostly looking for long term solutions as I don't want to get addicted to anything.

How to Stop Worrying and Start Living by Dale Carnegie.

I originally picked it up for general anxiety, but I was surprised by how much it helped my sleep. Several chapters talk about people who struggled with insomnia and eventually learned how to sleep again. Reading those stories alone was reassuring.

There’s one chapter in particular called “How to Stop Worrying About Insomnia” that completely changed the way I think about sleep. Instead of fighting insomnia or fearing it, the book helped me relax my mindset around it, and that made a huge difference. Over time, I was able to sleep again.

1q44gj1,Chronic sleep maintenance insomnia looking for guidance on meds and alternatives,"Hi everyone, I’m a 25-year-old male dealing with ongoing insomnia, primarily difficulty staying asleep, and I’m looking for guidance or shared experiences. Insomnia runs in my family, especially issues with sleep maintenance rather than sleep onset. I’m currently taking 25 mg sertraline, which I may switch to Lexapro soon with my psychiatrist. My main issue is that I fall asleep but wake up repeatedly or too early and can’t get back to sleep. This isn’t driven by anxiety right now—I just cannot stay asleep.

For context, mirtazapine 15 mg used to help but no longer works, so I’m exploring other options. I’m currently considering trazodone or low-dose doxepin as short-term options, and possibly Dayvigo, ramelteon, or something more natural like CBN. I already take melatonin (both immediate-release and extended-release) and magnesium, but they don’t seem to be enough anymore. I’ve attached my Oura sleep data from the past two nights, which shows fragmented sleep and poor continuity.

I also want to be clear that I’m trying to avoid benzodiazepines and Z-drugs (like Ambien or Lunesta). Lifestyle-wise, I’ve made significant changes: I used to smoke weed but gave it up, I no longer drink alcohol, and I barely consume caffeine at all—mostly just water. Despite this, my sleep quality hasn’t improved. I’m really just trying to get my sleep back on track and would appreciate any insight into medication choices, supplements, behavioral strategies, or alternatives that have helped others with similar sleep maintenance insomnia.

By day 3 without sleep, I literally passed out at 10 AM.","**You know that thing where you're absolutely exhausted, completely wiped out... and the second your head hits the pillow your brain decides it's time to replay every conversation from the last 3 years?**

I don't even know when this started anymore. I just know I'm so tired of being tired.

Last night I was lying there at 3:14 AM (why is it ALWAYS around 3 AM?), wide awake, thinking about a work email I sent last Tuesday. My body felt like a rock but my mind was running a marathon. I could literally feel my heartbeat and hear every single sound in the house.

The worst part? Everyone keeps telling me to ""just relax"" or ""try meditation."" Like... thanks, I'll just tell my brain to calm down. That definitely works. I've tried the dark room, the cool temperature, no screens before bed—I KNOW all the sleep hygiene stuff. It doesn't touch this.

My doctor even said ""just wake up earlier—you'll fall asleep naturally."" So I tried it. By day 3 without sleep, I literally passed out at 10 AM. Still didn't fix anything.

During the day I'm exhausted and can barely function. Brain fog, irritable with everyone, apologizing to people for being grouchy. But then nighttime comes and suddenly my brain is like ""actually, let's be wide awake and think about literally everything.""

I used to think I was the only one going through this. Now I'm starting to wonder if everyone's just pretending they sleep fine.

1q41kse,Finally switched my meds!,"After 13 years of varying insomnia and about 5 years of extremely resistant insomnia and averaging 2-3 hrs on good nights; my psychiatrist switched me from trazadone/temazepam to trazadone/xanax 2mg.

Its been killing me to take 150-300mg trazadone and 2 restoril to still be awake 7 hrs later and take a 3rd round of both to sleep for 2 hrs amd wake up feeling hungover.  The temazepam only made me maybe 20% more lkkely to sleep regardless of dose but when I calculated the ewuivalent Xanax dose I was needing like 3-3.5+ mg worth and still sleeping unreliable. 

I never specify or request spec8fic meds but ill voice past experience/rx amd what worked but he wasnt responding to me explaining that taking double of both meds still wont help me sleep reliably. Thats usually enough but 4+ months of sinilar complaints and instances feugue states and 72hrs no sleep and we went from 100 to 150mg trazadone.

I finally reminded him of my past anxiety & insomnia meds and that instead of taking more of something ineffective id rather take a normal dose of something that works at least semi regularly.  Not sleeping on 150-300mg+trazadone and 45-67.5mg restoril is was less logical than 100-150mg trazadone and 2mg xanax.  Going to get the rx soon but given Ive slept 4 hrs max out of 88 hrs and counting; I may try to take 1/2 and try to get a nap before dinner or just suck it up and try to sleep for as long as possible. 

At this point I usually either pass out 4-6 hrs or go into a feuge state and get no sleep so im not trying to black out (without the benzos not from them) cause I wanted to wait an extra 3-4 hrs to sleep. 

 Scheduling/speaking to the dr has become like a 30 attempt 10 day issue but him and my pain mgmt doc are willing to rx with each dr awaee of the all rx abd thats super difficult to find but the constant missed call back times and appts and calling for days to keep being told ""ill call you later/tomorrow"" has had me feeling anxious on top of my exhaustion/insomnia calling him daily trying to get some form of communication.  

At least he's willing to try these meds despite not being open to the orexin agonists but xanax 1.5mg usually helps me sleep 60% of the time so 2mg should def help me fall asleep at least somewhat like a regular person. 

Edit:  IT WORKED!  I was approaching 96hrs on 4 hrs sleep total and decided a nap would be justified for the first dose of my new sleep meds...no melatonin or trazadone and I even forgot to smoke ...fell asleep for 6 hrs(longer than my good nights) and woke up just now.  

So 150- 300mg traz + 22.5-67.5 temazeoan, 300-400mg melatonin viaglycinate and 40-80mg melatonin - were less effective than a single 2 mg xanax...im so grateful for the swap even though contacting him monthly feels like Im a crackhead calling their dealer 30 times but thsts me trying to contact over 7-10 days and being told hed call baxk but didnt...regardless he actually ie treating me now with something that actually works for me.",1767560586.0,1,2,insomnia,sleep

1q3vdlp,A step toward reducing fear of tapering off anything,"Thinking about tapering this year? Scared?

Once people realise that fear is part of the problem, they want to squash that fear immediately. So they reach for something - medication, meditation, whatever their go-to is - to escape the discomfort.

And it seems to 'work'...

Your brain absolutely loves that relief. You go from miserable or terrified to doing the thing (or white knuckling it before caving in) to no longer being afraid. (And voila, you probably sleep)

That relief creates a dopamine hit, and your brain files that away as a ""do this again!"" 

The brain does this as a part of learning via experience. If you were a hungry hunter/gatherer who came across a massive blueberry bush, your brain would file away everything that happened before.  It would help you remember the leaves and how they looked over near the bush (as opposed to where you didn't find berries), the turn in a path, how you walked that path...all the things you looked for that led you closer to the berry stash would be filed away as a 'pre-berry finding experience'. This way, you'd be more likely to find berries again.

With other kinds of behaviours in modern life, your brain literally recreates the discomfort (much like the hunger of the hunter-gatherer) -  so you'll do the thing that brings relief (find the berries!) 

You end up trapped in a cycle where your brain has learned to manufacture the very problem you're trying to escape.  You act to escape.  This reinforces the cycle.  

The good news is that, on the mental side of tapering, you can start breaking this cycle even before you and your doctor embark on a (gasp) change in your dose.

Here's how:

Feel that clock creeping toward ""pill time""? Usually take it right away? Or you suck it up until you can't cope with the anxiety? Try this instead:

**First time:** Go into the bathroom. Just notice your anxiousness with curiosity. Wait for it to shift - because it will. Then leave.

**Next time:** Open the cabinet. Feel what's actually happening inside. It will settle if you let it. Close the cabinet. Leave.

**Next time:** Take the pill out. Don't take it yet. Explore what's going on. Let it settle without reacting. Then leave.

**Next time:** Fill the water glass and set it down. Wait. What's happening? Then leave.

When you eventually take it (as your doctor has prescribed), you're no longer reacting to and reinforcing the fear. 

You shift from ""I'm in agony, I HAVE to""  to ""I am m teaching myself it's safe not immediately react to this discomfort"".....to.... ""I'm making a choice.""

You are putting yourself back in the driver's seat.

And when you do begin tapering, you'll be in a much stronger, more confident position to handle the mental side of your journey.

I still manage to get sleep (thank God)
It's usually a good amount but I only have it when my body gets so tired it that it gives up on staying awake. (Usually mid-day)
When I close my eyes and try to sleep my heart slowly begins beating louder and louder until I feel proper palpitations...
Then panic ensues...and then I feel like if I keep trying I will have a heart attack.
I open my eyes and everything stops, I'm fine again.

I took klonipon from 16-30- anywhere between 1 mg and 25 mgs a night. ( I was also abusing “ uppers” durning that time so sleep was really hard to come by sometimes.)

1q2szik,25 years of insomnia — gone after “biofilm” washout + NAC/Berberine (1-year update),"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share an experience because I spent years reading posts like this and honestly believed my sleep was just “broken” forever.

I’ve had lifelong insomnia (about 25 years). Not just trouble falling asleep, but that constant feeling of never getting properly tired, light sleep, waking up a lot, and feeling wired at night or not sleeping at all.

Then something happened that completely surprised me:

1. Triple antibiotic therapy → I finally felt “normal tired”

I had to do a triple antibiotic therapy for a separate issue. And for the first time in years, I felt naturally tired. I slept through the night like a baby and woke up feeling… normal.

That lasted about 4 weeks, and then the insomnia came back — almost like my microbiome drifted back to its old baseline.

That was my “wait a second” moment:

Maybe my sleep issues are connected to my gut more than I ever realized.

2) Doctor visit focused on IBS + biofilm → “biofilm washout”

After that I saw a doctor who was researching IBS and biofilm approaches. (This paper gives some context on the biofilm topic: [ https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8527885/ ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8527885/) )

He did a biofilm washout (not DIY, not advice — just what was done in my case, medically supervised).

3) After that: NAC + Berberine → no sleep issues for 1 year

After the washout I started taking:

•	NAC

•	Berberine / other antimicrobials

And since then: no more sleep issues.

Not “slightly improved” — genuinely normal sleep, normal tiredness, sleeping through the night. It’s been 1 year now.

From time to time I also eat L. reuteri yogurt (not daily, just occasionally).

Anyone with similar experiences?

Anyway, I am healed from insomnia . Maybe my experience helps someone .

TL;DR: Sleep issues for \~25 years. Triple antibiotics briefly “fixed” it for \~4 weeks. Then a doctor-supervised biofilm washout + NAC/Berberine afterward → insomnia gone for 1 year.",1767441779.0,195,74,insomnia,sleep

1q2on62,Haven't gotten any deep sleep in a whole year,"Hello everybody! 

I (26F) have huge troubles sleeping. My sleep quality started decreasing about 10 years ago, when i was i  highschool. I was sharing my room with my very young sister, and our parents would leave early in the morning, so I learned to be very aware of what was happening around me in order to watch her and make sure she's safe even when i was asleep. That led to my roommate in uni being annoyed with me because I would be instantly woken up by the slightest noise in the whole apartment and not being able to fall back asleep, but it got better over time. 

The thing is, back when sharing the room with my sister I was getting good rest while being half-asleep basically, and then in uni I was easily woken up from my deep sleep, but I was getting deep sleep. 

For the past couple of years though, I started having huge difficulties falling asleep. I frequently toss and turn all night and can't fall asleep at all, despite being really tired. I am also aware of the passing of time and aware of every sound around me. If you start talking to me in the middle of the night when I'm asleep, I'll be able to have a full conversation on the spot, I don't need to be ""woken up"" and take a few minutes to become coherent. 

On top of that, I remember the last time I went to bed, fell asleep and just woke up in the morning fully rested and ready to stand up right away and start my day. No tossing and turning, no frequent waking up, no problem falling asleep, not aware of the passing of time, nothing. I was fully OUT, got deep sleep and so much rest. That happened one whole year ago. Since then, no deep sleep whatsoever. 

I'm starting to be very worried about this since it could impact my overall health, which I care a lot about. I work out, take vitamins, eat only meals I cook myself, I don't drink alcohol, no coffee either and don't smoke. I've tried taking melatonin gummies in the past but I just got headaches and nothing else.

1q2o2aq,possible neurological/nerve symptoms after trazodone,"it's been quite a while since i've talked about this, but due to some recent anxieties and a short stay in the hospital, i've been thinking about it again and i'm wondering if i'm the only one who's had this happen.

a couple of years ago, i had been on trazodone for sleep and it was working wonderfully, though it did knock me out for 12-14 hours a night. one night, out of the blue, after having taken the trazodone, i laid down to sleep and felt this intense jerk-like sensation through my spine. it lasted for a split second, but it came again and again and again every few seconds. it was impossible to sleep. i had no idea what caused it, and while most of those days are foggy now, i do remember experimenting a little to see whether or not it was the trazodone, and i did find that it was the trazodone that caused it.

now, i realized that a few months before, i had begun having RLS symptoms. i believe i was put on Ropinirole before the trazodone incident, but that helped immensely with my RLS and still does to this day.

i'm currently on 10mg Ambien and a few other medications that help me sleep very well for a proper amount of time (7-9 hours), but i came on here to ask if anyone else had experienced a similar issue to the trazodone like i have. the strange hypnic jerk-like symptoms that went through my spine every few seconds, the RLS popping up a few months before, or even any kind of insomnia or neurological symptoms caused by the trazodone. i feel like i'm the only one that's gone through this. if i'm not, then that'll help me feel a little better lol. i'm here for anyone who has gone through similar, however!",1767424071.0,1,2,insomnia,sleep

1q2juf2,Night job + day job = broken sleep (I keep waking up after 3 hours no matter what. Help!!!,"Post:

I’m working two jobs and my sleep is getting wrecked. I’m trying so hard to get a consistent 7 hours, but I keep waking up after ~3 hours and can’t stay asleep.

My jobs:
	•	Night job: 10:00 PM – 6:00 AM
	•	Days off: Sunday + Monday
	•	Day job: 9:00 AM – 3:00 PM
	•	Days off: Monday + Wednesday + Saturday + Sunday

So I’m switching between a night schedule and a day schedule depending on the day. Sunday and Monday are the only days I’m off from both jobs.

My sleep window (what I aim for):
I try to sleep right after my day job, usually 3:00 PM to 9:30 PM (sometimes 2:30 PM to 9:30 PM). That should be about 6.5–7 hours and it’s the most consistent window I can realistically stick to.

The problem:
Even when I follow that window, I wake up after ~3 hours like clockwork. I’m tired, I fall asleep, then I’m suddenly awake and can’t get back into real sleep. Sometimes I’ll doze, but it doesn’t feel restorative.

Why it’s frustrating:
I’m actually trying to be consistent — same window, same goal — but my body won’t stay asleep. And because my schedule is intense (day job + night job on some days), missing sleep hits hard.

Questions:
	•	Has anyone dealt with waking up after 2–3 hours consistently, especially with shift work?
	•	Any practical tips that actually helped you sleep through your whole window (light control, room temp, meal timing, caffeine timing, naps, etc.)?
	•	When does this become “talk to a doctor / sleep clinic” territory?",1767411250.0,1,2,insomnia,sleep
1q2hbsk,Insomnia taught me that trying harder is usually the wrong move,"I spent years fighting insomnia by trying to fix it. More routines, more techniques, more effort. The harder I tried, the worse it got.

The turning point was realizing that the effort itself was often part of the problem. Lying in bed anxiously monitoring whether a technique was working or not just kept my brain alert and frustrated.

What actually helped wasn’t chasing the perfect method, but learning when to stop intervening altogether. A few things that ended up making a real difference:

Getting out of bed if I wasn’t asleep after 20-30 minutes and doing something boring in low light (like reading a dull book or folding laundry) until I felt sleepy again.

Dropping all expectations about “good” sleep and accepting that some nights are just bad without turning them into a crisis.

Keeping interventions super short and low-pressure: a quick body scan without forcing relaxation, or just noticing my breath for a minute or two.

Occasionally using very light audio, nothing long or instructional. Sometimes a short rain sound, sometimes a brief guided thing that doesn’t demand focus.

I’ve tried a bunch of apps over the years. Calm and Insight Timer are still in my rotation for the occasional wind-down. Recently I’ve also checked out a few more interactive ones like Thinking Me that don’t push a scripted relaxation. They just let you check in with whatever you’re feeling in the moment, which feels less like “doing sleep hygiene” and more like acknowledging what’s actually going on.

So my question is, which one(s) are the best for long term usage? I've made a ranked list but I want your guys' input. I've already tried temazepam, clonazepam, and alprazolam which don't help or give side effects.

1. Quazepam

2. Estazolam

3. Diazepam

4. Flurazepam

5. Alprazolam ER (I get a midday dip when taking it the night before so the ER should mitigate that)

6. Triazolam

Each night  i get into bed around the same time, put my sleep mask on (don't necessarily feel sleepy but take a med to try and make me a little tired) and i must fall into some weird unconscious state as time goes fast but like i don't wake up how i used to. i cant explain it without sounding crazy but im just .. awake. no  signs of morning sleepiness, no feeling of me sleeping, eyes not heavy or tired. Just wired like i havnt slept at all. its literally as though i have just opened and closed my eyes and the day has continued but alot of time has past. i think this is paridoxial insomnia? but its NOT STOPPING. its every night non stop and i am living with it i guess but im still aware of how unsatisfying my life is and nights of no getting real sleep. i just miss actually sleeping so much, the feeling of good rest and tiredness. i assume im getting some light sort of sleep and just not entering deep sleep? its honestly been so long that i cant even remember what sleep feels like.

i take magnesium before bed, drink tea and do breathing exercises but nothing is working. i don't know if its the years worth of meds that have done something to my brain? i took ambien for almost a year then low dose quetiapine for about 2 months. i actually have not been able to sleep naturally since my insomnia like i said My brain physically doesn't sleep and i can go a week with no sleep and not even feel tired.

1q28iuu,Advice for severe insomnia with no root cause,"Apologies in advance for the long post:

Add the title suggests, I have been dealing with severe insomnia, yet I can't pin point what might be causing it. Most nights I get 1-3 hours of sleep. It has now come to a point where I don't sleep at all for a whole night. My brain won't shut off and is filled with endless, useless thoughts. My body feels tired, but as soon as I try to sleep, my brain becomes wired as if I've had 12 coffees. I'm getting frustrated and I don't know what to do.

For the record, I've always had issues with sleep ever since I was a baby. I'm a very light sleeper and sensitive to light. Have always struggled with sleeping in unfamiliar environments as well. I try to use sleep ear plugs and an eye mask which used to be effective, but now they don't really help anymore. I've aso tried listening to white noise but that doesn't seem to help.

I have seen multiple doctors regarding my sleep issues, all of which have failed to determine what thing or things may be contributing to my sleepless nights. I have seen a gynecologist who suspects I may have endometriosis (and ruled out PCOS). Ultrasound scans and hormone tests revealed nothing, so a lapscop surgery is my last resort to confirm whether I have it or not. The wait time for the surgery 12 months. I'm moving overseas within the next six, so surgery isn't on the cards atm. I have also had multiple blood and thyroid function tests, all of which have come back normal.

I've tried a few of the classic meds (e.g., magnesium, melatonin) and antipsychotics (Quetiapine). The meds either didn't improve my sleep or I just built up a tolerance to them instead. Quetiapine in particular was pretty rough. It complicated my already dodgy menstrual cycles and it felt like I had been hit with a tranquilizer shot the next morning after a quarter pill dose. My already horrendous brain fog was just amplified by it as well.

I have also gone down the diet route as I have digestion issues. I'm on a FODMAP diet which does help minimise the excessive bloating I used to experience. I am intolerant to both gluten and dairy, so I limit those too. Alcohol and caffeine trends to increase my heartrate dramatically, even after one weak drink. On the rare occasion I do go out, when I get home I end up lying in bed while it feels like my heart is working overtime causing my body to feel like it's pulsing. I don't really drink at all anymore because of this.

I'm starting to wonder if I have undiagnosed ADHD - it runs in my family. I also wonder if I have some form of autonomic issue. I have an ectopic heart beat and experience heart palpitations at rest. I have caught my heartrate at 140 bpm while sitting completely still before. I'm an active person, and used to gym frequently prior to my insomnia becoming worse. I've tried to exercise to tire myself out, but that doesn't seem to work anymore.

And to top it all off, I'm in the final months of my master's degree. I work in a lab and I find I'm making the smallest of mistakes which jeopardises whole experiments. It's not ideal (or safe for that matter) to be in that environment while sleep deprived. On days where I hardly sleep, I just stay at home. Not ideal for a struggling student 😅

So, I've come to Reddit as a last resort. What could be going on with me? Has anyone had any shared experiences? I'm sick of just hearing that it's all in my head. Any sleeping tricks would be greatly appreciated too (aside from the classics like ""try breathing techniques"", ""counting sheep"" etc - they don't work for me).

1q1rrc8,"Waking up fully alert after 2–3 hours of sleep for weeks – meds involved, not sure what to do next","Hi everyone,  
I’m looking for advice or shared experiences because I’m stuck in a frustrating sleep cycle.

# Background (what started this)

Around **mid-September**, I suddenly started having daily episodes of:

* Rapid heartbeat
* High blood pressure
* Giddiness, confusion, feeling “out of control”

I went to the ER. **All tests were normal.**

# Initial treatment

My doctor started me on:

* **Propranolol ER 20 mg (morning)**
* **Flupentixol 0.5 mg (morning)**
* **Clonazepam 0.5 mg (night)**

These episodes stopped completely. Over time, I only felt mild giddiness.

# Clonazepam taper

I took clonazepam for \~**45 days**:

* 0.5 mg for 2 weeks
* 0.25 mg for 2 weeks
* Then tapered off gradually

About **7 days after stopping**, I developed **insomnia**.

# First insomnia phase

Doctor prescribed **mirtazapine 7.5 mg** for **4 days**:

* It helped
* I stopped it
* I also stopped **flupentixol** a few days later

# Relapse

About **3 weeks after stopping everything**, sleep problems returned.  
For **4–5 days**, I slept only **2–3 hours per night**.

Things I tried:

* **Melatonin** → didn’t help
* **Trazodone 12.5 mg (1 night)** → made things worse

# Current situation (main problem)

For the **last 4 days**, I’ve been taking **mirtazapine 7.5 mg nightly**, but:

* I fall asleep fine
* **Wake up after 2–3 hours feeling fully awake**
* Can’t fall back asleep
* Any later sleep feels **very light**, almost like **lucid dreaming while awake**

The first 2–3 hours feel like **good sleep**, but after that it’s like a switch flips.

I had brief episodes of feeling on edge, giddiness and confusion twice, and once I took 0.125 mg clonazepam.

# How I feel

* I don’t feel too exhausted during the day, but worried about getting such less sleep everyday.
* I’m starting to think the **September episode may have been triggered by poor sleep in the first place**

# My questions

1. Has anyone experienced **waking up fully alert after 2–3 hours** like this?
2. Should I **give mirtazapine more time**, or does this mean it won’t work for me?
3. Is restarting **clonazepam** a bad idea in this situation?
4. Could this be **withdrawal / rebound insomnia** even weeks later?

The intent of the affirmations was to rid myself of negative beliefs and I planned on listening to them for 7 days. Anyways, I started those on November 4th. When listening to these affirmations, I would noticed that my nervous system or fight or flight system would rev up. After listening to the affirmations for like 2 days, I started having insomnia.

This continued until I dropped the affirmations for a few days then sleep returned. Then after listening to them again, the same symptoms would start, brain fog and nervous system sensitivity being heightend, which led to more insomnia. I would also have a crap ton of dreams during the night, which I think may have been my brain processing the affirmations, i don't know. I eventually completed the 7 days and then decided to listen to more affirmations on three different topics. Mainly well being and an improved mind. Started those around November 15th. I tried to listen to all three at least once per day. To combat the nervous system dysregulation, I started doing nervous system regulation exercises after each session and this seemed to be enough to get me to drift off for bed. 

It sounds silly but I was always trying to go to bed in the 10pm-2am window, because I believed the affirmations would work better during those windows because of certain hormone releases. lAnyway, I listened to these affirmations all the way up until December 21st. Not every day because a lot days I couldn't sleep, so I stopped them, then was able to sleep. But sleep was never restful, it always felt light, but it was at least happening.

I decided to quit these affirmations around December 21st because it didn't feel worth it anymore, I thought by doing so that sleep would return to normal, but I was very wrong. On December 22nd I remember waking up very wired, but I eventually felt better as the day progressed. But on the 23rd, that's where I got zero sleep. And ever since then, I get in bed, I lay there with my eyes closed, I'm not very conscious, so I don't feel time pass by, but eventually I'll open my eyes and my body will feel extremely wired, I'll have adrenaline and cortisol pumping through my body and I can just tell that i didn't sleep. There's been a few nights where I've had dreams and that is the only way I can gauge that I slept.

But even then, that will be for maybe an hour or two, if that. I don't know how much I slept since December 23rd, but I know it isn't much. I feel horrid, I feel like I've broken my brain somehow with the affirmations and like this will never end. It's been 9 days so far and I think I've had deep sleep maybe once or twice. I just don't understand how you can do all the right things. Get in bed, close your eyes, try to get comfortable then open your eyes and it's like sleep never happened.

My symptoms right now are cold hands and feet, extreme brain fog, fear, anxiety, no appetite, darkened vision and a sense of doom. I have no idea whats going on or if and when this will end. What would be your suggestion for me, what should I do at this point?
 Also, what do you think happened to me. Is this sleep state misperception, hyper arousal, my subconscious not turning off...what do you guys think it is? Thank you ",1767314295.0,2,2,insomnia,sleep

What still gets me is the day after.
Not just the tiredness — but how everything suddenly feels heavier to decide.
What to work on.
What to ignore.
What not to make worse.

I keep messing those days up by either pushing too hard or completely checking out.

the thing is; i was finally sleeping well. 4-6 hours a night every night. i didn’t question it, i relished it. finally able to sleep, there’s nothing i can think of that i was doing differently. and now im back in this hell of not being able to sleep, and dreading it. hoping it’s because it’s -15c every night recently and i’m too poor to have good heating. idk.

Dec 22-23 - horrible sleep, melatonin and Motrin PM only
Dec 24 - 5mg ambien, two hours sleep then up all night with panic
Dec 25 - 7.5 mg ambien, finally got some ok sleep
Dec 26 - 7.5 mg ambien bad sleep maybe four hours
Dec. 27 - 7.5mg ambien - bad sleep maybe two hours I think?
Dec. 28 - felt ambien wasn’t working like it usually does to reset my clock, 1mg Xanax slept ok
Dec 29 - .75 mg Xanax didn’t sleep amazing but ok 
Dec. 30 - .25 mg Xanax, horrible sleep maybe one hour
Dec. 31 - thought maybe ambien would be better to stick with, 10mg and still horrible sleep. Maybe 2-3 broken panic hours.

So here’s where I’m at. I took .5 mg Xanax this am but I do not want to be on Xanax bc I know it is addictive. It has helped me stay calm today but ultimately I need a few good nights sleep to get my body out of this anxiety of fight or flight hell I’m in. So my options tonight are Xanax, trazadone, ambien or nothing

I neeed some guidance. Doctor said try trazadone if ambien isn’t doing its thing. She mentioned I can do Xanax for the anxiety but it feels like too much.

1q1fj8f,Chronic insomnia isn’t something you “figure out” — it’s something you endure,"One of the hardest things about chronic insomnia isn’t the nights themselves.
It’s how invisible the problem is during the day.

Because if you’re functioning — showing up, replying, joking, working — people assume you must be fine. Or at least fixable. Like you’re just one routine tweak away from sleeping normally.

“Have you tried cutting caffeine?”
“Maybe you’re on your phone too much.”
“Your body has to sleep eventually.”

What they don’t understand is that eventually already came. And went. And came again. And still — nothing.

There are nights where everything is quiet. No stress. No scrolling. No racing thoughts.
Just lying there, eyes closed, mind calm, fully awake.
Minutes turn into hours. Hours into something that feels unreal.

It’s not anxiety in that moment.
It’s not bad habits.
It’s not resistance.

It’s your brain refusing to switch off — for no reason you can point to, explain, or out-discipline.

And after enough years, the exhaustion becomes secondary.
What really wears you down is the constant need to justify yourself.
To prove that this isn’t laziness, negativity, or lack of effort.
That this isn’t something you could solve if you “really tried.”

I’m not looking for fixes.
I’m not waiting for a miracle routine.
I just needed to say this somewhere people might recognize it — without turning it into advice.

1q195k4,"Almost three months of no sleep, I’m scared I won’t get to live a normal life","As said in the title I haven’t gotten any real sleep in about three months now, which is exactly when my dog died. I’ve always struggled with very poor sleep and insomnia since I can remember (I’m 19 now), but I’ve never gone more than three days without ANY sleep and now it’s just the new normal for me. It’s like before in my life there at least was a switch for „sleep“ and that it’s just gone now. It doesn’t even feel like I have the option anymore. Yes I am exhausted but not really tired in the sense, which is also really weird and unnerving. Thankfully I am going to start meds in about two weeks, the psychiatrist I’m seeing now wants to try some sort of SSRI‘s for me but I’m really afraid it will just stay like this forever. In my life I’ve been to the doctor for about 8 times because of bad sleep and no one’s ever helped me because „I‘m so young“ and they didn’t want to give me anything „serious“, so I’ve always just left without getting any help. Meaning functioning averagely with very little amounts of sleep and no feeling of rest whatsoever has always just kind of been my life, and now I’m scared that help is coming too late or something. I’ve also always had bad anxiety and struggled with my health in general, like headaches, light sensitivity, severe exhaustion, panic attacks etc. with no apparent cause. I’ve done multiple different blood tests and tests in general and I’ve always gotten praised like hell for my good results, which doesn’t really help because you’re still left with all your problems. My guess is that the symptoms I’ve developed over the years is basically my nervous system waving me goodbye over time and the death of my dog just kind of sent my body into absolute overdrive / hyperarousal. 
This feeling just sucks so bad, all my feelings are suppressed and it’s like my life is just going by without me. I can’t really enjoy anything. I also couldn’t properly mourn my dog and I feel like I’ve always struggled with any emotions ever because they were always just kind of too much for me and got suppressed or turned into something uncomfortable. 
If ANYONE is coming from a similar background as me pleasee let me know if you’ve gotten back to a state of actually „normality“ and if so, how. I just really would like to know that there’s still hope for me. The not knowing how things will turn out for me is what scares me the most about all of this.

I’ve tried to before but I’ve lost hope because my body and mind still won’t naturally fall asleep until super late. 

I’ve tried so many meds. Trazodone, seroquel, doxepin, hydroxyzine, lunesta, ambien, and amitriptyline. I’ve been on seroquel for 2+ years which I’ve had the most success with but the sedating effect wore off. Amitriptyline was also fine but had to get off it because of side effects. Lunesta was probably the most reliable one I’ve tried, even though I was on it for only 2 months (my doctor wants to find something that won’t cause tolerance for long term).

The biggest problem I have is physically falling asleep and more recently not being able to shut off my mind. Last night I got not even 3 hours of sleep and the night before that I got 0 hours of sleep. I used to at least be able to get a good night sleep after I got a bad one the previous night. But now it’s gotten so bad. I cannot for the life of me get my brain to stop thinking. It’s not even anxious thoughts or worries, my mind just gets bored and starts thinking of something like a song, what I want to do the next day, etc. And physically falling asleep because of that is also a big issue.

1q12fi0,I think I have FFI or sFI. I know there was a lot of people afraid of this illness on this forum.,"Hi everyone. I know there are a lot of scared people on this forum and I’m not going to be an exception, but I need to share my current worries and fears.

Since November 18th I’ve been suffering from insomnia.I thought my insomnia started from thinking about the moment of transitioning into sleep, which made me start fearing that I wouldn't fall asleep—or that very second when the 'light goes out' and one passes into sleep.

 During this time I’ve taken medications like Afobam and Ketrel. Right now I’m taking Ketrel and trazodone at night. Usually on these meds I would sleep 5–6 hours with awakenings and then falling back asleep. For about the last week though, I’m sleeping only 1–4 hours and then I’m not even sure if I fall asleep again.

It feels like I have dreams later on, but I’m not sure if they’re actually dreams or just my thoughts. When I wake up I don’t feel sleepy or tired at all. During the day I also don’t feel fatigue or exhaustion.  
I’m terrified that I have fatal insomnia that’s progressing. I know the first phase is quite mild and it’s mainly steadily worsening insomnia – just like I have now.

10 years ago I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and hypochondriacal behaviors, but that doesn’t mean I can’t be developing FFI/sFI.

My psychiatrist told me that I can rule out this disease and he also prescribed me Escipram for anxiety – the same medication he prescribed me 10 years ago for a different problem.. Still, I have doubts and I’m scared that I’m slowly developing the FFI/sFI.

I also have problems with the sharpness of my vision when looking at something far away. However, when I change my point of focus, the image is blurry for a moment and then sharpens up again. I also have mild dizziness/lightheadedness.  
Still, I think these two symptoms are side effects of trazodone and Ketrel but I\`m not sure and afraid this might be sFI or FFI.

1q10evw,Is that it ?,"Hello to everyone (happy new year for yall)
So i never thought about posting here, but i got to a point, to a level of hopelessness that i have to know is there anything for this.
(Im Hungarian, sorry if my English is bad)
So lets begin with im 16 right now, yes you heard that right, 16 with extreme insomnia due to severe case of restless leg syndrome.
Yeah i know, its a bit wild to have a thing like that at such a age but it is what it is!
So im having trouble with sleeping since childhood (still in ironically :) ) having hard time sleeping, staying in sleep, and to get dreams or a deep rest.
It really affected my development aswell, really left behind compared to others at that time.
It got to a pont when a couple years ago i was suddenly awake for 3 days, first, the doctor told me to take magnesium, melatonin etc.
Did it and stayed awake, by the end of the 3rd day my doctor said its enough so i got dormicum to sleep finally.
It knocked me out for 20 hours, never had that good sleep in my life!
After this, it was time to seek a professional, i really dont want to go in details long story short, had a big fight for years, given a lot of sleep drug etc. and then, I got my diagnosis 'severe restless leg syndrome'
Got pregabalin (75mg) for that, at first it was quite good, but still had hard time to actually dream or get a deep rest.
This went until i got a tolerance, okay, doctor said lets add it up to 150mg.
The same case with this dose too but from this after a couple months i was completely numb emotionally
Even tho i had a good environment, girlfriend, everything was going on not bad!
So then the doctor said lets get you back to 75mg to avoid this but to avoid the withdrawal too im gonna give you imovane (zopiclone) aswell to sleep
The dose was 3.5 mg's, at least on paper...
Because at first i got better sleep with this combo than with pregab. Alone.
But after all these years of not getting rest, having problems from my problems (trouble learning, focusing, numb emotional state, restlessness, irritating and sometimes aggressive behaviour from these) is all coming up to me and then i started to ""get everything in my hand""
Instead of the 3.5mg  imovane i started to take 7.5mg then 11mg than 15mg (that was the most)
But the crazy part is, even with 15mg i had trouble with sleep sometimes
But for the most part, this with the combo of pregab. Knocked me out for some hours, but still didnt get deep sleep, dreams etc.
Eventually, my parents found out of this and started to dosing me by their own with the first said 3.5 mg but they gave me 7.5mg at first to not come back too fast.
I didnt get any good sleep since years as i said, but for the past weeks, everything got way worse!
Until yesterday, when i had something going on with my mind...
I wasnt clear minded, confused and started to get angry and aggressive at the evening it got away eventually, but i wasnt clear minded still...
So i go with my evening sleep routine as usual 
(Because i have one perfectly timed and aimed for sleep, but it didnt help at all too, but still doing it for the circadian rythm and everything yk) 
Go to bed at the same time, but i was wild awake for 3 hours and then this complete aggressive behaviour came back i was even confused than before and i just wasnt myself at all.
Started to take alot of med to knock me off ended up taking 525mg lyrica, 7.5mg imovane, 0,25mg alprazolam (xanax) and i knew this combo could slow down my breathing  chatgpt even said i could die from this.
But at this state of mind and restlessness ?
I didn't give a single fuck.
I just laying there waiting for the meds to kick in and after they did, ofc i couldnt speak normally, having trouble coordination etc.
But i was still awake for like 2 hours 
(No, before you ask i didnt use any blue light 1 hour before bed and at this point still didnt)
Then i  was like, you don't want to sleep after all this meds, then FUCK YOU!!
so i started to use my phone with blue light blocking glasses and then eventually i got knocked out for like 7 hours...
It was the end for me, after all this, all this meds, im getting 7 hours of sleep with a short deep sleep no dream still? 
So im really hopeless, confused to what to do
Also to mention: im given  12.5/50mg parlekarv (dopamine precursor) and iron in tablets.
My doctor said this is so severe that opioids would be the thing that would knock this down to zero, but im too young to give me and the risks ofc.
My doctor is taking me to an ""experiment"" bc there is a new one, that people getting ultra- dose of IV iron (that reaxhes the Brain unlikely with tablets) is should help me really well he said.
What do you guys think? Ask me anything i answer but I need to know if there is hope at this point!

Every night I'm so tired I feel like I could pass out. But the second I close my eyes and start drifting off, my body jolts me awake. Like my body is scared of sleep or something.

Or I'll finally fall asleep for like 20 minutes and then I'm just AWAKE. Brain going a million miles an hour and I can't make it stop.

I've been like this for months now and I don't know what to do anymore.

My doctor just said it's stress and to try melatonin. I've tried melatonin, magnesium, and chamomile tea. Going to bed at the same time every night. NOTHING WORKS!!

And during the day I'm a complete zombie. My daughter called yesterday about my grandson and I was nodding along saying ""uh huh, uh huh"" and when she asked what I thought I literally had no idea what she'd just said.

The thing that scares me most is how I can be SO exhausted but my body is still totally wired. Mind racing, heart beating fast, anxious for no reason. How does that even make sense??

Last night I laid there from 11pm to almost 4:30am staring at the ceiling listening to my husband snore. My brain would NOT shut up and my heart was pounding like I'd just run a marathon.

I'm scared this is just my life now.

Does anyone else get that jolting awake thing right when you're about to fall asleep? Or that vibrating feeling in your body even when you're sitting still? What have you tried that actually helped even a little bit? How long have you been dealing with this? And does it affect your memory and focus during the day too or is that just me?

1q0nssm,Best CBD or non-THC sleep aid?,"I (33F) am a notorious insomniac :/ It stems mostly from childhood trauma that made it unsafe for me to sleep, and has developed into night-time anxiety, constant thinking, and sleep procrastination.

I've been in therapy for years to address the childhood trauma and that has helped of course!

However, it's like I CANNOT turn off my brain at night! Not even anxiety all the time, just constant thinking. I have even been meditating for years, and it doesn't help with my sleep.

I can have better sleep hygiene in general. (no screens within an hour of sleep, meditate right before bed every night). Even if I do improve my sleep hygiene, I think I will still find my brain running so much!

I currently take 10 mg melatonin and 500 mg of Gabapentin **almost nightly,** and have developed a high tolerance for both of them. Even with melatonin and gabapentin, I am only getting about 1-2 hours of REM and deep sleep, and like 5-6 hours of light sleep. I have tried GABA but that has caused shortness of breath, which increased my anxiety.

I have never tried CBD for sleep. I don't use THC anymore as it typically increases my anxiety and my thoughts.

So---do you all have any advice on CBD sleep aids that either don't include any THC, or have such minimal doses that it would be negligent? Or, is there a combination of **natural, non habit forming** sleep aids that have worked for you? I'd like to decrease my use of gabapentin at least!

I'm open to different ideas and thoughts here, and have dispensaries available IRL. Any form, gummies, tincture, etc, is welcome.

Thank you for thoughts and reading!",1767216230.0,2,3,insomnia,sleep
1q0lero,Brown noise help me fall asleep. Also nose strips. Not advice — just my story.,"Hi r/Insomnia,  
Sorry for my English — I am not native speaker, and not doctor. Just want to share what help me, because when I read stories like this, it give me hope. So… here is my story.

For 10+ years, I sleep very bad. I fall asleep late (2–4am), then wake up at 3–4am and can’t sleep again. My head was too loud — many thoughts, heart beat fast, feel like I forget something important. I try:

* magnesium (help a little),
* melatonin (not work),
* no phone before bed (still not work),
* Nothing help long time.

Then I try **brown noise**. I listen on YouTube — “brown noise for sleep”, 8 hours, no talking. Not white noise. Brown noise is more deep, like wind or far storm. I play on phone, volume low, on bedside table.

First 2 nights — no big change. But on night 3, something happen:  
→ my breathing become slower,  
→ thoughts not disappear, but… go far, like under water,  
→ I stop look at clock at 3am.

Also, I use **nose strips** (Breathe Right type). I have little problem with nose — when I sleep, one side close. So I put strip before bed. It help me breathe more quiet, no mouth breathing, no dry throat in morning.

Now:

* I fall asleep in 15–20 minutes (before — 60+),
* I still wake up sometimes, but not panic. I just listen to brown noise, breathe 4–7–8, and… sleep come back.

It not magic. It not work for everyone. But for me — brown noise + nose strips = first real sleep in years.

I don’t sell anything. No links. No “you must try”. Just… if you feel same — maybe your brain also need simple thing. Not fix. Just support.

Thank you for read. And good night everyone.",1767209589.0,3,0,insomnia,sleep

Please tell me I’m not alone.,"Please forgive my paranoia but this is making me paranoid about mad cow disease, SFI…. It happened randomly one morning when I came home from a long night. I was exhausted, and laid down to sleep like normal.

I didn’t have the normal transition of sleep, or normal waking up. And I “woke up” - got up really - every 3 hours. This is 1000% not from anxiety or overthinking. This is why it’s scaring me.

I still cannot really sleep. I have hypnagogic hallucinations and I think dreams… but it’s for such a brief time. My body is aware and cannot sleep.

Yes naturally I’m scared I developed a prion disease and I know insomnia is not the only symptom and I am trying not to convince myself that the other stuff will come later… but I’ve been reading SFI/mad cow disease is more common now.

I’ve struggled with sleep my whole life but it were mostly just a sleepless night together with some panic attacks like every few weeks. In the past 6 months I slept a maximum of 4 hours EVERY night with repeated completely sleepless nights and I don’t know who I am anymore.

I’ve made more than a few mistakes in the lab because of my sleep deprivation and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve taken nearly every supplement that’s in the budget of a student and I live in a place where doctors doesn’t believe young women to have sleep issues. Every time I seek help I get to hear „you are young, it can’t be that bad, maybe try to relax a bit more, fix your sleep hygiene“ and I don’t have the energy to fight for them to believe me. My parents think I’m faking or exaggerating and my partner sits next to the bed every night and listens to my cry’s for help. 
I don’t even know what’s the problem. My sleep hygiene is optimized to the brim and I’m doing nothing different than a few month ago. I just lay in bed and nothing happens. No thoughts, no pain, no panic just complete emptiness. I’m normally a really happy person but now I’m just an illusion of myself. It probably would get better if I could just ignore it and go about my days but it’s always the elephant in the room and I don’t know how to block it out.

1pzst1n,After a week with of 10 hours of sleeping TOTAL I feel like my mind is falling apart,"Hey Reddit, I should have come to you guys sooner because I have felt really alone in all this but at least I'm here now. I have fought with insomnia in long spurs multiple times throughout my life. The first time I was in my freshman year of high school where most weeks I averaged 2-3 hours a night, unless I got lucky for a week and could squeeze out 4 instead. That lasted about 6 months, and it was nothing but the small amount of conscious thought left inside of me thinking there was no way I live another year if even that. The second time was after graduating high school and getting a job that required me to be there at 4:00 a.m. every day. I lasted at that job for about a month, up until the work schedule did me in to the point of daily hallucinations and my inevitable resignation. Sadly I didn't magically go back to normal, and Instead spent a few months afterward doing everything in my power daily to fix my sleep schedule, just so that I finally quit seeing the hat man in my room 24/7.

 Now comes the third and current practically constant insomnia episode of my Life. It has been many years since that second episode and I have a wife and son, with a daughter on the way as well. Finally, after years of hard work, I had achieved the promotion I felt like I was working towards for decades instead of the years it actually was. The only issue was that I got the promotion while I was dead center of severe health problems, ones that had been creeping up on me from my lack of self care during my time grinding to impress those with the power and authority to give me that position I wanted. I have basically poker faced my way into succeeding just over the bare minimum amount needed to keep holding his position, but now my facade is showing more every day. I have used ambiguous notes my doctor was kind enough to write me along with a few other realistic excuses that weren't taking it too far, In order to stay afloat and not have to give up everything I've worked hard for just so I was able to admit how bad it was this time. 

Lately I've noticed a sense of mania creeping up in certain aspects, such as my texting and writing. If you want an example, take a step back if you haven't already noticed my ramblings, or how I constantly am using punctuation as many times as I can, and you will realize how excessive certain thoughts or sentence word counts are right now. It's actually annoying for me anymore because of the time it takes for me to get a single thought out, even though it was kind of funny at first when it became my standard. Last night I was downstairs as usual when my insomnia gets severe, because I do not want to interrupt my pregnant wife from the little sleep she can get either.

One night while on the couch I slowly felt myself get to the rare point of being tired enough to the point where I might fall asleep before 3AM just this once. I dashed upstairs to my bedroom and right before getting to the door, something seemingly jumped out at me. As I stood in this pitch Black hallway I noticed that where there would usually be light bleeding through the bottom and top of my door, there was instead something standing and or blocking that light from hitting my eyes (or so I thought). I decided to try and get my pupils to dilate enough to understand what I was looking at, And in doing so made a terrible mistake.

You see I had not realized the level to which I was sleep deprived this time around, because as soon as I tried to focus on what I was seeing. Suddenly it was as if it was directly in my face rather than before when it seemed to be in front of the door. And not only that but I had a thought that appeared in my brain so suddenly and was so much detail it might as well have been information being zapped straight into my environmental processing. I didn't just see something in front of me, my brain told me that what I was seeing was a 7-ft tall monster of a man. I dashed straight through the spot where I felt he was standing in a panic, attempting to fling open my door to no avail. After a few terrifying seconds I remembered my door actually opened the opposite way I had been trying to open it in, and so I flung it open and immediately closed behind me as I entered the bedroom.

 My wife immediately sat up terrified, with the first thing her half asleep eyes saw in the slightly less dark bedroom having been my goosebump covered body hurdling through the air towards our bed. I threw myself under the sheets and blankets and put a pillow over my head faster than humanly possible, and even though my poor wife had no idea what was going on she still tried to comfort me. I lay there and I shook the same a dog does when it just got a haircut, and the same night decided to sneak and play in the snow. It must have been 5 minutes before I could get a single word, And at least 10 minutes before those words made sense. I explained it to her, and she helped me calm down afterward.

 I didn't believe there was actually a man there in fact I knew for a fact he wasn't, but my body and instincts sure didn't feel the same. I thought the worst was over and told her I would like to immediately do everything I can to sleep, I closed my eyes and held her tightly. After only about 5 minutes passing, I begin receiving incredibly vivid in my head to the point of basically feeling the same as looking at real images yet my eyes still remained closed. I eventually got to sleep after my wife once again calmed me down and helped guide me as I tried to close my eyes and drift off to sleep once again, I managed to squeeze out about 5 hours last night and feel better than I have in the last week.

Here’s my story..

I’m 36 and was on prescription medication for over 10 years. One medication would work, then it wouldn’t, start a different one. And that cycle continued. At the end I was taking 100mg trazodone plus 50mg Zoloft with half a unisom. That worked but I was also probably destroying my brain. So I slowly weaned off the Zoloft and trazodone. Someone recommended Plant People WonderSleep gummies and that really helped me to wean off everything. I started taking that and a full unisom and I would watch chill tv (thank you Why Files) and not get in bed until I was ready to pass out… all this worked and I felt I had found the answer. Well that’s not working anymore. I can do all that and still lay awake in bed until 1am until I finally cave and take my dog’s Xanax (shameful, I know). I started reading in the living room for awhile but I still will lay awake in bed. I just purchased Magnesium Glycinate gummies (goli brand) and Mary Ruth’s Liquid Nighttime Multimineral— didn’t work last night but I’ll keep using in case they need to build in my system. I also have Lazarus Naturals full spectrum CBD/CBG/CBN capsules but haven’t noticed anything. Also THC is not the answer for me, has the opposite effect unfortunately.

1pzr0q9,Getting of sleep meds after 10 years of use,"Hey guys, fellow insomniac here.

As the post title says, I’ve been using Lunesta and Ambien pretty consistently over the past 10 years, alternating at different points, but never really missing a night except on occasion. Currently, I’m taking zolpidem 12.5 CR and it works pretty well for me.

I’ve only taken them as prescribed (i.e., one a night), and I’ve never had any side-effects from either drug. I’m not anxious or depressed; I’ve just always had a hard time falling asleep.

I’m getting to the point where I feel like it’s time to get off of it after being on it for so long.

I was wondering:

1. Has anyone else gotten off of sleep meds after being on it so long, and how long did your rebound insomnia last, and did you have any other symptoms?
2. I’m wondering if it’s possible to do a gradual step-down in dosage over the next 3 months, such as going from 12.5 CR down to 6.25 CR down to 1/2 of a 5 mg regular down to nothing. Have any of you tried such a method and did you have success with it?
3. There is also a more immediate motivation to get off of it. I’m looking at going into the military as a direct-commission officer (e.g., JAG, Chaplain, MD). Insomnia is a waiverable condition, but an active prescription to a sleep med would probably be harder to come by.  If I’m off it, getting a waiver shouldn’t be a problem.

1pznisd,Lunesta Reviews?,"Hi all!

I’ve been reading through some older posts about Lunesta and I’m just hoping to gauge how people feel about it. I just got prescribed the generic at 1mg per night.

About me:

\- I am diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety, Bipolar II, Autism, and ADHD

\- Not sure which of the above really causes my insomnia or if it is a mix of all of it

\- I’m currently taking Lamictal and Abilify daily before bed. I take clonidine and klonopin as needed for breakthrough anxiety and panic attacks. I was taking Trazodone until today

\- I have tried hydroxyzine for sleep and it did nothing for me. Moved to Gabapentin and it didn’t help. Tried Amitryptaline and it also didn’t help. Then I was on Trazodone (100mgs) for a little over a year and loved it, then it just suddenly stopped working for me. Switched to Remeron/Mirtazapine for a few months but it worked for a few nights, gave me intense nightmares, and then stopped helping me sleep. I went back to Trazodone a month ago, but no dice.

Anything i should look out for? I’d love to hear the positives and the negatives others may have experienced while on Lunesta or it’s generic. Obviously, I know medications are a unique experience for each person, so I’m going to follow my psychiatrist’s orders regardless, but it helps me when I know a general idea of what i might experience.",1767114401.0,2,18,insomnia,sleep
1pzkmyi,Anyone dealing specificity with constant wake ups,"My insomnia has gotten slightly better over the last 2 weeks, but obviously I’m not convinced I won’t relapse again. 

Even when it’s “better” I have this major issue of CONSTANT wake ups, so frequent I almost can’t tell if I ever fell asleep because I must be in such a light sleep when I sleep that when I check the clock I’m unsure if I ever fell asleep. The only reason I believe I fall asleep is because I’ll remember dreams. I wake up typically every hour (maybe more but I don’t check the clock sometimes)

I’m 22F who’s had severe postpartum insomnia (even tho my baby sleeps through the night in another room with my husband), I can’t tell if these constant wake ups are still a mental thing, or hormones, or maybe apnea? But I don’t have the typical apnea symptoms ",1767107712.0,2,2,insomnia,sleep
1pzk1vy,Suggestions to fix my relationship with my bed (I know that sounds odd),"I've posted in here before about insomnia issues, and my battle, progress etc with it. I am generally I think better now than a lot of folks, and this for me has mainly been through mindset - practicing acceptance the best I can, and trying to go about my daily life the best I can with only a few hours of sleep.

What I have found however is that I have developed a bad relationship with my bed. To ""fix"" my insomnia I would generally get out of bed if I couldn't sleep within an hour, go to the couch, read an easy book (Harry Potter is a current), and then curl up on the couch with a blanket, and sleep. This would generally give me around 5-6hours of sleep, which is livable for me.

I think what this has done however is given me a complex about sleeping in my own bed, to the point where my body has a very hard time doing it. 

  
I was recently on vacation, and slept fine in hotels, airbnbs etc.

I know that if I cannot sleep, I should get up, do something else (reading for me) away from the bed, and then return to the bed. I was just wondering if anyone else has more advice than this? tips n tricks, from folks that have delt with this?

1pzieju,Spent 2 Years Fixing My Insomnia. Here Is My Honest Tier List of Supplements.,"I’ve had ""wake up at 3 AM and stare at the wall"" insomnia for years. I got sick of reading articles written by bots, so I spent way too much money testing this stuff myself. Here is the ranking based on what actually works versus what is marketing garbage.

# S-Tier (Actually Legit)

* **Magnesium Glycinate:** The MVP. Most people buy the cheap stuff (Oxide) which is basically a laxative. Glycinate is the one that actually relaxes your muscles and stops physical anxiety. It doesn't knock you out, just helps you stay asleep.
* **L-Theanine:** The ""shut up brain"" pill. It’s the stuff in green tea. If you lay in bed replaying awkward conversations from 2018, take this. Pairs perfectly with Magnesium.

# A-Tier (Good, but pricey/tricky)

* **Apigenin:** It's basically Super Chamomile. Makes you feel heavy and sedated. It works great, but it’s expensive and you can build a tolerance.
* **Magnesium Threonate**: Technically the best for your brain, but it costs 3x more than Glycinate. Unless you’re rich, stick to Glycinate.

# B-Tier (Situational)

**Melatonin (MICRO doses only):**

* **The Mistake:** Taking 5mg or 10mg gummies. That is a massive overdose. It burns out your receptors and gives you a hangover.
* **The Fix:** Take **0.3mg** (300mcg). Seriously. Less is more here. Use it only for jet lag, not every night.

# F-Tier (Literal Trash)

* **Sleep Cocktails/Blends:** If the bottle says ""Sleepy Time Blend"" and hides the dosages, it’s a scam. They fill it with cheap melatonin and charge you $40. Buy ingredients separately.
* **Magnesium Oxide:** Look at your bottle. If it says ""Oxide,"" you bought expensive poop pills. It absorbs poorly. Throw it out.
* **Valerian Root:** Works okay, but gives me crazy nightmares and the pills smell like old gym socks. Not worth it.

My Daily Stack: 400mg Mag Glycinate + 200mg L-Theanine. Simple, cheap, effective.

I also pair this with Soothfy at night for a low stimulation wind down routine calming sounds and gentle structure helped more than any fancy supplement stack

1pzi6ko,How fragile is recovery?,"I had my first bad bout of insomnia over Christmas, 4 days of practically no sleep. It was like a wall of anxiety would spring up and wake me every time I came close to slipping into deep sleep. 
Finally somehow I got over that, then had about 4 days of really nice sleep. I had been drinking lots of sleepy time tea, magnesium, melatonin, trying to not watch anything intense before bed etc. 
Then my best friend got me a Christmas gift that made me really emotional, and all of a sudden that night I couldn't sleep. I got maybe 2 hours, and a one hour nap this morning. 
I figured a good cry over such a meaningful gift (memorial items for my late cat) would have helped me fall asleep but that is pretty much the only thing I can think of that would have kept me up.

1pzggpb,"Chronic insomnia isn’t a mindset problem, and I’m tired of pretending it is","One of the most exhausting parts of having long-term insomnia is how often people assume it’s something you could fix if you just adjusted your attitude or routine.

I know the advice usually comes from a good place, but hearing the same surface-level suggestions over and over starts to feel invalidating.
“Have you tried winding down earlier?”
“Maybe you’re overthinking it.”
“Your body will sleep when it’s tired enough.”

If that were true, this wouldn’t still be happening.

There are nights where nothing is “wrong.” No phone, no noise, no racing thoughts — just lying there, fully aware, while hours pass. It’s not anxiety or bad habits in that moment. It’s simply being awake against your will.

What wears me down the most isn’t even the lack of sleep anymore. It’s the pressure to explain myself. To convince people that this is real, ongoing, and not something I could solve with more discipline or willpower.

I’m not looking for fixes or encouragement. I don’t have a breakthrough to share.
I just needed to put this into words somewhere people might understand without trying to correct it.

I woke up an hour earlier super lightheaded, couldn’t remember the day before until hours later and confused.

I don’t drink or drug, but I did take 0.6 mg of Clonidine. Due to the cost of an ambulance , my wife never called.

When I got up from our bedroom 2 hours ago and an hour ago to use the restroom I became SCARILY DIZZY (face, hands and upper bidy all became tingly and slightly numb). During that 15+ seconds of the lightheaded/dizziness I held onto the wall in ABSOLUTE FEAR… 
- it ABSOLUTELY REMINDED ME of doing Nitrous out of a ballon or like laughing gas.
I’m not sure what this is im expecting but i REFUSE TO GO TO SLEEP.

I thought it was dehydration for the reason last week but tonight I’m absolutely hydrated. I also got CT scans last week (didn’t have a stroke) but my gallbladder was inflamed (had been puking for a week straight prior to the ER and IV bag).

In between I am losing 2-3 nights a week of sleep and I mentally and physically cannot cope with that amount of sleep loss as well as wondering if I can ever brake the cycle and live normal again or is it going to kill me?

The UK is approaching one of it's worst Winter this January where many deaths are predicted due to cold in elderly and vulnerable people. I fear due to lack of sleep that I fall within that category of vulnerablity. So to me; if insomnia doesn't kill me the Winter will. I am scared for my life.

To make things worse I have some kind of disease and infection so yeah, not doing very well at all. If it wasn't for having a cat who relies on me I don't know where I'd be now. Although in saying that; he is contributing somewhat as he won't leave me alone in the morning when it's breakfast time, even though I haven't slept. Of course he doesn't know that. Lucky for him he sleeps plenty.

1pz23k8,One day my sleep was gone.,"To get straight to the point with my problem. I never had a great ability to wake up with a lot of energy, but I always had the ability to fall asleep easily and feeling tired once the night arrived. But now it's the opposite. I spent a few months waking up with my heart racing (3/4 a.m.) and barely able to sleep.

Over time, I started getting headaches and a tic in my left eye. I was very worried for a few months, and it all stems from my hair loss problem and the use of dutasteride. I was very unlucky to experience thousands of side effects because, unfortunately for me, I had something related to constipation/prostate pain. All of this improved when I switched to Dutas, but I noticed problems with sleeping (my focus was on the dick pain ha)

I keep in touch with other guy  in the same boat (he still have issues even without taking the fills for almost 6 months). We both know this is purely anxiety as he talked with a professional. Because both we had bad experiences in our journey with the medication and reading bad stuff in reddit don't help.

Something I realised after spending two weeks with my girlfriend was that they were quite intense, with trips to many places, and that's when I really felt tired and was able to sleep (which she couldn't).

This makes it somewhat clear that the medication is not interacting with any sleep problems, because if it were, I wouldn't be able to sleep with or without it.

Currently **I can sleeep**,  but not feels like in the past, because night arrvies I don't feel sleepy or ready to go bed.. its just me deciding okey time to sleep.. I started to read books before bed to clear my mind. During the night I will wake up maybe once or twice but not hard to sleep (months before it was so hard).  I probs sleep averga of 6 -7 full hours.. not feeling crapy the next day or lost weight/maybe even get weight anyway.

In general my hormonal panel its great and my energy the same.  My tic its almost gone, headaches time-to-time but less..

1pyr1bm,Isn't it possible that many (maybe most) of the insomnia is caused by fear of dying (thanatophobia)?,"So, I was thinking about this a lot, and I am curious: what do you think? While the ""Set it and Forget It"" (Daniel Erichsen) strategy is powerful for treating insomnia, I also think it is also not the definitive answer and every person's insomnia has factors that influence why we are insomniacs and I believe that one of the strongest signals causing insomnia might be either hidden or apparent fear of dying.   
  
I had various experiences with insomnia. Initially, I entered a classic, text-book insomnia of difficulty initiating sleep, resulting in fixating to bed, then fearing illness caused by insufficient sleep. Now, I sleep generally pretty well, but I have this weird insomnia that, several days per year (maybe like 5 days per year), I cannot sleep at all and need to wait until the next day, but it is almost exclusively caused by external stress or anticipatory anxiety, or when having sickness, like flu... Otherwise, by sleep restriction, I am able to achieve pretty consistent sleep. 

Anyway, I remember pretty well what was the point when my insomnia improved, initially after the first problems with insomnia. Although it is scary to say, it was basically a self-resignation, and after being sleep deprived so much and laying in the bed, I told myself: ""Ok, I don't care anymore if I am gonna die or not now, because this is hell and I don't want to be remembered as someone who is like this, and there is probably nothing I can do with this anyway."" Since I was not suicidal, this was a positive change for me, and since then, everything started to be much better, and after like 1 month, my sleep was completely OK again.

I thought, if I would discover, more people might have this root cause of insomnia, realizing this can help many people, and I could put this in a book as one of the possible strategies for overcoming insomnia. 

While being OK with dying and resolving thanatophobia is also not easy at all and borders with philosophical and religious questions, it is something that can be done by following a good therapy intervention -- unlike forcing yourself to sleep, which is always impossible and counter-productive, and even escalates insomnia.

I was hoping whether you can write to me here whether you feel this might be your root cause?

1pyoswr,"Random insomnia with no clear reason, and very different feelings after sleepless nights","
Hi everyone,
I’m a student with a part-time job, but it’s not very physically demanding. I’ve been having sleep problems for quite a while now, mainly difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. On some nights, I sleep less than 2 hours, and sometimes I even stay awake the whole night for no clear reason at all. When that happens, my heart starts racing, my thoughts won’t stop, and I feel very alert and anxious.
The strange thing is that this happens randomly. It doesn’t occur every day, and I can’t predict which night will be a bad one. On average, it happens about 6–7 times a month, not consecutively. I’m wondering if that frequency is considered “okay” or normal.
Another thing that really confuses me is how different I feel after each sleepless night. Some nights, after not sleeping at all, I feel completely broken the next day — like my body is about to shut down. Even getting out of bed makes my heart pound, and I may experience panic, fear, or sudden anger.
But other times, after a similar night of very little sleep, I feel almost normal — just a bit tired and sleepy, but not like I only slept 2 hours.
I don’t understand why the reactions are so different when the lack of sleep seems similar.

So I don’t have the option of going into the bedroom at a certain time as part of a good sleep routine. When I can’t fall asleep for a long time, it is very distressing: I can basically only stay in bed, and the vicious cycle of anxious thoughts and insomnia intensifies. Where I live, it is very difficult to find a new apartment, so I am interested in the experiences of other people who live in a similar situation.
2. Evening routine: I know that a sleep routine is helpful. But as soon as I start this routine (for example reading or listening to an audiobook), the stress begins, because I am doing these activities with the goal of being able to fall asleep afterward. I also notice that I keep pushing back the moment when I turn off the light, because I am afraid of reaching the point where I once again can’t fall asleep. This then leads to me staying awake longer and longer, and of course that becomes a vicious cycle. As a result, the evenings are relaxing at first. But as soon as it moves toward sleep, it becomes stressful. It also often happens that the audiobook relaxes me completely and I am just about to fall asleep, but as soon as I turn it off, I suddenly feel wide awake again and the thoughts come back. I also haven’t found a good solution for how to listen to an audiobook while still keeping the phone out of the bed.

Thanks for any advice of those in a similar situation!",1767004814.0,0,3,insomnia,sleep
1pyikxr,I don't know who needs to hear this but,"I've been chronically insomniac pretty much my whole life. There would be phases when my sleep would be just too good but in few days/weeks back to the original mess up. No matter what tf it is. I've tried everything you could think of. Literally everything. What truly helped me was back to very basics. Force yourself to get tf up early. By 5-6 am you should be up and running (not literally) and stay anywhere BUT your bed. Sit in the living room, outside the house whatever whatever. And when it's bed time go to bed and try.. EVEN IF you don't fall asleep. Repeat. Your body is bound to shut down. Resist the temptations of sleeping in and taking naps. Once you do fall asleep (which I'm willing to bet on) try to keep the same schedule.  I've also found that no caffeine post 3-4 pm helped until I got my schedule back. 

Tldr - force yourself to get tf up nmw lazy tired whatever, do what you gotta do. No naps. Move away from where you sleep until it's bed time again. Repeat

Honestly I’m tired of having this much time, I don’t think brains are meant to be conscious this much. I know that caffeine is going to make this worse, but I’ve been lightly abusing my sleeping pills(super secret method), which is definitely more hazardous, so I think the effects of prolonged sleep deprivation might be better.

It also sucks how there’s always something to do, not specific to insomnia but it’s like I can procrastinate sleep with duties and wants, and vice versa.

There’s also that countdown until it’s just not worth it to even try, for me it’s if I’d get less than two hours I’ll just get up. I guess the inverse would be deciding between going to sleep and an energy drink fuelled all nighter.

1pyakhn,What medicine to request for travel when MMJ is not usable?,"I travel rather frequently to France, and out of a desire to not get put in the Bastille, I do not bring my MMJ with me. Without it, I often take several hours of rolling around to fall asleep. I used to be able to strong arm my way though it, but on my last trip, several nights of 2-3hr sleep eventually lead to hallucinations and a trip to l'Hôpital Americaine, leaving with a script for 5mg Zaleplon. 

It worked, insofar as it would keep me asleep if I fell asleep. However, falling asleep still required prayers and ancient incantations - I had to take it, and about half an hour later, I'd feel very slightly sleepy - if I could not ""catch the wave"" in the following 15-20 minutes, it would be back to several hours of attempting to sleep. My understanding is that Zaleplon is soft, it helps you sleep but you have to arrive at ""sleep"" yourself, largely. 

I appreciate my MMJ (2x Wonder Sleep gummies, total dose 10mg THC/10mg CBD/10mg CBN, 2mg melatonin) because of it's method - about half an hour to 45 minutes later, it feels like someone's hit me upside the head with a large rubber hose and I lay down and conk out within 10 minutes.

1pyaewe,How to accept being awake?,"Hello everyone,

I have been dealing with insomnia for about 4 months (22, M). It started after my nervous system got sensitized through a series of panic attacks. I had a really busy time with job interviews and university, and developed many physical anxiety symptoms (chest pain, brain fog, stomach pain, etc). I eventually had a panic attack after taking my stimulant medication too late and was not able to fall asleep. My body since has associated wakefulness in bed as being dangerous. 

The first two months were crippling. I quickly stopped taking the stimulant, but this did not help. For instance, I was going to bed at 10:00 PM, sleeping around 2-4 hours after laying in bed for 4-6 hours. Sometimes I wouldn’t even sleep at all (went three days sometimes). 

However, the last 2 weeks, I’ve seen a lot of success. First, my nervous system has been slowly getting desensitized. I see no physical symptoms during the day any more. Second, I was able to achieve normal sleep twice now. I’ve seen the most progress using an acceptance based approach. This is done by allowing the symptoms to exist and not fighting the symptoms. This has worked well for me for all other symptoms. 

Although this has worked well for other symptoms, it has become hard for me to use this approach for insomnia. After 1-2 hours, my brain becomes anxious and only further enables the loop. Does anyone have any advice to maintain patience? I’ve been using things like, “My body will sleep when it needs it” and “it’s not dangerous to be awake”, however these statements sometimes do not help.

I hope everyone heals, and thank you for reading my post. ",1766976351.0,3,5,insomnia,sleep

1py7doz,"Terrified of insomnia, but anxiety and OCD are getting worse and worse. I can't decide whether to start 20mg Prozac or not","Hi everyone,

I’m really struggling right now and could use some perspective. I have a prescription for Prozac sitting on my desk/counter, but I haven't been able to bring myself to take the first pill.

My anxiety and OCD have been spiraling lately. The intrusive thoughts and loops are getting harder to manage, and it feels like I’m losing control. I know I need help, and logically, I know this medication could be the answer.

But I am absolutely terrified of insomnia. The main reason is that sleep deprivation destroys me. If I get anything less than 7 hours, my mental state deteriorates rapidly and everything feels ten times worse.

My sleep isn't even perfect right now, I usually wake up 1-2 times a night to drink water and pee (I suspect this might actually be an OCD ritual), so the thought of medication making that even worse is blocking me from starting. I’ve read horror stories about people not sleeping for days, and knowing how badly I react to lack of sleep, that fear is paralyzing me.

I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place: stay miserable with the anxiety/OCD, or risk the side effects and potentially ruin my sleep which keeps me functioning.

Has anyone else who is super sensitive to sleep loss dealt with this? If you had insomnia, was it manageable? Did it go away? I really need a push one way or the other because I can't keep living like this.

1py73ct,"Classic ""can't sleep"" post","hiiii so i'm actually reaching a level of desperation to sleep, so please if you have any (gentle) opinions or tips, i would love to hear them:

I'm in my mid twenties, started to burn out back in spring 2025 (and just an overall unpleasantly eventful year). Listen. This ain't my first insomnia rodeo, but it is reaching levels I didn't know I could reach. I am aware that my chronic anxiety (+everything else related to burn out) is the main cause for my insomnia, **but** I need *short-term* help for sleeping *now*. 

* September and October were spent doing basically all-nighters (every night went as follows: i would sleep for 30 mins, be awake for 30-60 mins, sleep another 30 mins, etc). I would reach 2h **total** of sleep, *maybe* 3h.
* Then by the end of October/throughout November, I managed to gradually sleep for longer: sleep for 45 mins, be awake for 30-60 mins, sleep another 45 mins. 
* Now, I manage to sleep \~2h at the time, wake up for 1h, sleep another 2h. The most I can reached is 8h (interrupted), with an average of 6h total.

My main concern is further delaying my burn out recovery and/or potentially (re)triggering a psychosis episode (which happened in 2021 due to, you guessed it, insomnia).   
  
Things I have tried:

* **Trazodone & Seroquel**: tried a long list of meds, none of the other ones were helpful outside of these two. They both used to work really well, now gives me massive anxiety attacks *as I fall asleep* (which kinda counterproductive) no matter what dose i take. 
* **Meditation, stretching:** sorta helpful in transitioning from my day to going to bed, but does not help me fall asleep (or stay asleep)
* **the classics:** no screen time or heavy exercise before bed, not spending time in my bed outside of sleep, making my room cozy, etc etc
* **seeing a healthcare professional**: idk what part of the world you are reading this from, but that is not really an option for me at this time. yes I have tried. 
* **weed**: yes i am aware that chronic use of weed can be detrimental to sleep. yes my insomnia had been this bad even before i ever smoked weed. Yes I have gone long periods without any weed, no it did not make any difference in my sleep. 

  
I am reaching a point where using my brain for the smallest things, anything from writing a grocery list to reading academic papers (im a university student) is becoming no longer difficult, but genuinely impossible.

1py5z2t,Strange sleeping experience,"Hello, before I begin I want to start off that I'm pretty much new here so I wouldnt know much on how to phrase myself, and also that I just started writing this after the experience itself because I tend to forget things quickly.

So I just came back from a 15-hour long trip from bicol to bacoor and I was sleeping at the time when I was going home, it was pretty normal at this, I was however sleeping in the unusual way people would sleep in the backseat of a car, it was just one free seat at the very back and I tried to make the things we had as a cushion so i can sleep sideways and I would often put my legs in a cross legged position or even extend it if I could.

But when I got home It was 3am at that time and I was on my phone until 6am-7am because I was thinking of not sleeping at the time, that however went away because I slept at atleast 7:05am.

I dozed off quickly with my other arm resting on my face, the ""singet"" of my elbow on the entire forehead, my blanket covering some of the light so I can sleep, but then it started to get weird, I entered in I think a sleep paralysis state where I couldn't move, or do anything, I couldnt see anything outside because I covered it with a blanket, all I saw was a posterize very high contrast face looking image which I couldnt tell what it was or if it was the blanket or in my mind.

Although I was able to move a bit, I tried to move my arms but It wouldnt be doing anything at all, I also tried to put my eyes open when I was actually able to move my hands, it opened, but nothing changed on what I was seeing, then after the time I also opened the eyes, a few seconds whenever I inhaling and exhaling, I started to see numbers and letters rapidly appearing and getting larger. 

I ended it by moving my neck to the right which caused me to snap out of it, put my blanket off and came down from the bedroom to the living room, the whole experience was roughly 5-10 minutes.

The only question I have is if this was a sleep paralysis that was developing or if it had started already, or just something else I've never heard of, I put this in ""Insomnia"" because of course its a sleeping topic, and I'm now ending this here.

1pxw2co,I thought I had insomnia my whole life. I had untreated hyperadrenic POTS.,"After years of doctors telling me I must be anxious and need better “sleep hygiene” (which never worked or helped btw). I finally got diagnosed with POTS after having symptoms my entire life.

I’ve tried meditation, melatonin, klonopin, Ativan, trazadone, hydroxyzine, cbd gummies (one of the only thing to consistently work every night for years until it randomly didn’t one day), yoga before bed, reading boring books, extreme 3 hour long night time sleep hygiene routines, using flexeril, and none of these things working AT ALL when the insomnia was hitting me hard. I’d be up until 10 am despite it all! Then only sleep for 4 hours, not sleep at all some nights, be up all night one night and still can’t fall asleep the next night even though I’m dead ass tired.

Before my diagnosis I started realizing If I am sitting or laying down relaxing before bed, then I get up to brush my teeth or move to my bed or even just go to the bathroom and then lay back down, by the time I’m laying down again my heart is beating out of my chest. I’m sweating. I can’t relax or calm down all of the sudden. Nothing helps. I realized I was not having anxiety or bedtime rumination. Funny how doctors can tell you what your symptoms are, and you start to believe it’s true so you stop paying attention to your own body. My symptoms were purely physical this entire time after my whole life doctors telling me I was “just anxious”. Nope. I’ve been having adrenaline dumps. Not just before bed, but any and every time I change positions from laying down to sitting to standing.

I started treatment for my POTS which all I’m currently doing at the moment is INCREASING MY SALT INTAKE. I tried the sodium chloride tablets. They didn’t help that much- barely helped with my POTS symptoms too I think the drink packets absorb better than the pressed tablets. So I got Salt drink electrolyte packets that have 1000 mg of salt per packet. I drink 2-3 a day. On top of my normal sodium intake when I eat. I GET TIRED AT NIGHT NATURALLY NOW. I literally get tired at an appropriate time and i am able to fall asleep at night! I never got that “natural sleepiness” feeling before. I changed my salt intake and all the sudden I’m getting it. I feel like a normal person. I can’t believe it.

Stop listening to doctors who tell you it’s all in your head, you’re just anxious, you need better sleep hygiene. Stop letting them dictate what’s wrong with you. Pay attention to your own body. It might be screaming at you and you don’t even know because doctors are brainwashing you / dismissing you so they can be lazy and don’t have to do their jobs.

But I didn’t do this on purpose, and should have been asleep… I understand this is a form of sleep. But this was not caused by anxiety..

So I just had a big dinner and laid down. I fell asleep. I should have.. right? But the same exact thing happened. Three hours passed, my eyes are exhausted like I didn’t sleep when I opened my eyes… it’s completely out of my control. Something feels very wrong. Like something happened in my brain and it can’t sleep normally anymore.

I’ve had insomnia before but never like this. I’m literally surprised when I open my eyes. I dreamed again. But I was not actually fully asleep. I’m never aware like that, or half awake like that. No, nothing bad happened, I was feeling fine… everything normal.

I’m worried I have SFI but I know everyone’s gonna say I don’t have it.. but I’m so worried something happened in my brain. This has NEVER happened before and it’s completely not anxiety based. I wish I could explain it better… and now I’m officially terrified..",1766900114.0,0,19,insomnia,sleep

1pxfct5,Where to begin regarding solving the issue of my (probably genetic) insomnia?,"I have always slept poorly, even as a newborn. Parents had hell (especially in the early stages) getting me to sleep. I have always had bags under my eyes and I'm not sure if I've ever really felt what it's like to be completely rested. Maybe during my time being unemployed and job hunting?

I'm nearing 30 and really want to get this figured out. This isn't normal and I need to feel rested so I can perform my new job safely. Currently I take trazodone, melatonin, and magnesium glycinate to get to bed on nights before work but I still only get about 6 hours at best. Not sure where to go from here.

Oh, and the sleep is typically the worst when I have something to do. It could be anything. Work, deadlines to meet, appointments, etc. However I sleep okay on weekend days where I have nothing to attend to (without assistance from medication).

Bullet list of what I already do:

* Work out hard 4-5x a week (2-3 resistance, 2 cardio)
* Maintain consistent schedule (always go to bed and wake up within the same 1-2 hour window)
* Bedroom cool and dark as can be with white noise box fan (gets hot here, sometimes 78 is as cool as it gets in Summer)
* No napping and no caffeine after 10am
* No alcohol in the evenings
* No screen time 30 min to an hour before bed
* No eating 3 hours before bed
* Tried meditation/journaling but it's just too tedious and time consuming to do every day and offered minimal (if any) improvement

1pxej76,I'm afraid of taking medication,"Hi
I have had trouble sleeping since I was 14, and all the doctors ignored me because of my young age. Now I am an adult and am considering seeking medical help again, but I am afraid of taking medication because my insomnia is not that bad. The problem is that it comes back like a boomerang. I sleep without any problems for two months and then suddenly for the next two months, every night is a nightmare. And then one day it just goes away again. This situation has been repeating itself for many years, always following the same pattern. I am afraid that medication will take away those two months of peaceful sleep. 
Also...Are there any healthcare workers here? I'm about to start working at a hospital (night shifts, 12-hour shifts) and I don't know how I'll cope with something like this when I already have serious problems sleeping. Will medication help? Any advice?

1pxc93m,i’m scared,"i apologize for posting so much in this sub, but i need help

(here’s what i included in my last post, but below there’s more)
two nights ago i got 1.5 hours of sleep, i got in bed at 11pm, fell asleep at 5am, woke up at 6am, then i believe i went back to sleep around 6:30ish and woke up at 7:15. i survived off of an alani and my adderall in the morning. 

last night, i also got in bed at 11pm but could not sleep. i did something absolutely stupid and i’ll never do it again. but i drank alcohol to possibly help me sleep because i’m desperate atp. i had a shot of cinnamon fire ball and like 3 big sips of malibu. i’m 100ish lbs btw so alcohol hits me harder than most. it DID help me get to sleep fast, i think i fell asleep at around 4am, and woke up at 6:45am because i had work early this morning. 

i woke up feeling even worse than yesterday. i’m almost certain i was still partially under the influence when i woke up (that went away quickly before i left for work). but now today, my eyes are struggling to stay open. 

i’m having fever like symptoms, i’m cold, my hands are freezing and i’m shivering when the environment is not that cold, but parts of my body like my legs feel unusually warm. 

i’m randomly shaking even when i’m not cold at all. my heart is racing, when i lay down and close my eyes, i get the spins, sometimes when i talk, i have trouble forming sentences/words, at work i was reading a book to a kid and i was having trouble reading some of the simplest words and it was difficult keeping track of what line i was reading, and i’m getting mini panic attacks out of nowhere.

especially the past 4 months, i’ve been having worse sleep problems than i ever have. many times i’ll be drifting asleep when my brain finally lets go of the thought of sleep, and then my body randomly jolts me awake and i have a panic attack. i’ve tried melatonin gummies and xanax, and those stopped working. last month i tried ashwagandha gummies, and they were actually working, but now they are not. i’ll have this issue multiple times a month, and it always happens two nights in a row. it can never just be one night.

everything feels off and i don’t feel real. is this serious? what should i do? i’m actually so scared.

My anxiety spirals around sleep itself. I worry that if I don’t get enough sleep, I’ll mess up at my job (I work in makeup and need steady hands), drive unsafely to work, or have a panic attack — which has happened before. Once that fear kicks in, my heart starts pounding, my chest feels full of adrenaline, and sleep just doesn’t come.

I take trazodone, use medical cannabis, and I’ve even taken benzodiazepines at times — sometimes stacked — and yet my anxiety can still override everything and keep me awake. It’s incredibly frustrating and scary.

I do have a primary care doctor and a therapist,— and have been fighting this since 2022. Has anyone else dealt with this specific kind of insomnia? What helped you break the cycle?

1px4c3d,Mindfulness for Insomnia book,"I wanted to recommend the book [""Mindfulness for Insomnia""](https://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-Insomnia-Four-Week-Guided-Program/dp/168403258X) and share how much it helped me, in the hope that it may help someone here as well.

I’ve dealt with bouts of insomnia and severe anxiety around sleep over the past three years. It came and went, with stretches of months when I slept well, only to spiral again after a few bad nights. I got into meditation (using the excellent Waking Up app) and started mirtazapine. I also relied on lorazepam during the bad times to get some sleep.

The last time I spiraled, I decided I needed behavioral therapy. I dreaded CBT-I with its strict rules, went to one session, and stopped. I then looked for an alternative approach and found Guy Meadows’ ""The Sleep Book"" compelling, but I couldn’t “just accept” my insomnia, and the tools it offered didn’t work for me.

Knowing that meditation helped somewhat, I googled “mindfulness insomnia” and came across this book, which didn’t seem very popular. It offers a much gentler approach to healing through acceptance than what I felt when reading Meadows. Beyond an introduction to mindfulness (not the best source, but good enough), it focuses on two key elements I had been missing: self-compassion and acceptance. These weren’t missing from my meditation practice with Waking Up, but the book strongly emphasizes them and explicitly connects them to insomnia. It also keeps good parts of CBT-I, like showing how sleep is imperfect for everyone, especially as we get older.

It took time, more than the four weeks suggested in the book, but I truly feel I’ve reached a better place and have integrated the acceptance Meadows was pointing at. I know this not because my sleep is perfect (it’s good), but because when it isn’t, I’m OK with that. I still have bad nights from time to time, even sleepless ones, but they don't stress me out. I used to feel really anxious at night, during the following day, and especially when going to bed the next night. Now I’m fine being awake, and I usually forget about it the next day. I’ve fully internalized that these episodes are temporary, even if they last a few nights.

I don’t know if this approach is for everyone, but if anxiety is the main driver of your insomnia, I hope it can help you too.",1766858911.0,1,0,insomnia,sleep

I’m trying to understand whether what I experience could be paradoxical insomnia (sleep state misperception), and I’d really appreciate hearing from others who deal with this.

At night, I genuinely don’t feel sleepy at all, I feel awake and alert. However, during the day (especially around 3 pm), I feel very sleepy, sometimes to the point where my head starts dropping.

When I go to bed at night, it feels like I don’t sleep and that I’m awake the whole time. But when I check the clock, it’s suddenly morning, even though it feels like I didn’t sleep at all.

1pwtymy,Now I finally understand why I often wake up in the middle of the night around 2–3 a.m. and then can’t fall back asleep.,"For many years, I frequently woke up between 2–3 a.m. and was unable to return to sleep. I tried many herbal remedies and sedative medications, but none of them really worked. Those medications only helped me fall asleep more easily, but they couldn’t help me maintain sleep until morning.

Later on, I realized that the problem happened during sleep because of my left inferior turbinate. When I lay on my back or lie on my right side, the inferior turbinate in my left nostril would swell and block almost all airflow. But when I lie on my left side, it still maintains some space for oxygen to pass through, so I can sleep through the night.

However, I can’t stay on my left side all night. Sometimes I still end up lying on my back or on my right side, and on those nights I wake up very early, around 2–3 a.m., and then can’t fall back asleep. On such nights, my Mi Band 7 would report my blood oxygen level dropping as low as 88%. On nights when I manage to stay on my left side throughout the night, I don’t wake up in the middle of the night, and the lowest oxygen level recorded is around 93%.

After that, I went to see an ENT specialist. The doctor indicated a partial inferior turbinate reduction surgery on the left side. Now, one month after the surgery, I can sleep through the night in any position. I no longer wake up in the middle of the night, and the lowest blood oxygen level recorded by my Mi Band 7 is now 94%.

If you have similar issues, I recommend monitoring your blood oxygen levels during sleep and paying attention to whether there are any problems with your airway or breathing.",1766828361.0,24,5,insomnia,sleep

One friend suggested an app which helped him fix his sleep.

To give you an understanding on how I sleep  
I go to bed around 2am, wake up around 10.30 am, wake up about 8-10 times per night and go back to sleep 10-15 minutes later. And it's really annoying, I am on vitamins to help me stay and fall asleep, somewhat working.

Anyways, I downloaded the ""Insomnia Coach"" app, recorded my sleeping patterns over 7 day period.

Now I am up to the part where it will tell me exactly what to do, when to go to bed, when to get out of bed.

The question is: ""what is your selected wake time"" and I put down 10.30am since that's perfect for my lifestyle.

It says I should go to bed at 4:42am based on my average total sleep time of 5h and 33m.

I am so confused, I am going to bed at 4:42am and getting out of bed at 10.30am but I am dumbfounded on this really really short bed time.

I assume, which the app doesn't tell me why I am in bed for such a short time, that it's gonna make my body so tired that maybe I will get better, deeper sleep in the future?

If my average sleep time is 5h 33m but that doesn't mean I fall asleep instantly at 4:42am and asleep until 10.30am, that's why I am dumbfounded on why I should only stay in bed for 5.5 hours.

1pwcxov,CBD might have ruined my life,"That's a clickbait-y title, I know. My real perspective is nuanced. I will explain, but just know that I honor I ruined my life and am responsible for my own decisions/oversight.

**TL;DR: Took CBD daily for past few years through debilitating insomnia; eliminated CBD, sleep improved dramatically. Found real, sound empirical research demonstrating that CBD can hurt sleep in some individuals.**

*(Please be kind. This is my honest, lived experience. I know I am a bit of an idiot. I also know this isn't going to be the ""cure"" for many of you, but it seems to be mine.)*

Let me start by saying that I am 24 and have struggled with extreme insomnia for the past four years. I specifically remember the day it started: Cinco de Mayo of 2021. After a lifetime of sleeping perfectly every night, even under the worst conditions, suddenly, I was up until 5 AM with a mind that would not slow down. Blindsided and confused, I did not understand what was happening to me.

From never having to worry about sleep, it eventually became all I thought about. I would continue to suffer from debilitating insomnia for years. I became a shell of a person. For months on end, I couldn't muster more than 3-4 hours a night. My mental state deteriorated in every possible respect.

More context:

I have always been a perfect sleeper. My general temperament had always been mellow— the kid who can knock out immediately anywhere, anytime. Planes, bumpy car drives, odd positions. Just... a chill temperament by nature, little to no anxiety, and *always* the most excellent sleeper.

Even when I had a reckless period of time in my late teens/early adulthood where I was regularly on a chemical cocktail that, yes, was extremely unhealthy, this pattern remained. I was pretty wild around when I graduated high school, and this was EXTREMELY UNHEALTHY, but I mention this only to tell you how flawless my sleep always has been even under the worst possible conditions/sleep hygiene.

I tell you truthfully and without hyperbole that, for a period of about a year or two, I was on many milligrams of Vyvanse (ADHD medication/stimulant) daily, while drinking coffee, while ingesting nicotine (that is three stimulants!) both vaped and sometimes in gum for the extra kick. I was taking Lexapro at the same time, smoking a lot of weed at the same time, often daily. I would go days without eating sometimes just to lose weight. I was on a severe caloric restriction, while working out like a horse.

The point of this isn't to analyze how unhealthy my lifestyle was. The point is to say: even through all of this, I still slept like a baby every night, somehow. I could go days without eating and sleep fine. I could take stimulant after stimulant at any time of day and sleep fine. I never, ever, ever had to worry about sleep — before, during, or for a time after this episode.

That behavior subsided, eventually.

Then? Something switched at 20 (a year or so after that insane behavior dissipated) that has long been a mystery to me. The insomnia began that aforementioned night. I didn't understand why. In hindsight, the only two things I can identify that changed are the following:

\- I began supplementing D3 daily

\- & I began taking CBD daily (on average, 50-100mg in the mornings, daily)

**One critical variable: the very day the insomnia began, I started taking CBD oil.**

I never once considered that the CBD could have had any remote effect on my sleep. I considered it a net positive in every respect. To me, it was the one thing that I thought had any chance of helping. I took it daily, rigidly convinced I needed it.

Eventually, I began to accept my reality. I had a hard time sleeping. I began to adapt as well as I could. I went back to school and performed well enough, even on peanuts of sleep compared to what I used to get.

My mental state improved and I discovered things that could help, such as maintaining excellent sleep hygiene. My sleep was still very far from perfect— probably averaged 5-6 hours a night of broken up sleep. But I made do.

*(Let it be known: I ran the gamut of trying literally anything that could help. I added things and removed things. Magnesium, melatonin, sleep aids, everything under the sun. I read that D3 caused insomnia in some individuals, so I tried going without for a few weeks. There was zero measurable improvement, despite getting a blood test confirming that my D3 levels had dropped from 70 to about 50 as a result of the supplement's elimination.)*

However, never once did I even consider removing the CBD from the regimen.

That is, until several years later— I had a couple days where I felt so positive mentally that I felt I didn't need the CBD. I'm truly stunned at how rigid my behavior was— I'm definitely someone who could be accused of OCD-like thinking and behavior. I can get ensnared in rigid patterns of thinking and being in the world, so I really mean it when I tell you I never missed a single day of taking my CBD, convinced that it was the sole thing helping me get through the stress.

But, one day: I felt like I didn't need it, so I didn't take it. That night, despite incidentally poor sleep hygiene (was just too busy too late in the day to do my usual self-care), I slept near perfectly.

The same thing happened the next day.

I was a little stunned and confused... so, I looked into the pattern.

Lo and behold— somehow, I never discovered that CBD has been documented in research, and even clinical trials on Epidiolex (medically-prescribed CBD), to produce insomnia in certain individuals. *It is officially documented as a potential adverse reaction for Epidiolex.*

Further, it is noted that CBD:

\- Blocks adenosine receptors, which are crucial for feelings of sleepiness and tiredness

\- Is a POTENT inhibitor of the liver enzyme required to break down caffeine; therefore, if you drink coffee daily (which I do), the half-life of the caffeine ingested in the morning skyrockets. This can make it like having just had a cup of coffee at 8 PM.

I eliminated the CBD, and suddenly began... sleeping 8 hours again. Getting tired, turning off the lights, and just... falling asleep. I can't stress how big of a deal this is for me... I used to need to sit and watch TV for hours until I eventually nodded off. If I laid in the dark, I'd anxiously toss and turn for hours, wide awake.

To test, I re-introduced the CBD, and eventually the insomnia came back.

I am quite honestly floored. Ultimately, I am the idiot for my own rigid behavior and lack of serious research and insight. I should have realized that the day the insomnia started was the day I started taking the CBD oil and acted accordingly. But seriously: I never once considered that CBD could hurt sleep in any respect, in any capacity.

The truth is that it doesn't affect everyone the same, and for some, CBD can help; but my own n = 1 experience, along with backing from real research, corroborates the apparent fact that CBD can seriously hurt sleep in some individuals.

*CBD didn't ruin my life— but I may have ruined my life with CBD.*

Ultimately, I feel like I have my life back. I want to travel, I want to go camping, I want to do all the things that scared me before because I thought they would hurt my sleep. I feel free.

I know that this isn't the cure for many of you; however, if I myself found this post earlier, I may have saved myself from years of stress and insanity. It felt worth sharing. I wish you all the best.

And, I know I'm an idiot. Thank you.",1766777911.0,4,23,insomnia,sleep
1pwasxx,Thank you boring documentaries!,"After months of struggling with insomnia, extreme anxiety, and taking zolpidem every night the last 2 months, I decided to apply one of the tips that the people share in this group: to watch boring documentaries before sleep. I watched 2 hours (of a not so boring in the end) documentary in the Homo Deus channel on YT. In the first half hour I was doubting of this strategy, because my mind was very active and racing. At the end of the first hour I was struggling to maintain my eyes open. But I decided to watch another one hour documentary to overcharge my feeling of sleepiness. When it was over I was very drowsy and worried that I wouldn't be able to sleep without zolpidem, so I decided that if I didn't fall asleep within the next hour, I would take my usual dose. But I think that in less than 5 minutes I was sleeping. My surprise was this morning when the sun light woke me up, I was having a sweet dream about talking with other people about the sport I practice. And as I remember I never woke up in the middle of the night, as has been the custom in the last year or more.

For me this is a very special moment, because I was thinking that I couldn't sleep anymore without taking sleeping drugs.",1766772663.0,12,7,insomnia,sleep
1pwar2o,I cured my friend's sleep anxiety/Insomnia,"She was stuck in a cycle that she couldn't escape. Every night she wondered, ""Will I sleep?"" 

I felt very strongly that her problem was fixable, because of the anxiety component, and there being no other health issues involved.  I asked her to do 1 simple 5 minute breathing exercise before bed every night. Within one week, she was sleeping again. One year later, she still uses the exercise to have a really good sleep.

What changed? I don't really know, but my guess is we trained her nervous system to switch into parasympathetic(rest & digest) mode before bed. Most likely though, there were more than a few benefits like slowed down heart rate, relaxed muscles, and different brain waves. 

If you are wondering how to ""force"" yourself to relax, this is how. 

Rhythmic or parasympathetic breathing:
6 seconds in, 6 seconds out, 5 breathes a minute. Or for you musicians out there BPM 60 6/4 time.

Organic Passionflower Tops 100mg  
Orgnaic Hops Strobiles 50mg

Context:

My wife has been dealing with postpartum insomnia for 4 months. Can never sleep more then 4-5 hours in perfect conditions, no breastfeeding, separate room, blackout curtains, earbuds, eye mask, etc... you know the drill. I would have the baby through the night in a different room, she used to pump but we're now purely formula feeding him as an attempt to give her less interruptions through the night. A lot of the times she is only sleeping 2-3 hours a night. 4-5, is good, and 6 is the best she's ever gotten. Really broken up sleep too.

We've tried a handful of different things, Trazodone, Diet adjustments, CBT, therapy, etc... Nothing has really worked yet. Most of the times with the drugs or even supplements, she gets even more anxious after taking them because she is so mentally sensitive to any symptoms/side effects she has or might get. I try to talk her out of that. It obviously helps to just be consistent with whatever it is you're taking.

It started out as just insomnia, trouble falling asleep, took 3-4 hours, trouble staying asleep, would only be able to sleep in 1-3 hour chunks. 

Now, I have noticed that the anxiety has developed, and has grown quite significantly due to her anticipating the night not going well, and her lack of sleep leading up to this point. She can hardly do day-to-day activities. She's stay at home mom, and still has to have one of our moms come over every single day to help her get through the day. In some ways, I can start to see depression growing as well. Which, who wouldn't get depressed if they couldn't sleep and function on a daily basis right?

She feels like she's going insane, like damage is being done to her brain and body, like it's a cycle she can't break... 

We're trying to avoid anti-depressents. We just know that the problem did not start as depression and we don't want to become dependant on that type of drug, or any drug for that matter.

Anyways, I thought that this 'sleep better' supplement mix might be good ? Because it doesn't just try to help with sleep, but also has Ashwagandha for cortisol/stress, and a more balanced approach to the sleep/anxiety side of things with multiple different supplements. I also thought maybe adding in lemon balm to the mix would be extra helpful for the anxiety ?

I'm curious if anyone has ever tried this mix and what your experience with it was like?

  While benadryl WORKS, I do have to take it at least an hour or two in advance before it actually kicks in. I don't know if that's the norm but it feels like a long time.

  My insomnia has always been present but ever since I had my first experience with anesthesia it's now the worst it's ever been, and it's awful. Sometimes I'm wide awake for the whole day and night and other times I'll wake up after a full night of sleep and still feel so horribly fatigued that I end up napping through the whole day, which then throws off my entire sleep schedule. 

  I will add that I have POTS and EDS which are both known for causing insomnia among other issues like chronic fatigue and brain fog.

20 years ago right after my kids born. I had severe postpartum depression and some postpartum OCD.

Hola a todos,
quería compartir mi experiencia por si a alguien le resuena y, sobre todo, para saber si no estoy sola en esto.

Empecé con daridorexant 50mg hace poco por problemas de insomnio bastante severos. Las primeras noches fueron… intensas. Mucha activación interna, ansiedad fuerte, incluso miedo (sabía que era el fármaco actuando, pero aun así fue desagradable). Con los días eso se fue regulando y, en general, el sueño empezó a mejorar y por fin me tumbo y duermo. La primera vez hace 20 años. 

El tema es que ahora estoy notando algo que me cuesta explicar:
una especie de apatía física. No tanto tristeza ni depresión mental, sino como si el cuerpo estuviera en “modo ahorro de energía”. Me levanto, hago mi vida, pero me cuesta arrancar físicamente, como si la motivación corporal y mi chispa estuviera apagada. No es cansancio extremo, es más bien falta de impulso.

Soy una persona muy activa normalmente, hago deporte, me muevo mucho, y esto me resulta raro y frustrante. Por eso quería preguntar:

¿A alguien más le ha pasado esta apatía física con daridorexant?

¿Os apareció después de un tiempo y no al inicio?

¿Fue algo transitorio o se mantuvo?

¿Mejoró ajustando dosis o con el paso de las semanas?


Sé que cada cuerpo es un mundo, pero leer experiencias reales ayuda mucho.
Gracias de antemano por compartir 🙏

1pvwsqp,"doc told me that if I can't sleep, I should get up - and do what?","I'm 68 F and haven't had a decent sleep in probably 15 years. I go to sleep fairly easily but when I wake up at 2 or 3 AM to use the washroom, I don't go back to sleep properly - I just doze from that point on until I actually get up. I really struggle if I have anything important to do the next day - those are my worst sleep nights. I did a sleep study a few weeks ago. It did indicate insomnia with reduced REM and 38 periods of wakefulness over a period of approximately 6 hours. Luckily no sleep apnea detected.  
  
The doctor recommended that I set an alarm even though I'm retired. I don't get the benefit. He explained that my mind would be more settled because I wouldn't have to worry about sleeping in. I can get up when I please, go to bed when I please. It's not like back in my work days when I would check the time and find it was like 5:30 and then I would be panicking because I need more sleep but I have to get up in an hour. That's no longer a concern for me so I really don't see how setting an alarm could help. I'll try it but I'm not getting the logic.  
  
Another recommendations is that when I wake up and if I don't go back to sleep within \~20 minutes I should get up - and do what? No screens allowed. Due to ADHD, I can't read a book - I just read the same page over and over and my mind drifts. Very boring/frustrating and not at all relaxing which is the goal. I could listen to a podcast but I can't imagine just sitting there doing nothing else but listen to a podcast. I often listen to audiobooks or podcasts but always when I'm doing something else like sewing, housework, and often on screens. I live in a very small space so if I'm making noise in the middle of the night, that will wake my husband.   
  
The doctor could not understand why I would have difficulty with his suggestions. I want to give his plan an honest try in the new year but I feel we are not on the same page and kind of talking past each other if that makes sense. Does anyone have any suggestions for me?

1pvn4d4,Edibles for sleep?,"So there have been times where I’ve gone 2 full days without sleep. Sometimes I lay down in bed and my mind just won’t shut down, I’ll start hearing music/noises/ and having random anxiety inducing thoughts. To the point where I just stay up all night laying down in bed, as someone who works in a high precision job, it’s incredibly hard to function on these days, and then sometimes this snowballs into a series of nights (that go on for weeks) where I’m just too scared to try sleeping, because I anticipate that I will struggle. Thankfully this isn’t nightly for me, it happens about 2-3x a month, the rest of the nights I can get a good 5-6 hours of sleep, but this has been going on for about 8 years and I have only been on 1-2mg of eztazolam this year.

However, yesterday it got really bad cause for the first time ever I went the entire night without sleeping, like at all. My main problem with sleep was that I’d fall asleep very late in the night like 4am or 6am, which is why I was prescribed trazodone which works but not always. I don’t even feel that sleepy right now which worries me even more that I have Fatal Insomnia.

1pvj67q,Severe insomnia after a trauma,"Hi everyone,

Im writing this because i feel exhausted and honestly desperate, and i hope someone here can relate or give perspective..

About 9 months ago, I went through a very intense emotional trauma related to a relationship. The relationship itself ended, and psychologically i thought i had moved on. The intrusive thoughts i used to have became much less, and mentally I felt “better” compared to before.

However, my sleep never recovered.

Since then, I’ve been struggling with severe insomnia, but not the typical kind.

It’s not that my mind is racing with thoughts..it’s more like my body refuses to shut down..

At night, my nervous system feels constantly alert.

I feel hyper-vigilant, tense, and afraid of the night itself.

Sometimes my mind feels blank, but my heart is racing and my body feels on edge.

Over time, i developed a strong fear of not sleeping.

The thought of “what if i don’t sleep tonight again?” triggers panic attacks, crying, and extreme anxiety.

I tried multiple medications (including antipsychotics and anxiolytics prescribed by doctors), and while some of them forced sleep occasionally, they never fixed the problem. Sometimes even with medication, I stayed awake all night, fully alert.

Because of how bad it got, I started to:

	Monitor my sleep obsessively

	Count hours

	Fear going to bed

	Feel devastated watching everyone else sleep while i stayed awake

This cycle completely stopped my life

I couldn’t work, couldn’t go to the gym, couldn’t plan anything everything revolved around sleep.

I’ve had health anxiety (hypochondria) in the past, years ago, where i feared heart attacks and strokes. Back then, I had extreme anxiety but no insomnia at all. That’s what confuses me..

Why now? Why insomnia this time?

At my lowest point, I even started thinking irrationally like maybe i was cursed or “affected by something external” lol even though rationally i know this is anxiety and trauma. When you don’t sleep for days and your nervous system is constantly activated, your mind looks for any explanation..

Recently, I made a decision to stop fighting..

Instead of forcing it, I tell myself

“If we sleep, we sleep together.

If we don’t sleep, we stay awake together.”

This mindset helped a bit it reduced the fight but the fear still comes in waves, especially after a bad night, I haven’t slept since yesterday..

Right now, Im extremely tired, emotionally drained, and scared of another night without sleep. I know logically that lack of sleep won’t kill me, but my body doesn’t believe that at night..

I’m not asking for medical advice..

I just want to know

Has anyone experienced trauma-based insomnia like this?

Fear of sleep itself?

Hyperarousal instead of racing thoughts?

Panic attacks centered around “not sleeping”?

If you’ve been through something similar and recovered, I’d really appreciate hearing your story.

1pvizal,Newley Sober with Trouble sleeping,"25M I recently got sober after abusing alcohol for about 4 years. It got to that point where I would only fall asleep if I had a lot to drink that night which is not sustainable. I saw a psychiatrist recently and was prescribed seoquel. It helps but I don't feel as rested as I would have if I actually had a good night sleep and it makes me very groggy in the morning. 

Here's my routine so far:

\-No screens 1-2 hours before bed, I'll usually read a book, journal, etc.

\-No caffeine/alcohol period no exceptions

\-All lights completely turned off 

\-Box fan for white noise as well as good quality ear plugs

I never force myself to sleep. If I'm still awake 15-30 minutes I'll get up and do something menial and boring. The issue I have is that I ""miss the target window"" as I like to call it. I'll be doing something like reading and I'll find myself nodding off. So I'll stay out of bed just to make sure I'm actually tired, and sometimes I'll ""miss"" the right moment to go bed and I just become wired again. It's so frustrating. Anyone else experience this?

1pvgjg2,Does magnesium really help with sleep or am I just fooling myself?,"Honestly I’m still not totally sure if this is placebo or not, that’s kinda why I’m posting.

I’ve had sleep problems for almost a year now. Mostly can’t fall asleep, or I fall asleep and then wake up after like 2–3 hours feeling wide awake. Sometimes my heart would randomly start racing, other times my brain just would not shut up. Nights were the worst part of the day for me.

I kept seeing people here talking about magnesium for sleep, so eventually I gave in and tried it. First thing I used was magnesium glycinate. For me it didn’t really do much. If anything I felt a little more restless, which was confusing. Maybe wrong dose, maybe my body just didn’t like that form, idk.

After that I switched to finemagtotal magnesium. I mainly chose it because it has multiple types of magnesium, not just one. I wasn’t expecting much tbh, I kinda assumed it’d be another supplement that ends up doing nothing.

First week… nothing. Almost stopped taking it.  
But around day 8 or 9 something felt different. I started getting sleepy earlier at night. When I laid down, my thoughts didn’t spiral as hard. That “wired but tired” feeling wasn’t as intense anymore.

Now I’m sleeping about 6–7 hours most nights. I still wake up sometimes, but I can fall back asleep way easier. It feels more natural, not like I’m forcing myself to sleep or knocking myself out.

Is it magnesium? Is it placebo? I honestly don’t know. Could be coincidence. But this is the first thing in a long time that actually made a noticeable difference without making me feel weird or groggy the next day.

Just wondering if anyone else experienced something similar.

1pv5edc,Don't fight it or it will ruin your life - My story since June 2018,"Story Title: My War with Insomnia 2018-2025

  
My war with insomnia started in June 2018 after a very stressful 1st year of Master's studies in France, which itself was followed by a childhood/ teen years filled with family arguments, poverty, and stress accumulated in order to succeed in life.

It came out of the blue, as maintenance insomnia one night: went to sleep between 10 and 12 PM , woke at around 4:30-4:47 AM.  I thought it'd go away, and it eventually did one month later, when I was just traveling around, having fun, and basking in the sun while surrounded by nice, friendly people.

Then the autumn months came, I was in Istanbul for my 2nd year of studies, and the sleep issues came back.

I did not waste a minute: went to medics, took magnesium (which worked for a little bit), saw all types of professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, psychoterapists, psychoanalysts, even talked to a witch. Took all sorts of pills, got bloodwork done, tests over tests, over tests.

I started being prescriped harder and harder medication until I was prescriped clonazepam (kolonopin/rivotril). At the beginning it was heaven, it was wonderful, but in just a couple of months hell would break loose.

I was initially prescriped 2 mg of clonazepam but now, after 1 year of trials, I am down to 0.5 mg and will soon cut it all out.

During these almost 8 years I did achieve quite a few things, but I have lost much more, and that because I fought insomnia with all I had. I no longer had a life. All time and money would go into finding solutions that never worked or got me in a worse state than when I started. 

I lost a great relationship, great opportunities, and even messed my health up more in the process.

HOWEVER, one important piece of advice: If you drink and smoke, quit both of them, they will harm your sleep the most.

  
TLDR: So, in conclusion: don't fight it. Wake up when you do, drink some tea, change your work place , or friends group, or living space/citiy/country if it is too stressful and unhealthy, but don't let it rob you of your life like it did for me.

1pv4ss9,Terrified I've lost the ability to sleep.,"
I’m posting this because I’m genuinely scared and don’t know what to do anymore.
For the past week, my insomnia has become extreme. I don’t just sleep badly. Most nights I don’t sleep at all. I close my eyes and just lie there.

Lately, the only way I’ve managed to sleep at all is by taking 0.50mg Xanax and drinking valerian tea. Without them, nothing happens. No drifting off, no drowsiness, nothing. Just hours and hours of lying there awake. This has turned into sleeping every other day, or after being awake 30+ hours, which is terrifying.

It all started a week ago. I've always been a night owl. But a week ago I had to wake up very early and my anxiety prevented me from getting any sleep through the night. Ever since that night, it's like a switch was flipped and my body doesn’t seem to know how to shut down anymore. I don’t nap. I don’t crash. I just lie there in the dark wide awake and desperate. I've tried magnesium, melatonin, herbal teas, have excluded caffeine all together, cold temperature. Nothing seems to work so far. 

I’m scared I’ve lost the ability to sleep naturally and worried about depending on medication. Has anyone experienced this, staying awake for days or sleeping every other day? Did your sleep ever return on its own?

I started experiencing this at 31 years old. I would wake up wired around 02.30-03.00, and it would take 2+ hours until I came down enough to be able to fall back asleep. Not each night, but often enough for it to be a serious matter.

I quickly found that Ambien would counteract it, and allow me to fall back asleep wiithin 15 mins. However, that was obviously just masking the underlying problem, and I couldn’t accept it as a permanent solution. For me, it was unrelated to stress. I connected it to some biological function, but couldn’t for years find a cause or a solution. I tried so many different remedies, without luck. Until suddenly.

Turned out, for me, it was my body’s acid-base-balance. I now just take a tea-spoon (flat) of bicarbonate in a small glass of water and drink it when it happens. Within 5-10 min I start noticing how everything starts to calm down again. After 30 mins I’ll be sleeping. Magic.

**TL;DR**  
My mom was diagnosed with dementia Alzheimer’s biomarkers at the same time long standing untreated syphilis was discovered. She has severe fluctuating environment triggered episodes with explosive outbursts rage paranoia verbal storms impulsivity mania slurred speech fast talking clammy skin jerking movements accent changes possible incontinence and fatigue after episodes. She often returned to baseline between episodes but in the last few months recovery has taken longer. Penicillin injections briefly returned her to normal baseline but after an MRI with contrast she declined rapidly. A new MRI now shows temporal lobe thinning that was not present before. Doctors are defaulting to worsening Alzheimer’s and offering Zoloft and antipsychotics while refusing EEG delirium workup or further evaluation. I am trying to understand if this sounds like delirium with an underlying cause such as seizures metabolic issues or infection and whether it is reasonable to keep pushing for further workup or if I should stop.





Hi everyone,

I am posting because I genuinely need outside perspective. I am not looking for a diagnosis. I am trying to understand whether I am being pushed to give up because of a dementia Alzheimer’s label or whether something treatable is still being missed and I should keep advocating.

I am a full time caregiver for my mom. Last year she was diagnosed with dementia Alzheimer’s biomarkers that doctors said were environmental not genetic. At the same time she was diagnosed with syphilis which she likely had untreated for ten to fifteen years. Since the dementia label went into her chart it feels like everything else I report gets dismissed and often is not documented unless it fits the Alzheimer’s narrative.

**How this started**

About a year before the dementia diagnosis my mom suddenly started talking to photos. This came completely out of nowhere. One month she was in physical therapy and taking computer classes. The next month she was being scammed online and speaking to pictures. She had no noticeable cognitive issues before this other than subtle handwriting changes and some trouble reading that occurred years earlier and were not very noticeable.

Doctors thought it was a UTI. She tested positive and was treated with antibiotics. There was a clear period where she returned completely to normal. I had my mom back. They said it was delirium and that it would pass.

During the untreated UTI period she became emotionally unstable. She cried suddenly in appointments which was very out of character. She was labeled depressed and put on antidepressants. Around that same time she was suddenly diagnosed with severe depression grief trauma and borderline PTSD. None of this had existed before.

After starting antidepressants she had her first major episode. I was in a store and she was waiting in the car. She suddenly ran inside panicking saying someone had hit our car and we needed to leave immediately. There was no damage no car nearby and nothing had happened. She was terrified paranoid and irritable. I believe she was holding a pamphlet with a photo at the time.

Antidepressants were stopped after a few weeks. That year she had three or four similar episodes spaced far apart. She continued talking to photos occasionally but calmly until she became irritated with them and wanted them to go home.

**Metabolic issues mold and temporary improvement**

Later a functional medicine doctor found high mycotoxins TVOCs low mitochondrial function and inflammation. We started a protocol. There was confirmed mold in the home though we could not fully remediate.

She had been malnourished close to one hundred pounds. Over time with nutrition and the functional medicine protocol her weight improved. Her cholesterol normalized. Her blood pressure was normal. Her mobility and functionality improved.

Around this same time we discovered syphilis.

She also has diabetes. Her levels had been normal for years but then suddenly started having high and low spikes. We later found out she had unknowingly been using expired unrefrigerated insulin for months while waiting for a new prescription. The same month I first noticed her talking to photos is when she started using that insulin. Once she got new insulin there was another period of clarity and she did a bit better than before. Now they are discussing possibly weaning her off insulin.

Then came penicillin injections for syphilis. After the second injection it was like having my mom back again. Clear thinking normal movement normal personality strong memory and no episodes. I do not recall her talking to photos during this short period.

**Things started getting worse again**

Before finishing the penicillin course she had a brain MRI with contrast. After that things went downhill again. Episodes returned and escalated.

At first episodes only happened at home. If I took her out she was completely normal. At home she would look at objects like glass sinks shiny surfaces screws and door hinges and see people she knows in real life. At first she talked to them calmly. I used to call this trauma loops because the people were real and connected to past trauma stories.

Over time she began including people she wished she had in her life even if they were not real and confabulated storylines connected to the original trauma. This turned into sudden explosive outbursts with fear feeling like intruders were in her home since she did not invite them in high paranoia high anxiety impulsivity and extreme agitation.

During episodes she shows constant swearing which is not her at all temper tantrums verbal storms lack of filters and judgment hostility erratic behavior OCD like cleaning and fight or flight responses. These behaviors only occur during episodes.

Before the last few months she always returned to her normal baseline. Recently baseline includes more confusion and short and long term memory issues that come and go after episodes. She can still regain memories later but it takes time and seems dependent on the intensity and duration of episodes.

**New neurological and physical signs**

Earlier MRIs showed only normal aging small vessel changes white matter changes and atrophy considered within normal aging. In the last few months a repeat MRI without contrast showed new temporal lobe thinning that was not present before. I believe this is connected to the worsening episodes. I was told it does not appear to be from white matter or small vessel disease and no further workup was done.

During episodes she now shows:

• Jerking movements  
• Slurred and rapid speech  
• A new accent she never had  
• Clammy skin  
• Increased heart rate and blood pressure  
• Labored breathing  
• Facial tremor when frightened  
• Possible incontinence  
• Sudden rage immediately on waking  
• Inappropriate laughing  
• Behavior disproportionate to events  
• Paranoia about intruders who are people she knows  
• Confabulated stories attached to objects  
• Constant reprimanding and authoritarian behavior  
• Gaze scanning before episodes  
• Belief she suddenly became a millionaire  
• Misidentifying people  
• Apologizing afterward and saying she feels anger coming on

She has also developed:

• Snoring for the first time in her life  
• Sleeping with mouth open  
• Repetitive involuntary mouth movements  
• Blowing air out of her mouth upon waking  
• Rash on palms and soles more persistent on soles  
• Patchy hair loss  
• Headaches and sore throat complaints  
• Increased fatigue with early waking  
• Tooth loss years ago  
• Very dry flaky skin  
• Random foot pain tingling and numbness  
• Mild retinal inflammation and abnormal eye movements  
• Floaters  
• Ear pain pressure and sound sensitivity

Currently she has temporal lobe thinning persistent white blood cells in urine without a UTI no bladder infection no cold or flu for years. The only persistent infection known is syphilis as titers have not gone down. There has been no new lumbar puncture or CNS evaluation in the past year.

Episodes are triggered by objects in the house fatigue waking hunger eating insulin timing or needing to urinate. Outside the home this used to disappear completely though in the last two to three months it has occasionally occurred outside as well.

**The biggest issue**

Once Alzheimer’s biomarkers were documented further investigation stopped.

EEG was refused despite jerking movements and slurred speech.  
Sleep study was refused despite new snoring breathing changes and severe waking episodes.  
ENT was not pursued despite ear symptoms and cysts.  
Infectious Disease dismissed late or neuro syphilis without proper evaluation.  
Some doctors called the case complex and even suspected neurosyphilis but defaulted to worsening Alzheimer’s instead.  
Medical records rewrite my reports as behavioral issues due to dementia and do not reflect what I am actually reporting.  
Antipsychotics are offered and I am told to accept rapid decline.

One neurologist warned me to delay antipsychotics if possible due to risk of rapid decline. A neuropsych initially thought delirium and possibly neurosyphilis but later backed off after reviewing records that did not reflect my reports.

She voluntarily hospitalized herself as a walk in because she wanted help. She was calm in the hospital so they did not see what happens at home. Neuro rehab and further testing were denied because she appeared too functional. Another UTI and active syphilis were found but results came back after discharge. Leukocytes in urine persist. I was told verbally she was serofast but records say latent. CDC told me those labels do not apply when symptoms are present yet no re evaluation has been done.

**Why I am here**

Her pattern looks like hyperactive delirium. It is fluctuating state dependent and environment triggered with periods of recovery. It also looks like possible seizure activity metabolic encephalopathy and or late or neuro syphilis.

Yes she may have dementia biomarkers but I want to rule out treatable causes before masking everything with antipsychotics and potentially accelerating decline.

I am trying to understand if continuing to push for EEG another Infectious Disease opinion and further neurological evaluation makes sense or if I am missing something obvious and should stop.

Does this sound like just worsening Alzheimer’s or does this pattern suggest delirium with another driver? Has anyone seen seizures metabolic issues or infections dismissed because of a dementia label? Is it reasonable to keep pushing for EEG and further evaluation? Has anyone managed to get an EEG or Infectious Disease consult without a referral?

She is currently safe at home with 24/7 supervision but episodes are becoming harder to manage alone. I have no help managing her care and I am burned out. I do not want to give up if there is something underlying that could still be addressed.

Any insight experience or guidance would mean a lot. Thank you for reading.

1puzv0n,First time taking zopiclone,"Hi, i want to share with you my experience with Imovane drug(zopiclone) and hear about your experiences. 

I have ADHD and have big problems with falling asleep. All my life i was taking too long time to fall asleep to the point of me not wanting to go to bed until i was passing out of tiredness. Even when my body was barely functional my brain was still active. Taking stimulants for adhd make it worse. 

I ve hade lot of attempts of fixing sleep with meds but it ended up on taking it too late and feeling tired all day or just feeling tired regardless of time of dosage. There were months of active use of those meds and multiple breaks. 

My psychiatrist prescribed me zopiclone and told to use it only if needed and take 3,7mg in the beginning and watch out to not get addicted. 

Last couple days i was going to sleep around 4-6 am becouse of failed  attempts of reseting sleep schedule by staying awake all night. In the result i slept around 8h in 2 days and felt barely functional yesterday at the evening. I was chugging coffeine to get to the end and then after helping in home, playing some games and talking with friends i ended up at 4 am. 

Magicly my body suddenly felt active and i was just a bit drowsy. I didnt meant to take meds first time that late but i just had to. I accidently took one pill instead of half. 

After 15 minutes i ve starded seeing weird things looking at my phone. Screen started to feel like it was 3d. When i was tillting my phone instead off seeing side i was seeing nothing, like it was just a screen not a object. After split second it was there again. It was really trippy. I was looking at this anomaly for 15 minutes. Then i look up at my flower pot and flowers were moving, like it was alive. While reading instead of hearing my inner voice i heard someone else. Female one and it was horrifing. Random melodies started to play in my head. 
Then shadow of my chair was moving like it was smoke. 

I was really scared. I knew it was side effect and it wasnt real but it just fucking scary to see and hear thing that arent happening. After some more time i went to sleep. 

That was wild. I know some things just added up and that was cause of it but holy fuck. ",1766618038.0,2,1,insomnia,sleep

I'm one of those people who can fall asleep within 15 minutes, no problem, I'm lights out by 10:30 PM. But every single night, without fail, I am wide awake between 2:45 AM and 3:30 AM.

I've tracked this religiously. My average actual sleep time is maybe 5.5 hours, even though I'm in bed for 8.5 hours. I've tried all the ""sleep hygiene"" tips, no screens after 8 PM, cold room, white noise, etc., and I feel like I'm doing everything right, but my brain has just decided that 3 AM is the end of the night.

1pumygw,Lifestyle changes helped my sleep return,"For most of my life, sleep felt like something that just happened to other people. I could be exhausted all day, but the moment my head hit the pillow, my brain would wake up and start running marathons. I blamed stress, work, my personality, even genetics. Honestly, I thought I was just “not built” to sleep well.

At some point, I realized I had built an entire lifestyle that quietly worked against sleep. Too much pressure, too little rest, always pushing, always thinking. Even when I tried to relax, my nervous system didn’t know how anymore. I could lie in bed for hours, body tired, mind alert, replaying conversations, planning tomorrow, worrying about things that didn’t even matter.

The first change wasn’t dramatic. I stopped trying to force sleep. Instead of chasing sleeping pills or quick fixes, I started paying attention to my daily habits. I fixed small things: eating more regularly, getting a bit of sunlight in the morning, and slowing down in the evening instead of scrolling on my phone until midnight.

That’s also when I started supporting my body more intentionally. Long-term stress had clearly taken a toll. I began supplementing magnesium, starting with a higher dose around 500 mg per day. Over time, as my sleep stabilized, I reduced it to a maintenance dose. I chose FineMagTotal because it combines seven forms of magnesium, and I noticed the calming effect faster than with anything I’d tried before. I also added iron and calcium-rich colostrum, focusing on rebuilding instead of just sedating myself.

Sleep didn’t come back overnight. But little by little, something shifted. My thoughts slowed down. My body learned how to relax again. I started sleeping deeper, waking up less during the night, and most importantly, waking up without that heavy, anxious feeling in my chest.

What surprised me most was how these changes affected my day life. I handled stress better. Crowds didn’t overwhelm me anymore. Even on difficult days, I knew my body could recover at night. Now, when life gets intense, I return to the basics: simple routines, magnesium, and respecting my limits.

Looking back, it wasn’t one miracle solution. It was a series of small lifestyle changes that taught my body how to feel safe enough to sleep again. And once sleep returned, everything else slowly fell back into place.",1766581556.0,8,8,insomnia,sleep

Turns out that was making everything worse. The mental math just stressed me out more and turned sleep into this thing I had to optimize instead of something that just happens naturally.

Now I try not to look at the time when I'm getting into bed, especially after staying up late. And if I wake up early, I resist the urge to check how much longer I can sleep. It's honestly made a huge difference - less anxiety about not getting enough sleep, and I actually sleep better overall.

   Once every two months I have so be on call for a week. I usually only get one or no after hours calls during my week. I have never had a call late or in the middle of the night, but there is always a possibility. The nights I’m on call I usually use melatonin and nothing else. I’m a trade worker so the job isn’t that critical but I do need to be able to drive if a call comes in. 

   My insomnia is very anxiety related, and unfortunately I get very anxious when I’m on call and it translates to not being able to sleep. I miss more days of work due to this than anything else. Often it’s the worry about not being able to sleep that makes me not be able to sleep

   Are there any sleep or anxiety meds that can be used short term that won’t cause severe impairment? I have read about Trazodone being used a sleep aid and an anti depressant. Is this something that can be used short term, like a week at a time? I’m assuming as an antidepressant it can be taken during the day and therefore doesn’t cause a severe impairment? 

    It would be extremely unlikely to get a call late at night. I wouldn’t be expected to leap out of bed and respond. I could take a bit of time to wake up, have some coffee and get out the door within an hour.

Last night I had a hard time sleeping so I took 3.5 mg of zopiclone, which after 45 min I figure wasn’t working as I was still wired and anxious. Took the other half and passed out within 30 min. 

Is it possible to be so anxious that it causes 1 or more days of sleeplessness?

1ptw220,Need something to stop my overthinking,"I’m not exactly sure when my insomnia started but I think it was sometime during the pandemic and it’s been sticking around ever since. I’ve tried all the usual reset tricks like staying up almost 24 hours to fix my sleep schedule but nothing really worked.  
  
Most nights I get into bed before midnight but I don’t actually fall asleep until 3 or 4 am. My brain just won’t shut off, I get this wave of anxiety and overthinking and suddenly I’m wide awake. The worst part is I still have to get up at 7 am for work so I spend the day exhausted and feeling like I could fall asleep at any second. Then as soon as I get home it’s like my body flips a switch and I’m alert again.  
  
I’m starting to feel stuck and frustrated so I’m curious what’s actually helped others supplements, routines, mindset shifts anything. I’m not expecting a miracle just something that helped calm the mind enough to sleep.",1766502079.0,184,78,insomnia,sleep

1ptsvy3,"anyone else feel mostly fine despite low sleep, then BAM your brain ""suddenly notices"" you didnt sleep and you crash mid-day?","Title basically

So I'm getting ready/bracing myself for slogging thru yet another low-sleep day, only slept like 4.2 hours and couldn't get back to sleep (and believe me I tried, was laying there for like 1 hour 10 mins looking at the ceiling 🤦‍♂️) so I'm just up now

Anyways, what I mean by the title is on days like this one a peculiar phenomenon I notice is that I don't even feel sleepy or fatigued RIGHT AWAY. ***Right now*** I feel perfectly fine and my energy level seems stable... but it seems like at some point in the day my brain ""suddenly realizes"" I didn't sleep and my energy level crashes almost instantly 😂

Typically the timeline will follow like this:

\- I wake up ""early"" or ""unexpectedly"", missing a decent chunk of sleep (usually 3-4 hours)

\- the first couple hours of uptime seem fine energy-wise

\- at a random point midday my brain ""suddenly notices"" that I didn't sleep enough and seemingly in an instant my energy level absolutely crashes

\- ...the energy level stays low/sleepy for the remainder of the day

Sometimes this ""noticing"" crash happens at like 9 AM, sometimes it happens around 11:30 AM, sometimes it happens around 2 PM, doesn't seem to have a pattern - just at some point in the middle of the day

Anyways, I was wondering if anyone else experiences this phenomenon where your energy level is mostly fine despite insomnia and then the sleepiness ""SUDDENLY hits you"" at some point midday",1766493403.0,2,2,insomnia,sleep
1ptsvja,Sleep med journey to what works for me.,"Just sharing my personal experience with sleep meds.

For context - I’m 40/m/180 lbs

I’ve tried literally everything for sleep. Some work for a while and stop.

Ambien doesn’t do anything to me, doesn’t even make me “high” or have anxiolytic effects.

Sonata will get me to sleep but I’ll be up 2-3 hours later wide awake.

Hydroxyzine (pretty much any antihistamine) - will sleep but it’s not restful and feel terrible the next day.

Never tried trazodone as I’m already on other antidepressants so didn’t feel comfortable with it.

Quviviq, Dayvigo, and Belsomra didn’t do anything at all but make me irritated.

Melatonin works sometimes but it makes me feel bad the next day with headaches.

Lyrica and Gabapentin give me lots of energy and focus, which is good but not for sleep.

Benzos work of course- Xanax and Klonopin but I don’t want to take those every day or night.

Lunesta will give me  6-8 hours of restful sleep with no grogginess the next day.  No frills, no side effects. I personally don’t get the metal taste.

1ptso1g,Any tips to support others with insomnia?,"I used to have insomnia, but fortunately I managed to remedy it for quite a while now, a combination of white noise from a fan and the occasional melatonin pill for those rougher that normal nights is an absolute necessity for me but hey it works and its better than nothing!

However my gf has trouble sleeping too and it's much worse than my insomnia ever was, this is next level that no amount of white noise can fix. She cant sleep till atleast 1 - 3 am at best, no earlier, every night.

Im trying the best I can to support her through this, but I figured that emotional support from texting can only go so far. She would constantly try to wake me up so I can talk to her very late at night because she is feeling sleepless.

I tried to give her advice, nothing is working, im not competent enough to help in this. And I'm feeling that its starting to take a toll on me too, the constant waking up in the middle of the night, with my phone blaring blue light at me, even im starting to get sleeping problems again, I am typing this at 1:17am right now as I speak

I don't think its healthy going on like this for much longer, something needs to change but I dont know how. I really need advice on this (or atleast some information so i can better understand this, maybe she simply has a naturally late circadian rhythm?) because I literally don't know what to do, we've tried white noise and melatonin gummies which are quite frankly the only two things I know.

I asked the pharmacist if I could just take Zopiclone the night after Quiviviq and he said it was fine, but I'm concerned that's not correct.

  
My gp hasn't given me any advice (and won't speak to me without making an appointment which will be weeks away). She just said to take the Zopiclone if Quiviviq didn't work.. Well, it's well unto week 3 of Quiviviq and my REM sleep has been getting less and less. 'Sleep' is mostly light naps of and on..

I know this from personal experience. I recently won my battle with insomnia, at least for now, and I want to help others.

What helped me the most was reading the book Hello Sleep by Dr. Jade Wu. The most important insight was learning the difference between being tired and being sleepy. You do not fall asleep because you are tired. You fall asleep only when you are sleepy.

If you are tired but not sleepy, do not force yourself to sleep. Stay in bed or somewhere close to it and watch a favorite show or read a book until sleepiness actually appears. If you have a panic attack while trying to sleep, stop trying. Get up, watch something, or read until you calm down and feel sleepy again.

Go to therapy. Not CBT-I. Everything you need to know about CBT-I is already explained in this book, and you do not need to pay a therapist a lot of money to apply those techniques. What helped me more was regular therapy, where you work on the underlying issues causing the insomnia. There is no such thing as insomnia without an underlying cause.

Also, get your blood tested. Check thyroid hormone levels, magnesium, and potassium to rule out medical issues.

1ptiugc,Anxiety related sleep problems,"(26, M). About a month ago, I had a bad sinus infection with a massive migraine that caused me to have trouble sleeping for 2 days, taking hours to fall asleep. Once the sinus infection passed, I feel like because I struggled to sleep with the sinus infection for a few days, my body resembled sleep with pain/struggle/frustration, I’ll be fine all day but the second I lay down to sleep my chest tenses, I feel anxious in my chest, and my heart will race/beat hard, I could not sleep at all for 2-3 days. I went into work and got sent to the ER. ER said take melatonin and that was it. 

Saw my PCP, she did bloodwork and it came back normal. she said “sounds like anxiety” and prescribed me hydroxyzine. Hydroxyzine seems to help but I don’t want to have to take medication to sleep, haven’t needed it in 26 years. I feel like the sinus infection put my body into a bad anxiety sleep cycle that I need help breaking. None of the breathing techniques help, it makes the heart racing /heart pounding worse for me.

1ptel3j,Silent reflux and insomnia link,"Insomnia and silent reflux (LPR) are very often two sides of the same dysregulated system. One keeps the brain awake; the other keeps the vagus nerve irritated. Together they form a self-reinforcing loop that standard sleep advice usually fails to break.

No medication could put me to sleep. Nothing. I tried everything. Literally! Not even at the hospital.

But a cheap over the counter remedy against reflux was a turning point for me. I had 1-2 hours more sleep within days after taking this. Today I sleep like a baby - no meds whatsoever.

Highly recommend looking into silent reflux if you have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. I found out by coincidence- a neurosurgeon suggested it after a brain scan.
She had the same problem herself.

I didn’t have traditional signs of LPR but the meds had positive effect on my sleep instantly.

I had very mild physiological withdrawals, but what started developing after was far worse. My doctor says that it couldn't be from the medicine because it has a half-life, and that my symptoms are just “coming back”. I started to get very sad about things, including the grief of leaving my girlfriend (if it ever happens). It snowballed into an existential crisis (my family passing away, me passing away, where do we go after this?) I was living in constant dread and fear; it was all my mind kept thinking about. I would search for answers about those things, and at times it kept me up; if I went to sleep, I would wake up crying from sorrow because sleeping felt close to that experience. My sleep schedule was all over the place. But fast forward to about a week or two, I started not being able sleep at all. Drifting off was very, very difficult. If I went to sleep, it was probably for about an hour or two, where I would wake up in frustration and/or fear.
I did feel tired, but I couldn't get myself to sleep. I started stressing out and would get full-blown anxiety attacks throughout the day, which made me want to see if something was wrong in my body. I would look up/check my Oura ring data online, and it was making me panic even more. I would tell myself, “This can't be good for my body. How is my body going to handle this?” Needless to say, last week I went back on a 20mg dose of prozac and was also prescribed trazodone. However, my Oura ring tells me different. I still wake up through the night, and I don't know if the sleep is deep enough. I'm afraid I'm not resting my body enough for it to recover. I really don't know what to do right now.

Looking for a reality check / next steps (RDI/RERAs/flow limitation vs hyperarousal),"[Faire de la publicité sur reddit](https://ads.reddit.com/register?utm_source=web3x_consumer&utm_name=nav_cta)

Hi everyone,  
Posting anonymously because I’m kinda stuck and would love a reality check from people who’ve dealt with UARS / low-AHI fragmentation / CPAP data.

TL;DR: I fall asleep fine, but I wake up almost every night after \~5–6 hours and then I’m either fully awake or stuck in a “half-awake brain-on” state. I have mixed sleep study results (mild–moderate + positional apnea on one PSG, milder on another, “negative” PG but with suspected arousal/flow limitation). I’m trialing a ResMed AirSense 11 (AutoSet) and my OSCAR looks “good” on paper (low AHI, minimal leaks), but the 5–6h wall persists. I’m trying to figure out: is this subtle respiration (UARS / flow limitation / REM / position) OR mainly hyperarousal/conditioned insomnia OR a mix?  
I’m attaching screenshots of PSG summaries + OSCAR charts.

# Background (why I think hyperarousal might be part of it)

About a year and a half ago I had a bad drug experience (festival bad trip) followed by a trip to kenya where I took anti-malaria drugs (malarone) that messed up my mood and sleep very badly. After that I went into a state of anxiety/hypervigilance and that’s when the sleep fragmentation started.  
I do have an anxiety/OCD background (mostly mental compulsions). I’ve tried therapy (CBT-ish / psychoanalytic). I attempted CBT-I sleep restriction for \~3 weeks but I stopped because it was too exhausting at that time.

As of today, I've reduced stress to almost zero and am stable with OCD, I have tried everything I can to regulate my sleep environment, to see if my blood tests are ok (they are). That's why I believe either UARS or conditioned insomnia are my hopthesis.

So I’m trying to be very strict about: what’s objectively in the data vs what’s speculation/over-analyzing.

# My core symptom (very reproducible)

* No problem falling asleep at initial bedtime.
* Wake up after \~5–6 hours almost every night.
* “Brain ON”, body tired.
* If I’m on CPAP, I often remove the mask not long after waking (sometimes immediately, sometimes later).
* I don’t feel like I’m waking from choking — it’s more like a switch flips.

# Sleep studies (summaries)

I’ve had 2 PSGs + 1 home respiratory polygraphy (PG). I made an anonymized album with the key metrics from 2 PSG + 1 home PG + a comparison table.

# PSG #1 (older) — I took cyamemazine (not mentioned in report)

Important caveat: I took cyamemazine that night (to force continuous sleep), but it’s not written in the report.

* Report showed apnea + lots of micro-arousals.
* I also know that sedative might distort architecture / arousal scoring (or even worsen collapse).

# PG (respiratory polygraphy) — almost no AHI but physician said micro-arousals ~15/h

* AHI was low / no significant apnea.
* But the doctor told me there were signs consistent with frequent micro-arousals (even without full EEG).
* This is part of why UARS came up.

# PSG #2 (recent)

I had a long awake period mid-night (probably partly due to the equipment/cables), but still:

* I want to extract whatever is solid: respiratory indices, position, desats, arousals.
* low AHI of 7/h but 19 micro arousals/h with very low deep sleep

\[Key PSG/PG metrics (anonymized)

PSG#1 (Apr 2025, sedative): TST 7h48, SE 86%, AHI 16 (supine 30), ArI 28/h, resp-arousals 15/h, SpO2 nadir 90, T<90 0%

PG (Oct 2025): AHI 1, flow-lim 5/h, “events+reductions” 15/h, SpO2 nadir 91, T<90 0%

* Min 8-8.6 / Max 12 cmH2O
* EPR 3 full time

My OSCAR nights often look like:

* AHI low (sometimes mostly CA early in the night)
* Leaks very low
* Pressure stable-ish But I still wake around 5:30-ish (same “5–6h wall”) or when i take it off after 4h or so

Question about flow limitation: I sometimes see small flow-limitation bars \~10–20 minutes before I open my eyes, but it’s not always a clear cluster. How much weight would you give that? “Wake junk” vs real UARS signal?

# What I’m trying to figure out

# 1) Does this pattern scream UARS / flow limitation / RERAs to you?

# 2) Or does it look more like conditioned sleep-maintenance insomnia / hyperarousal?

If so, would you still keep CPAP if PSG shows mild positional apnea / arousal indices?

# 3) CPAP settings reality check

Given low AHI + minimal leaks but persistent early waking, would you:

* keep settings stable and focus on adaptation + CBT-I?

# 4) Treatment plan my sleep doc suggested

The sleep psychiatrist who reviewed the recent PSG said she didn’t see strong apnea signals that explain the insomnia, and recommended:

* 6 weeks of sleep restriction / CBT-I style
* with low-dose doxepin (5 mg nightly) or daridorexant if doxepin isn’t tolerated Curious if anyone here has had similar “mild apnea + big fragmentation” and whether that approach helped.

No I’m not talking about insomnia with 2-3 hours of sleep a night, I’m talking about no sleep at all for many weeks in a row. Friends lost, memories lost, time lost as a result.

I did journal and document what worked though. 4 and 5 being what moved the needle the most:

1. Stopped taking drugs for sleeping (tried trazodone and melatonin and many others) and supplements (you name it I probably tried it: Qualia, CBD, AGZ etc) except for ZMA.

2. No alcohol or caffeine
 
3. Stopped stressing about not sleeping

4. Hiking 8+ miles in nature on weekends

5. Only going to bed when I’m tired and have been reading or listening to an audio book—usually 2AM or later. CBTi is tough, but it’s the military supported method for insomnia treatment for a reason…

mayhaps if i make myself throw up would it make me fine🤨🫡

The days before i was sleeping just fine. And also on this weekend i was sleeping really really good although i went to bed at really unusual hours which normally wont work for me. 

But now im laying in bed awake(feeling drousy and all that) and cant really sleep. I was also always able to fall asleep with tik tok running next to me but now i fall alseep(when tik tok is on) and wake up instantly and my heart feels like my heart feels like it fell into my pants yk what i mean. Its like when you fall from a cliff in a dream. So now i can only sleep with my phone turned of 90% of the time. 

And the problem i have now is, that i have like a bit of anxiety about diseases(talking bout sFI or what this guy oliver alvis has) that i know i dont have or wont ever have. But its just my brain giving me this thoughts ""what if"" and so on and so forth. But thats only sometimes. I have phases with more anxiety and with less. 80% or more im able to sleep just fine.

Today again the same. I was falling asleep with my phone on woke up, put my phone to rhe side and tried sleeping. But then my heart stsrted to race because i didnt fall asleep immediately and now im wide awake again. It normally still takes like 10-30 mins or so to fall asleep (i think). And this is really annoying bacause its fucking up my school life, so to say. Either i go to school almost passing out and not being able to function properly in class ot i stay at home and miss my classes wich i also dont want. I mean its not often but still very annoying and i know i probably wont sleep tonight.

So i wanted to ask about any tips or tricks from you guys or yk just to tslk a bit cause reding the post on this forum ig has calmed me often and its noe like a bit of a ritual for when i cant sleep.

The frustrating part is that when I get good *natural* sleep, I feel much better overall. Zopiclone guarantees sleep, but it doesn’t feel the same. It’s almost like I’ve developed a psychological dependence on it, which I really don’t like.

I honestly wish I’d never touched it, but I was in a very bad place for four years and didn’t see another option at the time. Now my biggest fear is it stopping working.

1psjd35,Switching from mirtazapine for sleep trazodone vs doxepin? Also considering ramelteon,"Hi all. I’m looking for experiences (not medical advice) from people who’ve dealt with chronic insomnia, especially difficulty staying asleep. Insomnia runs in my family, and for a while mirtazapine 15 mg helped my sleep, but it’s basically stopped working for that purpose. Melatonin no longer helps either. Falling asleep isn’t my main issue — it’s frequent awakenings and early morning wake-ups.

I’m thinking about switching antidepressants primarily to help with sleep and have been reading about trazodone versus low-dose doxepin. I’ve also looked into ramelteon as a non-sedating option, but I’m leaning toward trying a different antidepressant first. I’m specifically trying to avoid benzodiazepines and Z-drugs like Ambien or Lunesta, and I’m hoping to find something that’s better for sleep maintenance rather than just sleep onset.

I’m currently on sertraline and am considering switching to Lexapro (escitalopram), so I’m especially interested in options that are generally considered safe to use alongside SSRIs like that. If you’ve tried trazodone, low-dose doxepin (Silenor or generic), ramelteon, or if you’ve switched off mirtazapine after it stopped working for sleep, I’d really appreciate hearing what helped or didn’t help. I’m particularly interested in experiences with sleep continuity, next-day grogginess, side effects, or tolerance over time.

1psj1hq,I've been suffering from Post-Viral Insomnia for over a week. Will it go away?,"Okay, so in the beginning of December 2025, I developed a terrible cold. It progressed into constant coughing, pink eye (eyelid inflammation, redness, discharge), and deep congestion. The pink eye went away after a few days, and the coughing and congestion decreased significantly after the second week. I used to cough up yellow phlegm but not anymore.

During the third week, I've been dealing with what I believe is post-viral insomnia, along with no appetite or libido. I have not been able to get to sleep at all. I don't even have much of a cough at night or anything like that. I just cannot fall asleep, even when my body feels tired. I've tried taking melatonin, hydroxyzine, magnesium supplements, and even CBD gummies. Nothing works.

I notice there are some nights where I'll drift in and out of sleep for a few minutes at a time, but it is never stable. That is after lying in bed for several hours awake. And if I do fall asleep, it never lasts very long. I'm just in deep rest where I'm still conscious. ChatGPT calls this ""sleep fragmentation"" due to post-nasal drip causing my central nervous system to remain on high alert. 

I keep hearing that it could take a few weeks to a few months to go away. For now, I cannot exercise because I'm afraid I'll put too much stress on my body if I cannot get a good night's sleep afterward. My appetite is a little better after the third week but not great.

I’ve taken Nyquil (I was also sick), Benadryl, and now got prescribed Mirtazapine but I doubt anything will work. My insomnia got bad around a month ago, it’s weakened my immune system to the point of getting back to back illnesses and having to miss lots of school and work. I don’t even feel tired which seems impossible because I’m not sleeping. 

I’m so scared this is FFI through a De Novo mutation (no one else in the family having it). I’ve done a lot of research today and I know SFI has other symptoms that start before insomnia and FFI is genetic, but you can get FFI without other family members having it through a mutation, which not a lot of people seem to know. I know how rare it is but it’s not impossible. The earliest phase of FFI is just insomnia with no other cognitive issues and that’s what’s happening to me.

I'm 20 years old and I tend to sleep only six hours or so. This has recently worsened. I found myself waking up in the middle of the night, as well as having a hypnic jerk while trying to fall asleep on 3 separate occasions. This has worsened until one night I was only able to sleep in less than an hour bursts, during which I had very abstract and fuzzy dreams. I have also began to experience symptoms of FFI, including:




-Muscle twitches. I have very short and subtle ones through the body, but most often in the legs. I have felt these previously, but only on rare occasions.

-Hypnic Jerks. As mentioned, I have experienced 3 this week. I used to only have them once a month or so.

-Muscle tension. I sometimes wake up with my muscles feeling like I am about to have a seizure. I never had one, though.

-Insomnia. Obviously, I find it harder and harder yo fall asleep since around a month ago.

-I get random burst of nusea and vertigo through the day.

-My anxiety is through the roof at most times of the day.

-I have crazy hypertension

-My family is German in origin, aka the ethnicity with the most cases of FFI.

-Lost most of my appetite. I am usually borderline bulimia.

-Feel an incredible sense of fatigue throught most of the day.

-Melatonin did not fix my sleep issues. 

-I find focusing on stuff slightly harder.

-My long distance vision has gotten worse over the last few months. 




Now, here are a few things that might suggest I DON'T have it:




-I have been to the hospital recently for weird headaches/head tension. I had CT scans and EEG done. CT scans showed zero abnormalities, still waiting for EEG results. 

-The muscle twitching seems to go away when I do not think about it or am moving my body

-I am a hypochondriac and regulary get scared I have rabies or something like that.

-Hydroxyzine helped me a bit and made mem feel very tired

-My heart rate is normal and my usual diet has a lot of salt, which would explain the hypertension

-I regularly check my knowledge and memeory to see if I do not have dementia. I have not failed a single of these tests yet.

-Neither my father (german side of the family), nor his grandmother, nor his grandfather nor his parents etc had it.

-The vertigo and nusea get better the moment I stop focusing on them

-My libido is normal

-I always had very weird hypnagogic hallucinations when I started falling asleep.

-I was able to sleep for a total of 4 hours a night, with two interruptions, after the incident where I only slept in extremely short bursts

-I still snore regulary and fell back asleep in the morning without me even knowing. 

-While at rhe jospital, I was given a stronger sedative (forgot its name) and it did knock me out

-I feel a weird pressure in my upper jaw sometimes. Idk what to make of this but that def is not a FFI symptom

so a lot of the time now, I feel very overwhelmed & lost with daily life. Apart from my job which is easy anyway, I struggle to really be able to do much, & it seems to play on my mind more now than it ever did. 

I can't do DIY, I don't have any particular skills & basically just feel very ""lost"" a lot.

1pry1lr,My friend said I have victim complex/mentality when haven’t been sleeping due to this issue,"I told her this situation and she said I’m playing victim and that I need to take action which I get but also feel and and embarrassed about bringing it up: 

TW

We were together for five years. There were good times, I guess, but there were also so many times I was genuinely scared of him. Times when I felt completely powerless and alone. Things would be fine and then something horrible would happen, and afterwards he’d act like nothing ever happened. I started questioning if I was remembering things right, if I was losing my mind.

I’ve been avoiding saying this, but I think the relationship was abusive. And now I’m in this awful place where I feel torn apart inside. I don’t want to destroy his life - he has nothing. No money, nowhere stable to live, serious mental health problems. But what he did to me was horrible. I can’t just pretend it didn’t happen.

His family either ignores what he does or makes excuses for him. When I try to talk about it, they make me feel like I’m crazy - not just him, but them too. It makes me doubt everything.

Here’s what I know happened:

One time I was crying and he slapped me across the face. The more I cried, the angrier he got.

He pushed me into a towel rack and dented it because I accidentally tossed his pants and they hit his face.

He tried to force me to drink shroom tea. When I said no, he kept shoving it at me until it spilled everywhere, then he slapped me and called me a stupid bitch. Said I was the problem.

He got drunk and stormed into my apartment screaming that I abandoned him. He threw my stuff around, ripped my shirt off me, and held me down. My roommate had to physically kick him out.

The first time he grabbed my throat, I was half-naked. I had to do a Zoom meeting after with a scratchy voice. When I brought it up later, he said it was sexual and that I was exaggerating.

He wouldn’t drive me to work unless we had sex first. If I cried or was running late, he’d threaten to just leave me there.

During sex, when he got frustrated or couldn’t get hard, he’d pinch me hard, pull my hair, and call me names. He’d accuse me of cheating or being a bitch.

Once he climbed on top of me and hit me in the head multiple times because I accidentally hit his eye with his pants.

He drove like a maniac, pulling my hair and saying we were both going to die because I talked about leaving him. I had a complete panic attack.

He choked me. Multiple times. Not for long, but long enough to scare the hell out of me.

He wouldn’t let me go to the bathroom during sex. Even when I was crying, he wouldn’t let me stop.

His cousin heard me crying during a fight and came in to check. He got even more pissed and blamed me for letting someone see me like that.

When his brother was staying in the same room, he made me have sex with him in the bathroom. I felt so humiliated but didn’t know how to say no.

He used to “check” me to see if I’d been with other guys, while he was out there cheating on me.

He bit my face when he was angry and held me down, poking me in the chest while I cried.

I think early in our relationship he did something sexual to me when I was half-asleep after getting high. It’s fuzzy but it still haunts me.

If I said something hurt or that I wanted to stop during sex, he’d laugh at me, say I was lying, or just keep going.

He called me a cheater for wanting to hang out with friends or family. Meanwhile he was the one lying and cheating.

I hate admitting this, but sometimes I just gave in to sex because I was scared of what would happen if I said no. I’d cry during it or after and feel like my body wasn’t mine anymore. Sometimes he wouldn’t let me get dressed or made me stay in positions until he was done with whatever he was doing.

One time the neighbors heard me crying and him screaming. He was throwing things, yelling threats through the wall, saying he’d kill them. Later he blamed me for the whole thing.

So why do I still feel so confused about everything?

He’s been through trauma. He has mental health issues. Part of me still wants him to be okay. But none of that makes what he did okay.

Is this actually abuse? Is it sexual assault if I was crying, saying I didn’t want to keep going, and he wouldn’t let me stop?

I feel like I’m losing my mind trying to understand it all. And I still feel guilty. I can’t make myself report anything - he’s already lost everything. He’s homeless because I left him.

1pru2vs,Withdrawal as a cause for occasional bad nights.,"After learning some not so great things about aspartame one morning I decided to quit my consumption cold turkey. Even if the things that aspartame can potentially do weren't happening to me I didn't see harm in cutting it out. I had been consuming the equivalent of 3 to 4 8 oz drinks daily from decaf iced tea mix and didn't think it would be a big deal. 

My withdrawal symptoms. That night I reached 24 hours without I had a very difficult time falling asleep. I am usually in bed between 9-10 and sleep within half an hour. This night I might have slept a short spelll between 1 and 2 but can't be certain I actually fell asleep and was only certainly asleep atl 3 and got maybe 2.5 hours all night. The next day I had crazy mood swings and obsessive thoughts that may have been caused by the lack of sleep, withdrawal, or both. After 60 hours I'm back to normal.  

It occurred to me that while I had a strong habit of consuming the iced tea with aspartame it was not something I needed to have and probably have had days without it here and there throughout the year. If I went a day without it, that wouldn't seem noteworthy to me. I also typically sleep great but have the occasional inexplicable evening where I will be up all night and get from 0-3 hours.  It may be that those nights were caused by aspartame withdrawal but since I hadn't taken note of the withdrawal the cause was mysterious. Now I know the most likely cause. 

If you have intermittent insomnia like that it might br helpful to keep a detailed consumption log because in sure there are other substances in foods that can cause withdrawal and bring about insomnia.

1prnhdx,Insomnia bad again... please help!,"I am at the end of my rope. What can I do to fix my sleep schedule before spring semester??
*(Apologies for the long-winded post, TL;DR at the bottom.)* 

Hi all, F(19) full time college student here with a part-time job. For context: I have POTS (flares up from lack of sleep) I struggle with periodic insomnia, have been for my whole life. It waxes and wanes with intensity but for most of high school, I got it under control. I had a great schedule, going to bed at 8:30 (10:30 pm latest) and waking up at 5 every day for morning classes. (Also take ~50 mg of Unisom to help me sleep) 
Well— college rolls around, I get a big girl office job all while having raging (undiagnosed) ADHD. I manage okay, going to sleep a bit later, 10:30 ish and waking up at 6 but still pretty reasonable. Here is where the problem started:

I took a gap semester before college due to external circumstances and joined in Spring instead of fall like everyone else. Due to AP credits I wasn't behind everyone, but I wanted to be ahead so I took summer classes. (For those unfamiliar: summer courses at my college are broken up into months, and you learn ≈18 weeks worth of material in one month) l ended up taking a particularly difficult course (gen chem 1) with a professor that told us, we either drop everything outside of the class or we get failed by him... point blank. For this entire month (pre-medicated), due to the copious amounts of coursework and studying, I essentially sleep-tortured myself into sleeping ≈2 hours a night for that WHOLE month. Going to bed at 4, waking up at 6 for classes. 

I get some reprieve as we had a 6 week long break before regular fall sem started up again. During that time, I got some insurance and got on ADHD meds (20 mg Vyvanse and then worked up to 30 mg in Sept). It helped a LOT, as I was consistently going to the gym after work, getting the medication energy out and finally started getting SOME WHAT back to normal, as I wasn't ""procrastinating"" my sleep anymore due to prior habits. (Sleeping at ≈11-7 for work) Yay!

Fall semester hits. I'm taking 17 (max 18) credit hours due to a scholarship req, and basically overloading myself AGAIN! Taking gen chem 2 (another nightmare) and back to square one again with my sleep & poor health. Now arguably WORSE because instead of enduring sleep torture for ONE month, it lasted from Aug-Dec. Exams ended almost 2 weeks ago and I thought, "" let me fix things since I'm no longer stressing about schoolwork at night, I can just go to sleep and wake up for work."" WRONG.

....The way my sleep schedule has been going, it's like school NEVER ended. On weeknights, I am getting 5 hours MAX of sleep. I am genuinely at my wit's end here. My POTS flare up has been the worst it's been, & school starts back up in the second week of January.  I am only taking 4 classes this time, but 2/4 are eco/evo biology, and 8 AM organic chemistry classes 4x a week. I am planning on adjusting work-life balance, but I really want to be able to get SLEEP under control so I don't absolutely collapse in spring. Thank you!

I've dealt with chronic insomnia for over a decade (diagnosed around age 25 after years of thinking I was just ""bad at sleeping""). Everyone – family, friends, doctors, random people online – kept giving me the same useless crap: ""Just relax"", ""Don't think about it"", ""Try to clear your mind"", ""Count sheep if you have to"". I believed it. I tried SO hard. I'd lie there forcing myself to ""relax"", which only made my brain scream louder. Hours turned into full nights of staring at the ceiling, heart racing, hating myself for not being able to ""just"" do something that everyone else seemed to manage effortlessly.

It felt like torture. I lost jobs because I'd show up exhausted, relationships suffered, and I started dreading bedtime like it was the enemy. The worst part? Every time I admitted I couldn't sleep, someone would hit me with ""Just relax, dude"". Like I hadn't tried that a thousand times already.

Then I found something that actually helped: a simple ""Sleep Reset Routine"" (white noise + progressive muscle relaxation in short bursts, plus strict sleep restriction – only going to bed when truly sleepy, even if it's 3am at first). No magic, but now I get 6-7 hours most nights, and on bad nights it's still way better than before.

The sweet revenge? When people now give me that ""just relax"" line, I hit them with: ""Yeah, I tried that for 10+ years and it made everything worse, but thanks!"" Then I watch their faces when they see I'm actually functioning. I just smile and say ""Guess it was all about willpower, right?"" 😏

It goes against every standard sleep tip out there (meditation apps, breathing exercises, ""progressive muscle relaxation"" – all that BS that backfires for overthinkers). Your nervous system isn't dumb; it senses the effort as a threat, dumps more cortisol, and keeps you wired. I've been there, judging every breath, feeling my heartbeat like a drum, hating myself for ""failing"" at something that's supposed to be easy.  

But here's the game-changer: I stopped trying to relax and started using tricks that interrupt the cycle without the performance anxiety. Stuff like physical resets (tense/release muscles to confuse your system), dumping thoughts on paper (no judging, just vomit it out), and giving your brain a boring neutral job (like visualizing random words or absurd stories). It's from this Anxiety Shutdown Kit – a 15-min protocol built for overthinkers who can't shut off.

I've suffered from insomnia for as long as I can recall. I once had prescribed medication for it, but it's been literal years and I no longer recall what's it called. In the past, I would regularly take Xanax, NyQuil, Zzquil, etc, to help me sleep, but always developed severe dependencies on it. 

I always thought supplemental melatonin was safe to take, but I've just found out that I'm taking a massive dose (10 mg) and I had no idea. I'm a student and I'm also working multiple jobs, so I often need sleep for these things and so I've been relying on it for the past year or so. I've only recently put two and two together to realize that melatonin hangovers are what often make me too tired to function most of the time. I also have the trademark headaches and nausea that often leads to me getting sick. 

I stopped taking it on Wednesday night, I think. I found myself unable to sleep before sunrise for the past few days and it's starting to make me panic. I have deep anxiety alongside an irrational fear that I'll never be able to sleep again. It's getting worse every night and no matter how much I try to wake myself up before it gets too late into the day, I'm still not tired at night. 

I don't know how to cope with this. I understand that taking too much external melatonin can mess up the production of internal melatonin and I'm starting to develop the irrational fear that my body WON'T start to make melatonin again. 

I'm considering getting a lower dose at the store later, 1-3 mgs to see if that helps. Does anyone out there have any advice or thoughts? Thanks so much all.",1766226811.0,2,2,insomnia,sleep

1pr96hk,Best latex mattress tips? Tried everything else already and need sleep!,"I’m almost at my wit’s end! I’ve tried so many things just to fix my sleep 😩😩😩 New pillows, different temps, different setups but NOTHING's working. So now I’m thinking about switching to a latex mattress and this might be my next and hopefully the last move.  
  
I wake up sweating even with the AC on that’s why I thought of going for latex than the regular materials. Latex also has a bit of bounce which can make it easier for me to move around. But I haven’t found “the one” just yet.  
  
Right now I’m looking at the Nolah Natural. Based on its product description, it uses organic latex and wool, and says it helps with temperature control. It costs way more but I’m fine with it if it truly works. Has anyone here tried the Nolah Natural? My insomnia has been rough and I just want to sleep again.

1pr939t,"Diagnosed with RBD, RLS, and PLMD","Hey guys! I've been diagnosed with all three and have tried cognitive behavior therapy, doxepin, gabapentin, melatonin, and another medication used for RLS. I don't think they're working as most nights I'll wake up to lifting my arms up over my head, out in front of me, talking, etc. last night I actually woke up (and slightly remember the dream) because I was physically out of bed jumping up and down trying to wake myself up in my dream and from my dream. Other nights I simply can't sleep at all because I can't get comfy, and others I sleep but wake up annoyed or panicked from vivid dreams. I looked into this some and saw that medicines like pristiq and metropolol can cause these disorders.

I met with my psychiatrist today and we discussed my antidepressant (pristiq) being a possible contributer to my RBD. He told me he'd like to see me in a month after I've met with my sleep doctor next week. In the meantime he said he'd look into antidepressants that are not as likely to cause RBD. I'd like to do my part and have some ideas of what meds have worked for others if at all. Additonally, what kind of conversations, questions, concerns, etc should I have with my sleep doctor? Are there supplements y'all have used to help with any of these disorders? Thanks!

Sometimes silence was actually worse—my brain would just go full hamster wheel mode.

A few weeks ago, I started experimenting with sleep earbuds with ambient sound, not loud, not “blocking everything,” just a steady layer that sits there. rain-ish sounds, low hums, that kind of thing. The weird part is it didn’t knock me out instantly. What it did was stop the constant micro-wakeups. Like, I’d still wake briefly, but I didn’t fully come back to consciousness every time.

Also, and this surprised me, my anxiety around “I need to fall asleep NOW” kind of faded. it felt less like forcing sleep and more like letting my brain latch onto something boring and predictable.

1pqwq0o,I’m sleeping now but still have major sleep anxiety,"Hi all, hoping someone has an understand of what’s happening to me.

So long story short, last year i had a really bad bout with insomnia that lasted about 2 months. This was a really dark period in my life where all my waking thoughts were consumed around sleep. I was constantly anxious and worried, on sleep meds, sometimes drinking wine to sleep. However, I eventually started sleeping more bit by bit and stopped worrying and thinking about sleep.

Fast forward 1 year - I go on a trip late october 2025 and had trouble sleeping again for 3 nights straight. This caused a return of the “sleep anxiety.” All of November i had a mix of bad nights but mostly good nights where i was sleeping but still found myself worried about sleep all day. A couple weeks ago it got as bad as it did last year where I had a whole week of bad sleep but now it’s getting better again and sleep still isn’t out of my mind. I’m so confused because last year sleep started getting better and my anxiety linearly started decreasing. This time around it feels like my sleep is alright but my anxiety around sleep isn’t really going away?

I just want to be back to 100% again. I don’t feel fully functional because I still have this underlying fear that my insomnia will come back. Is it because my mind still has the trauma memory of last year and I haven’t really processed it yet? I don’t want to be like this forever and want to enjoy my life again. Distractions dont really help either. Is this just a huge fear unlearning curve that I’ll have to be patient about? it’s worth noting that I did get on SSRIs last year because of this, which did seem like it helped me massively because my anxiety went way down. But then I weaned off of it earlier this year.!I’m just so tired of living the past 2 months like this even though the initial insomnia is gone and I’m afraid I’m going to “think” myself back into insomnia again.

For years now, every night is the same nightmare: I get into bed tired, but the second my head hits the pillow my heart starts racing, thoughts spiral about work/tomorrow/life, and I'm wide awake for hours.

Nothing sticks.

The worst part? I KNOW it's anxiety, not a ""sleep problem"". My brain treats bedtime like a threat. And the more I try to ""fix"" it, the worse the pressure gets.

I'm not looking for more tips (please, no ""just relax"" or ""try chamomile""). I just need to know: has anyone here with severe sleep anxiety actually gotten to the point where they can sleep mostly normally again? Like, no more dread about bedtime?

1pqhp4o,Temazepam 15mg daily,"I’ve had insomnia for as long as I can remember (since 15yrs old). Over the years having one or two sleepless nights was a norm. I managed it somehow in the younger years of my life. However 40 onwards it became harder and harder to handle…. After continuously complaining to my gp and failure to get any relief from off-labels such as mirtazapine and quetiapine (both gave me test legs syndrome) my doctor has prescribed me 15 mg temazepam (10x10mg per week, staged dispense script)
And I’m sure he did that ‘short term’ as I recorded my sleep hours which were, on average, 2.7 hours per 24 hours for last 20 days.
He suggested going down the medication for restless leg. Which shows how uncomfortable he is with benzos.
Given I’ve had very swear insomnia lately, I begged him for benzos. So he agreed and gave me ‘few weeks’ of temazepam. (Until he is back from Christmas and new years)

Question, I completely understand the problems with benzos, but combatively, how bad is 2.7 hours sleep per 24 hrs for 20 days. This also includes 4 days and 4 nights (approx 100 hours) of continuous wakefulness ending with me literally passing out in the end. My gp says that Brian has the ability to go in micro sleeps without us noticing. So he wasn’t very concerned. So even if I accept that part, but being safe (I.e. not driving, staying home and only go for short walks ‘in safe zones’) and not being able to function on job? How do I deal with that? For now I’m between jobs, so I can be forced to deal with it… but what happens when I do get a job? I think that the health care professionals cannot understand the demands of corporate environment even if you tell them!

1pqgrlh,Insomnia journey,"Hello all, 
My first experience of insomnia was when I was a 13 years old and went to boarding school and I was bullied by older kids. I stopped sleeping well in the school environment and wound only sleep well when ever I went home. After the bullying stopped. I could not still not sleep well in school but would sleep well at home this went on for 5 years. For the last 10 years I have had good sleep but would have random difficulty falling asleep that would resolve after one night. I am 29 now but for the past 4 months I have had another bout of insomnia. It was triggered by some life stress which has long ended. When the insomnia started getting worse I decided to quit all drugs like weed, cigarettes, alcohol which I rarely used and my sleep got better then it suddenly got even worse. I went to my family doctor and got on some sleep meds (zoplicone) used it for about 5 days(3.5mg) and it worked reasonably well when i stopped sleep got slightly better.
One day when I was trying to sleep during the third month of the insomnia I suddenly started getting adrenaline rush and my ear drums would pulsate jolting me awake. It got to point where I did not sleep at all for 4 days. I went to the ER and was prescribed 50 mg trazodone which causes horrible side effects like hypnotic jerks, muscle spasm, hallucinations, intense depression just after 1 dose so I had stop it. I was prescribe some  diazepam for 3 days to help me deal with the after effects. After I noticed some improvements and began sleeping a few (4)  hours again. I am not on any meds at the moment. I fall asleep easily but keep getting woken up after 3 hours of sleep on most nights and struggle to go back to sleep. Most times when I try to go back to sleep I get a pulsating sound in my ears which prevents me from sleeping again. 4 days ago after being out for most of the day(in a very noisy environment) and feeling very tired I surprisingly got 10 hours of deep sleep. The next few nights the cycle has continued. 
I have sime other side effects now I am unmotivated, I have low impulse control, I am very emotional I cry a lot now. I cannot focus or concentrate for long. My self esteem has gone down. Speech is not as clear any more (now faster), i breath shallow now unconsciously. Slightly elevated blood pressure. Sad for most of day. 

Luckily for me my sister who works remotely has come live with me for a month. But I know I will need to be on my own soon. I dont know if I can continue on 3 hours or less of sleep every night. Right now I feel the biggest blocker to my sleep is the pulsating eardrums muscle that happen randomly when I try to fall back asleep after waking up.
Does any one have any advice or insigt on my situation ?

My family doctor has recommended a sleep study and a psych consultation but this would take a couple of months.

I’ve tried all the different ones and sleepbuds and I just need silence. It’s been an obstacle for me in so many ways, moving to new places etc. After a semester out of state that nearly killed me, I thought I’d get sleep before my surgery in my home state.

New neighbors moved in. Sure, it wasn’t as noisy as the place I had just come from but the neighbors run machinery at varying times throughout the night. I’ve talked to them and they deny anything besides a bathroom fan, which does wake me up, but I hear other things. I’ve tried every earplug on the market, even custom, and I just find them so incredibly difficult to sleep with. I’m amazed people can tune out the sound of a fan, it’s incredibly jarring to me. I’ve tried therapy, and a ton of meds, nothing has helped. 

I’ve had to sleep at my parents’ at age 29 and I still only slept one full night in the last two weeks. We got in a fight over noise and my mom just says I’m ruining her life even though my parents said they’d take care of me after surgery and it just sucks and they can stand a lot more noise than I can. The day before surgery I got 3 hours of sleep and I didn’t wanna stay at my parents’ anymore, but my place isn’t as quiet during the night. I keep trying earplugs and meds but it’s just so difficult and I feel displaced from my home and unstable.

I have chronic pain too and I was hoping the surgery would help. It’s a major surgery where I would be completely bedridden for some time and need around the clock care. It’s incredibly painful and intense, and I just decided that if I don’t have a calm, quiet place to sleep that I feel safe in, and I haven’t been getting any sleep, that it was best to postpone it. I know this wouldn’t be an issue for people with more friends or a partner or who don’t have sleeping or noise issues but it just feels so incredibly lonely to suffer like this and postpone something I’ve been needing for years.

The mental hospital after 4 nights of no sleep changed my life for the good. If you go days without sleeping it might be the best choice.,"27M I had an emergency appendectomy out of no where that started a downhill of effects after. I’m dealing with prostatitis, urethritis, and more. I’m also a veteran with PTSD, depression and anxiety. 

Anyways I’ve always dealt with sleep issues but in October I was met with my new worst fear and scariest enemy. (Health anxiety) mixed with insomnia.  I didn’t sleep for 4 days due to my body just not handling what happened mentally and all the medication I was on. I was met with frequent urination, pain, heart palpitations, you name it. I would close my eyes and boom immediately could feel every single heart beat leading into sheer panic and adrenaline dumps. Day after day went by and I didn’t sleep and didn’t sleep. It was the scariest moments of my life, nothing could prepare me for day 3 hearing noises and just being in a state of panic and not in my head. I convinced myself I had sleep apnea and was waking up panicking because my heart stopped. Crazy right? I called 911 on day 3 because I thought my heart stopped…. Obviously it didn’t but there was a bigger issue ahead of me. I was losing my mind. I was scared. I was so scared. All I read about was no one cares if you go to the ER, I was so scared I was going to never sleep again. 

My wife helped me and I called the veterans hotline and was hospitalized in the mental hospital.  The EMT and fire department showed up and was so nice and kind. I told them I was on the verge of hurting myself and losing it. Yes the 72 hour hospital isn’t the prettiest experience. Day one you’re gonna probably feel scared and like your crazy but guess what? Best sleep of my life that night. They gave me the good ole B250. Benadryl, Ativan and for me it was 50 mg of seraquil.  I stayed 3 days and slept like a literal baby because I was safe, I was monitored and I was calmed. Brought back into my mind realizing the entire time it was my mind running rampant and not the “loss ability to sleep”.  I’m 60 days already on 50mg of seraquil and have 0 symptoms except grogginess in the morning. It works. Very well.

1pq9o9e,Defeating Insomnia (no BS),"I know one strong method for beating insomnia (provided one isn’t dealing with any serious health issues or drug use, or drug use withdrawal). If you can’t sleep, you don’t, you just live your life in those sleepless hours. And those waking hours run into the next day. Eventually the prolonged hours without sleep catch up and one gets exhausted. 

The trick is to stay up until the next cycle of sleep, until your body is exhausted. One might say, “but this isn’t good for you.” Likely not, but neither are days of insomnia. The problem is solved by just staying up into exhaustion. This should eventually help with more of a regular schedule.

I don’t see any other choice: can’t sleep? Well, then you might as well stay up (and actually do something in that time of staying up). The part that gets difficult is when the exhaustion sets in, *but you still have to stay up so that you fall asleep at the right time.* That’s the trick.

Find yourself not being able to sleep again? Too bad, back to the staying up schedule. You will find that this works out to some days of great sleep, and some days of only a few hours, but overall, I think it actually defeats the insomnia— because it does result in quality sleep, eventually.

What does this look like in the life of an insomniac? It doesn’t look like a regular 8 hour sleep schedule, it looks like insomniacs have to operate by a different schedule. When their body won’t let them sleep, they just have to go with it and stay up, run forward into the next cycle.

This means, some days one will get no rest, other days one will only get a few hours, and other days, one will obtain to being well rested.

Lots of things can disturb sleep without a person knowing it. Note: this method might not be the method for everyone. Also, your diet greatly matters! ",1766111767.0,0,12,insomnia,sleep

What I usually do: put an ASMR video (dark screen) in my completely dark room. That seems to soothe my brain because it shushes all the thoughts inside it...but not tonight apparently.  
The ASMR was either too loud, not loud enough or too full of ads. I feel like throwing up tbh.

1pq48ul,Psychotic break.,"Last night I slept around 1am-3am. When I woke up my mom had informed me of what happened through the night. For reference I am a college student and am on winter break.

I had been on night 5 without sleep. Apparently at 10pm ish I went outside, irate, screaming at nothing but the sky for over an hour. She had to tackle me to force feed me my ambien which only works sometimes. Luckily it worked.

She said I had completely lost it, I scared the shit out of her. She said all she saw in me was pure rage, and I am not an angry person. I don’t remember any of it.

I woke up at 3 am confused but happy I was in bed. I had no memory of the past 2 ish days, usually my memory dips after day 2-3 no sleep. I played the sims for a bit. When my mom woke up she texted me to meet her when I wake up.

I went to talk to her confused. She explained everything and I wanted to cry. She said the past day I had been acting “extremely off putting” her words not mine, but that was the worst thing.

I don’t know what to do. There are two days missing from my memory and apparently the one I went batshit crazy. I’m at wits end. My mom had to take my keys last night too apparently as she was afraid I’d get an an accident, bless her soul.

Anyone with any advice on this, please. I need something to hang on to. I sleep 1-3 days out of the week. I can’t keep living like this.

1pq2jhn,how do I do this,"I hope you can be patient; I know many of you have struggled with this condition for years, maybe all your life. 

It’s the afternoon after my second night of no sleep at all. Since I got out of the hospital (bike crash, surgery) a good night has been 3-4 hours in 2-3 shifts. A bad night has just been me, staring across the room, until the sun comes up. 

I’m trying to get with a psychiatrist. My GP has tried me on hydroxyzine — I reacted \*very\* badly to it (that’s what started this two-day stretch, a night of hammering heart and hot flashes). Weed does something similar — CBD+THC was another zero-sleep night. 

I’m on propranolol for panic, and I’ve got 1mg of Ativan (although I took one last night and it didn’t do anything but make me feel a little relaxed). 

I’m going to work through all the stuff — the CBT-i app, whatever sleeping pills the psych will eventually give me. ACT therapy, if I can get it. Daniel Erichsen’s book. My GP has prescribed Lexapro for anxiety, so I’m gonna bite the bullet and try that too. 

My question is… how do you live? If it ends up taking months or years to resolve — how do you deal with the brain fog, the anhedonia, the loss of capacity?

1pq0hgr,Ambien and Sleepwalking,"I have pretty severe insomnia and genuinely cannot sleep without the specific sleep aid medications. I have Bipolar 1 and panic disorder so I take high doses of Seroquel, Clonazepam, and clonidine and even those alone can't get me to sleep. 

For almost a year I was taking Lunesta to treat my insomnia and it only worked for so long at it's highest dose so I decided to switch over and try ambien. I used to know someone who abused their prescription and knew about all it's whacky side effects, I just thought they only happened as a result of abuse or high doses. 

Since taking it I've been able to get better sleep than I ever had on the Lunesta, I just experience one of it's more severe side effects and it's been disruptive in my living situation. Every night an hour or so after taking my dose I ""blackout"" and make a sandwich.

Unlike other situations I've read about, I wouldn't consider my sleepwalking dangerous to myself or others: I could walk down a flight of stairs with no risk of falling; I can easily cut lettuce and tomato; I never wake up with bruises or random cuts—I simply make a sandwich and fall asleep—it's kinda funny. 

The only problem in my situation is the fact I'm loud and disruptive to those trying to sleep. I've talked to my psychiatrist and because I'm not actively putting myself or others in danger there's no real reason to stop taking it given how effective it is in treating my insomnia. 

Anyone who's been on the medication and have been able to work around something similar have any advice on how to somewhat prevent this? ",1766087792.0,2,2,insomnia,sleep

1ppfnkc,Moved abroad and my sleep is worse than ever,"I’ve recently moved to Chiang Mai, and I’m hoping for some advice because I’m honestly out of ideas at this point.

When we first arrived, we had short-term accommodation for one week. During that time, we were actively looking for somewhere to live longer-term, but options were extremely limited and we were running out of places to stay. This apartment ended up being our only realistic option, so we had to take it.

We viewed the place during the daytime (me and my dad), and while it’s obviously next to a highway, we genuinely didn’t realise just how loud it would be, especially at night. Unfortunately, we signed a 3-month lease before understanding the full extent of the noise.

Within 10 hours of moving in, it became clear that I couldn’t sleep here at all because of the traffic noise, and we immediately told the owner that we couldn’t stay. The owner refused any refund or early exit from the lease, so we’re now completely stuck here for the full 3 months and can’t afford to move elsewhere.

The first few nights here, I had no sleep at all. For sanity, we stayed somewhere else for a few nights, but that’s obviously not financially sustainable. I then tried melatonin, which worked for the first couple of nights (I slept really well), but it has completely stopped working and I’ve barely slept again for the past few nights.

I’ve tried custom-fitted earplugs, sleeping in the living room, and various sleep aids (including the sleep drinks from 7-Eleven), but nothing has helped. I also keep the air-con running constantly to try to mask the noise (it’s already quite loud), and I’ve tried ASMR / audio masking, but that hasn’t worked either. About a week in, the owner added an extra glass window layer in the bedroom, but the noise reduction was very minimal and it’s still extremely loud.

At this point, I’m really struggling with sleep and feel like I’m running out of options. Moving isn’t possible financially, and breaking the lease isn’t allowed.

If anyone has practical, experience-based advice for dealing with severe road noise in Chiang Mai — specific setups, products, noise masking methods, or anything that actually worked for you — I’d be incredibly grateful.",1766025555.0,1,2,insomnia,sleep

1ppc1ik,i sleep but i never feel rested,"hi everyone,  
my name is dalia, i am 20 years old, and i have been struggling with sleep problems for several years

i have read many posts here and i can see most people mainly struggle with falling asleep. in my case, that’s not really the issue. even though my sleep schedule is irregular and i tend to stay up later on my days off, i usually fall asleep without much trouble. the real problem is that i wake up multiple times during the night, often at similar hours every night, and i wake up feeling completely unrested. the last time i woke up actually feeling refreshed was almost six years ago and even then, it took a long time for that to happen

i live in a household where the people around me are quite loud and do not really try to be quieter, which could seem like an obvious cause of my sleep issues. however, even when i am completely alone at home, or when i travel to a calm, quiet place, i still do not sleep any better and wake up just as tired

when i was still going to school, i woke up tired every single day, and it led to suicidal thoughts. i kept wondering, “how do people live like this? how do they go to work and function every day?” it made me feel like something was fundamentally wrong with me, especially since it seems like even people who do not take care of themselves and use substances can still get a good night’s sleep at least once in a while

i am afraid that my sleep problems will ruin my life. i could already be studying at university, but i know i will not be able to handle it until i fully sort out my sleep. i cannot imagine going to university while waking up every morning with suicidal and hopeless thoughts caused by lack of sleep

despite waking up exhausted, i do not really have problems with concentration during the day, which still gives me some hope that things can improve. last year i went to a psychologist and was prescribed medication - not only sleeping pills, but also medication for anxiety and depressive symptoms. at that time i was doing very badly mentally. now i am doing a bit better, but my sleep is still bad. honestly, ever since i was around 11-12 years old, i have been an anxious, shy, and withdrawn person. i do not know if that’s connected to all of this, but i am also extremely physically tense. all of it is mentally exhausting

as i mentioned, i have already been to a psychologist and i plan to go back, as well as to a psychiatrist to try medication again. i did not take the previous meds regularly - they helped in the sense that i stopped waking up during the night, but i still did not feel rested. i also plan to see a neurologist, because i do not want to lose half of my life to this. recently, i have noticed an increase in symptoms that resemble ocd, and i am afraid this might also be contributing to my sleep problems, although, as i said, my sleep has been bad for years

Last year I found out I had severe sleep apnea and I was having 70 events per hour. So I was put on CPAP in February and I’ve taken well to it. I can’t be without it now. Just before I got it I had a mental breakdown and I didn’t sleep for 2 weeks. I labelled myself an insomniac after that, it traumatised me and have struggled with sleep. I’ve been desperate to get back in to that 8 hour routine since being on cpap with no joy. 50% of nights I can but the other I can’t get anywhere close. My doc says I’m trying to get sleep I don’t need now I’m not waking 70 times an hour. Could this be right? ",1765999739.0,0,2,insomnia,sleep

Thinking about how I NEED to sleep because I have work/life the next day. I don't do good on no sleep, I become a ln emotional sensitive puddle. I think knowing that and knowing I have to wake up make me anxious, my heart starts beating really hard, and my whole body feels like it's got electricity pulsing through it. I'm so tired but feel like I could run around my house. 
  So what do you recommend? This is newer to me, I've always struggled with going to sleep, but lately it's been 2-5am before I fall asleep.... Tea sometimes helps, I've tried staying off my phone before going to sleep and sometimes it works but when it didn't and I still couldn't sleep then I was like well, I guess it wasn't my phone.

1pp2ish,Advice for what to drop; popping awake 4-5am,"I've made progress against intractable insomnia over the past year, with CPAP, meds and exercise. I was sleeping so well in August I thought I could fly, but unfortunately something changed and sleep turned bad in September and October. Started to turn around in November with treating bartonella and Lyme (I have chronic Lyme, which I thought I had beaten). I've had really good nights, but current problem is waking up at 4-5am and never really going back to sleep. 

I'm also feeling empty/down/blah, which I think is from sleep meds. I have cut a lot over the past few months, but wanted advice on what to cut next but still keep sleeping.

Current sleep meds/supplements:

2 valerian capsules 700mg root, 400mg extract

1 kava capsules 425mg - Gaia

2 Mg glycinate 260mg

2 GABA 750mg

250 mg trazodone

400 mg l-theanine Suntheanine

15mg melatonin tablet time release - high dose on doc's advice

7.5mg melatonin sublingual

1/2 Unisom

1 pot gummy 10mg THC 5mg CBN -- this works great to put me to sleep

Have cut gabapentin, methocarbamol, and flexeril entirely. Gave me a mood/clarity boost for a bit but it's faded. Working on cutting the antihistamines as they also cause some other side effects. 

Appreciate any advice on getting back to sleeping all night, or being able to go back to sleep after waking like I could in August. Really tired of that headache coming back--you know the one.

1pp1l6x,Wanted to share an update: Have been sleeping better since I stopped caring about it.,"Update to a post I made a little over a week ago
https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1pido1z/im_done_trying_to_cure_my_insomnia/

I just want to share that I have been sleeping so much better ever since I stopped trying so hard to cure my insomnia. I simply stopped caring about it and accepted the fact that I'm going to be tired everyday and it's fine. I was trying melatonin, L Theanine, magnesium, vitamin d (in the morning), tart cherries and yet my sleep continued to get worse and worse. For four weeks in a row I was averaging about 5.5 hours of sleep per night despite trying all these sleep aids. 

Finally after a 4-hour night I decided enough was enough and I was going to stop stressing about it and stop looking for a solution. I purposely tried to make myself even more tired the next day by not taking melatonin and trying to keep my eyes wide open. I couldn't keep them open for more than a couple minutes and I slept hard. I checked my sleep data this morning and this is what it's looked like over the last week or so.

12/11 4hrs 43 min

12/12 7hrs 2 min

12/13 6hrs 20 min

12/14: 7hrs 9 min

12/15: 6hrs 23 min

12/16: 5hrs 38 min

12/17 (last night): 7hrs 45 min


And yesterday I didn't let the fact that I slept less than 6 hours the night before bother me. As much as my brain wanted to obsess over it, I simply told myself that's all I needed to sleep. I was slightly tired but I tried not to let that bother me. And of course last night I rebounded pretty hard. 

Everyday is a mental battle and I understand how easy it is to become anxious and stressed when you haven't had good sleep for days in a row. But you have to stay strong. Don't let it break you. Don't let it bother you. Remember sleep is self regulating and your sleep needs change day to day. There is no sleep IRS coming to collect on sleep debt (which has just become a fear mongering term).

If you've ruled out underlying medical issues, then acceptance and indifference is truly the cure for insomnia. Sleep aid supplements are not going to help you overcome your sleep issues long term. Limiting blue light and obsessing over sleep hygiene is only going to fuel your anxiety about sleep. 

1. Accept that you're going to be tired.

2. Stop caring about it. It is what it is.

3. While in bed, stop ""trying"" to sleep and do the exact opposite. See how long you can keep your eyes open. If you can keep them open all night, you win.",1765990409.0,16,19,insomnia,sleep

1pp075d,Is there a name for this phenomenon?,"Hi there! So I’ve had sleep issues for about 4-5 years now, since getting a head injury. I’ve been diagnosed with insomnia and am in the process of getting an official diagnosis of narcolepsy. I have sleep paralysis very often as well as nightmares and whatnot. 

I’m not asking for medical advice - just… language advice I suppose? I’m curious if anyone else has experienced this? And if they know what it’s called? So I can better speak to my doctor about it, as he seems kinda confused by it when I try to explain it to him.

So - when you have sleep paralysis essentially your mind wakes up too fast and your body is still paralyzed, right? You have control of your thoughts, but not of your body and often times your body will throw the hallucination type nightmare things at you like shadow people. 

What I’m describing seems.. similar to that. I think it has to do with my body waking up too fast or improperly some how. Maybe it’s related to sleep walking?

I’ll sometimes (practically every day) wake up, but just my body at first. My mind will still be in the dream, and I won’t be conscious, but my body will start doing movements. And they aren’t dream movements like sleep walking. They’re… as if I’m awake. This morning I was still in my dream, but when I came too I realized I had been sitting up, trying to untangle my hair, and my dog was acting like I had been petting her belly. 

This was not things that were happening in my dream, but they are things I do when I wake up every morning. I usually sit up and pet my dog for a few minutes, and I always finger comb my hair before using a real comb because of my hair texture. In my dream I was having a full on conversation with someone about something that I can’t really remember but I was standing and walking around in it. 

If someone is around, like when I was in a relationship, they can have a conversation with sleeping-me and I’ll answer back but have no recollection of it at all. But the conversation isn’t random ramblings like normally is the case with sleep talkers, it’s coherent thoughts and actual answers. My ex once told me he talked to me for a solid 5-8 minutes before I looked at him suddenly and asked what we were talking about and he realized I had been asleep the whole time. During that “talk” I had been laying in bed but occasionally opening my eyes and turning to look at him. 

I’m not looking for medical/treatment advice. I have a good sleep specialist who I think will be able to help with this. I just am hoping someone else has heard of this so maybe at my next appointment I can go to him with a term since he seemed really confused when I tried to explain it (and did so pretty poorly I’m sure).

Ive tried: zolpidem, zopiclone, daridorexant, temazepam, melatonin, olanzapine, mirtazipine, cocktail of suppliments and nothing helps. Not even a little bit. 

This all stemmed from being injected with clopixol in '22 which was medical malpractice as I was not psychotic and id already had a bad reaction to it. It made me very unwell for about 2 years.

Then last year around December my insomnia came back, im not stressed or overthinking. My mind is blank pretty much always. I cant even share the night with someone as its so hard to fall asleep and even when I do I wake up just a few hours later. 

Ive tried magnesium, theanine, tryptophan, glycine, lemon balm, tart cherry - in terms of suppliments.

1pohnw6,Dayvigo nightmare,"Since starting Dayvigo, my sleep has become significantly more fragmented. I am falling asleep briefly but waking repeatedly with vivid nightmares, intense anxiety, and a racing heart. My heart rate would jump 30 bpm higher than normal, I’d wake up with intrusive thoughts and nightmares that’s starting to make me question my sanity. I normally fall asleep fast n early but had problems staying asleep but with dayvigo it seems like I’d wake up more often. Usually an hour or 2 after falling asleep I’d wake up in a panic, highly anxious but too foggy to do much about it. I’d get off the bed if I can’t fall back asleep in 15 minutes but usually I end up pacing around the house for an hour or so. 

When I fall asleep the second time, same cycle repeats. It’s deeply uncomfortable and my thoughts have gone to a very dark places in these moments. After these awakenings I feel extremely wired, almost like a stimulant effect, rather than sedated. My body aches and I am unable to return to restful sleep. I’ve been on benzos n zopiclone before but none have given this type of side effects. I got off them 6 months n a year ago trying to find a more natural way to stay asleep. Magnesium works initially but over time it loses its effects. I kept my physical body tired during the day if I don’t workout at the very least I’d try to go over 10k steps a day. I do yoga, I lift, I run. I get sunshine in my eyes upon waking every morning and I go for walks upon waking usually I start at 5-7am. I stopped drinking coffee or any caffeinated drinks. I’m really trying. My psychiatrist had suggested dayvigo months ago but I’ve been resisting the idea. Eventually I was only getting 1-3h of sleep nightly so I caved n got the dayvigo. Had only tried it for 3 nights but this seems like a worse quality of sleep I’m getting. While my sleep metrics say that I’m getting more sleep, it’s more fragmented and doesn’t feel restorative. Also my mental health is in the gutter. Idk if it’s the prolonged lack of sleep but I don’t feel “normal”.

I went to bed at 10:15pm, and if I slept, it was a very light sleep (this light sleep has been happening for a while now once a week almost). I had to get up and saw that it was already 12:30am and I still hadn't really fallen asleep.

I tried once again and if I got sleep it was again an hour or so of light sleep with some dreaming. Just at 8am I was able to sleep until 11:15am after taking 2mg of clonazepam and some quetiapine again.

I have chronic insomnia, BFS (linked to sleep deprivation and it started after a big period of sleep deprivation), and I definitely also have Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder. Been also dealing with heart palpitations recently.

GHB works perfectly with me, I can sleep whenever I want, which is very important cause when I sleep early all my symptoms start to reverse.

If I had access to Xywav I’d be living a normal life for a while now, but it’s not available in my country and it’s 15x more expensive than Xyrem for some reason to import it here (and you gotta hope the government will accept to pay, but even with Xyrem people are struggling to get it approved).

So at least this corruption on the medication price needs to stop, cause it’s causing harm even to narcoleptics worldwide, as in my country for example they only have access to Xyrem, the oldest/outdated pharmaceutical GHB, full of sodium.

GHB is simply to synthesize and shouldn’t at all be this expensive, and let’s not forget the $145 million that Jazz Pharmaceuticals had to recently pay for conspiring against the generic version of Xyrem.

It’s time for this BS to end, at the very least this overpriced corruption should definitely end by now. GHB for severe insomnia is common sense, as it’s a great, strong sleep aid and it immensely enhances slow-wave sleep/deep sleep, which is great for overall health.

It’s insane that something so simple became so complicated and bureaucratic. And this is science, we should be evolving instead of regressing and being stuck with all this corruption and greed.

Following a stressful episode in August related to digestive symptoms, I underwent numerous medical tests (MRI, gastroscopy, colonoscopy, etc.) and lost 12 kg. In the end, everything was normal with my digestive system, but I started experiencing severe insomnia.


I was diagnosed with depression and put on Xanax as needed at first, then routinely, and finally Brintellix a month ago. I'm currently hospitalized in a psychiatric clinic...

Today, I'm convinced that while I certainly have anxiety, I also have a prion disease like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or fatal insomnia. My symptoms are getting worse and worse:


- The most worrying thing is that I'm only getting 2 to 3 hours of sleep a night (it was more like 6 two weeks ago), no deep sleep, and especially more and more myoclonic jerks, spasms in my limbs, almost convulsions that start in my solar plexus. I can't fall asleep (naps, etc.).

- Visual disturbances: decreased near vision, new myopia, blurred vision. Sometimes double vision, the impression that my left eye is misaligned. Photophobia: Everything bright is more intense

- Weakness and muscle wasting
- Dry mouth, dry eyes
- Exhaustion, continued weight loss and fatigue
- Night sweats
- Slow digestion
- Rapid breathing
- Memory problems improved by Brintellix
- Myosis

MRU shows a chronic leucopathia but I had mych less symptoms at that time.
- The neurologist at the clinic thinks everything is somatic, and the psychiatrist wants to prescribe a second antidepressant to get rid of my obsession with prion disease.

I also have issues with gums and gum inflammation and my dentist prescribed Metradinazole to treat it. I was first panicking because I read it ca cause insomnia and I didn’t want more of it. However, I was shocked to find out that for a few days I felt really amazing, I slept better, was more rested and a lot less anxious, I could enjoy life for a bit. Now that’s all gone and I’m back to my ‘normal’ way, which is extremely tiring. What do you think happened, why I felt so much better? Could my insomnia be related to gut related issues or other issue that the antibiotic was treating indirectly?",1765862115.0,5,6,insomnia,sleep
1pntbhw,this is my story i am tired,"hello everyone i am 29F going to be 30 soon 

i have been battling sleep anxiety since October

it started suddenly 

this is going to be long 

so starting of October

it was a normal day i went to sleep-as usual and damn when i closed my eyes and tried to sleep it sets me off

my heart started racing and chest muscle started clenching even harder because of the palpitations i couldn’t sleep at all and i got fearful of this thing so the first night went like this and i couldn’t sleep 

the next day i felt like a zombie with zero sleep at night everyone said its okkk it happens sometimes 

i was like no its not its different 

i used to be the type who could sleep instantly anywhere and anytime and i slept instantly as my head hits the pillow 

i was so frustrated i cried so much because sleep is so precious to me 

the next day i tried to nap and yes it happened again 

little did i know that it will be like this 

so night came and yes i went to bed with positive affirmations 

i also went to hospital in day because i was so so frustrated they gave me sleeping pills and i took not only one but two of them 

i skipped work because i couldn’t process anything at all

so that night i took 2 sleeping pills and ofc i slept 

the next night it happened again i slept for like 4 hours only i wanted to take sleeping pills again but couldn’t muster up the courage 

then i went on like this for the rest of the month

symptoms kept adding up now when i started sleeping and if i by mistake was in sleep my whole would suddenly vibrate and my breathing stopped then yes i was not able to going to sleep again because yes i was no longer one of those people who could sleep again like normal 

my thoughts went dark and i started having panic attacks when i slept i accumulated the fear of sleeping so yess panic attacks would wake me up and i was sweating heart racing 

sometimes i would walk in sleep and would talk to my mom briefly and then went to sleep again

next day my mom would tell me this i was shocked

all of these things kept happening till mid november 

because of peak anxiety and stress idk if thats the cause i had a vertigo attack i was eating normally it happened so suddenly 

then that day i was in vertigo all the time 

i couldn’t even walk straight and by so much effort i laid down 

yes stress does crazy things to your body

now i was in for a new ride you can see the posts on my feed you will know what i went through plss do if you are reading all of this

so fast forward to night of 14 December 

after these new symptoms thank god i was able to sleep well for 8 hours

but heres the thing i went to sleep normally on 13 december i woke up at 3:30 am midnight all sweaty and then i thought its okkk its normal

then i was awake and suddenly electricity gone and i am afraid of the dark yess i am 

and i was so anxious oh my god i cant even tell that was the starting point of these things happening again

now when i closed my eyes, i would see patterns and oh my god i cant even tell that literally killed me 

anxiety at its peak again 

now after overthinking all day about sleep problems and then all this shit happening 

i went to bed on 15 December and yes i didn’t slept even a bit 

symptoms changed their intensity 

i am totally going crazy now 

i am suffering with bouncy vision and when i move my head i get so so dizzy

i want to cry so bad i am screaming inside

i take magnesium glycinate 200 mg and its not helping at all

pls tell me what should i do 

i am literally having suicidal thoughts 

my family understands but not everything i tired if telling things to people now some laugh at my condition and say you are crazy 

doctors also say you are crazy 😭

i am getting no reassurance

its very easy to get stressed of things i am going through i am hanging by a thread now ",1765860811.0,2,2,insomnia,sleep
1pnt7kd,Just learned about paradoxical insomnia and it checks out.,"I'm normally very anxious and often get trouble to sleep.

While I'm used to that, on some nights, I enter this weird trance where my brain just loops to 2 or 3 thoughts and I'm just unable to sleep no matter how long I wait.

It's not like a rumination where I'm looping scenarios in my head anxiously. Those happen but what I'm talking about is when my brain just doesn't seem to want to sleep and starts shuffling the same exact two or three thoughts, something like a specific image or a single sentence. And it goes on for hours. Sometimes the whole night.

Anybody has ever dealt with this? And if so, is there a name to this thing? I've learned about paradoxal insomnia and it's the closest thing. I just can't prove that I'm getting rest since I use no apps and I sleep alone lol, there's no one to tell me I'm actually sleeping.

Either way. When I get those weird nights, I just don't feel as tired as when I pull a geniune all nighter so maybe I am getting rest in the end. 

Anyone else has dealt with this?


Tl;dr : weird insomnias where my brain circles in a thought loop for hours on end. (not ruminations or anxious thoughts). Anyone else have this?

1pnohky,My Thoughts on Comorbid ADHD and Z Drug Resistance,"In my experience, psychiatrists generally regard the Z drugs as near-infallible treatments and don't offer anything beyond that.

I find the Z drugs (zolpidem/Ambien, zaleplon/Sonata, zopiclone or eszopiclone) don't really work too well. They aren't strong sedatives and rely mostly on hypnotic action to bring you to sleep. To sleep on Z drugs, you basically just have to zone out for a bit. 

My ADHD mind is just constantly active without reprieve (although not necessarily in an anxious way), making a simple zone-out very difficult with the weak sedation of any Z drug.

I don't think psychiatrists realize that, or at least none that I've had before. I think a good regiment would be benzos during the week to get good rest for work, and lemborexant on weekends to lower risk of dependence.

Has anyone felt a similar way? Treatment-resistant insomnia is driving me insane and the doctors aren't empathetic when Z drugs don't work.",1765846646.0,2,12,insomnia,sleep
1pnod6h,im so sorry its me again,"its 12:46 and ive had two sleepeaze tablets (100mg diphenhydramine total. i know the recommended dose is 50mg but ive slept about 2 hours in the past week total)

i was at work today and im starting to hallucinate. tomorrow im supposed to hang out with some friends, but i honestly dont really want to. all i want to do is manage to get some rest, and i cant even do that. a basic fucking human function and i cant manage it.

im 23, female and in the uk. the doctor wont just give me medication, i know that, all of the info ive found says im way too young. but i dont think i have it in me to go one more night like this

im scared of getting addicted to anything they could give me anyway. im a year and a half sober from opioids, and i dont want to go back to that struggle. i take 45mg of mirtazapine, which acts as a stimulant at that dosage, but i need that mirtazapine or my ocd will just be the thing keeping me up all night. i cant stress enough to you just how much i need mirtazapine to live.

honestly i miss the bloody opioids. at least they helped me sleep for a little bit.

edit: doctors appointment went okay. i got prescribed some promethazine. diphenhydramine didnt do anything for me and promethazine is just another antihistamine, but if i turned it down i wouldnt get anything at all. so i might just have to stick it out for another couple of weeks until i go back to her. i know there is also an addiction risk with promethazine, but i guess ill just have to be careful",1765846313.0,12,42,insomnia,sleep

GP prescribed me 25mg daridorexant and at first it was working great, got me to sleep. Sleep paralysis stopped after around 4 week mark and I stopped taking it a few months after because I didn't need it! 

5 months down the line I'm in the same position again, so started back on it but strangely it's a completely different experience, I can't easily get to sleep.

200 mg Lyrica, 30 mg melatonin, 20 mg baclofen.

1pnc3x2,Its happenign again? (vent),"I came here to vent, though it's not my first time posting in places like this. So here's my story.

About two months ago I had a job interview in another state (Florida to Indiana). The day before, while getting ready for the flight, I drank two Monsters back to back. I'd never done that before. We flew out that night and arrived early in the morning. That night I couldn't sleep at all, but since we got in late I figured it was just nerves about the interview, so I decided to just stay awake.

The next morning everything went GREAT. Basically my dream job. Good pay, beautiful location, super friendly people, amazing interviewers, everything I could ask for. We also saw our future home, brand new apartments that we'd be the first to live in. Our dream life.

I'd already been awake for over 24 hours, so we went to a hotel. During the day everything was fine, but that night I couldn't sleep at all. Zero sleep. I couldn't fall asleep and I got really nervous. I bought Zzzquil, melatonin, and a bunch of other stuff thinking it would help, but nothing worked.

By the next morning, with 48 hours without sleep, I got even more anxious. We went to the ER. They ran several tests and told me my blood pressure was fine (I have hypertension) and that it was just anxiety and stress. They said they weren't going to prescribe me sleeping pills. By the way, I'm still paying off that ER visit.

That night we went back to Ohio to catch a flight home. That night I couldn't sleep either. Zero sleep. We missed our flight because I was so slow. We finally made it home around noon the next day. I tried to sleep but the AC at my girlfriend's place started acting up and I think with all the nerves I just couldn't. I decided to drive from Tampa to Miami (where I lived and my family was). It was almost impossible but I made it.

After 3 nights and something without sleep, my dad, who is a nurse, gave me a 0.5 mg Alprazolam and I passed out. After that night I slept relatively normal, though I still felt scared at night, like it was going to happen again. But I always fell asleep eventually. It's like I couldn't relax and my mind kept expecting it to happen again.

Fast forward to two weeks ago. Two months had passed. I moved in with my girlfriend, we have a new home, great jobs, and one day I stayed up late programming something. I was a bit nervous because it was software that was going to help us a lot at work. And that night it happened again. What I thought wouldn't happen again, happened. My fear came back. That night I couldn't sleep, but I didn't take anything weird. I went to work exhausted the next day. The following night I took two 0.5 mg Alprazolam to fall asleep, and it worked.

I was like that for about a week, maybe 8 days. Then after staying up late on Saturday and waking up late on Sunday, I think that messed me up. I don't know. I had to take two melatonin gummies because I don't want to depend on Alprazolam again. I slept, but badly. But now the fear was back.

So I decided to change my life for the better. I got a gym membership and started going. The first 3 nights I took melatonin to sleep well, and then after that just linden tea (I've been drinking it every night this past week). And I was fine. I slept well. I'd get in bed, close my eyes, and sleep perfectly.

But if I'm being honest, the last two days there was a lot of snow and I didn't want to go to the gym even though it's super close. It was an excuse.

This weekend I went to bed late, around 1:30 AM on Saturday, and then woke up at 11 AM. And last night when I tried to go to sleep around 11:30 PM I couldn't sleep at all. I think what happens is that if I don't fall asleep fast, I overthink it and then I can't sleep.

Which brings me to today. I haven't slept at all. I'm so scared of going through all this again. It hurts because I had a perfect week. Sleeping well, doing great at work, I was even happy. But the weekends mess everything up again.

It's kind of hard, you know? Sometimes these thoughts become everything I am. It's like I can't see clearly because something is clouding my vision. Something I can't see but I know is behind my eyes, where I can't reach. I need to get better.

Sorry for coming here to vent. I know there are people going through much worse than me, and I really want to tell everyone that I'm sorry for everything you're going through.

I'm 50 now &  there weren't many books about it when I was younger. 

I've always felt like I was being watched, I see shadow people sometimes and I've done everything I can to convince myself there's nothing there, but it hasn't stopped. I'm afraid if I accept that something is actually there, I will get hurt psychologically & possibly physically.

A number of years back, I found that if I tried to take a nap on my left, I would wake up very alert only a few minutes later (I had a newborn, so I definitely wanted/needed to nap). Over time, this transformed into if I tried to sleep on my left I would just lay and lay and lay in bed not able to fall asleep. However, if I flipped to my right, I'd automatically be asleep. I had no discomfort on my left -- it was as nice and comfy as ever -- I just couldn't sleep that way anymore. I started sleeping on my right.

Fast forward and one day the same thing started happening on my right side. Again, no length of waiting it out would result in sleep -- I've literally laid in bed all night on my right side/stomach hoping to ""win"" and it's not worked.

So I started sleeping on my back. You can guess from here. It started that if my head was leaning left I couldn't sleep. I'd even wake up if my head shifted during sleep. I am down to about 2 fairly awkward positions that allow me to sleep (though not well) and honestly I'm starting to get issues with them as well.

I feel like I'm losing my mind, as well as my ability to sleep. I've sometimes noticed recently if I wake up in a ""bad"" position that my chest feels a little off -- like I haven't been breathing well -- so I wonder if there is something physiological behind what is happening?

And for reference I work a sedentary job at a doctors office. On weekends, I sleep so amazingly and deep. It’s been three weeks now. Its amazes me that I’m still able to perform at my job, but it’s taking a serious toll on my body. I’m miserable. What can I do to fix this? Should I see a doctor?

I have used melatonin and zzquil and Advil pm and niquil and Benadryl and everything just seems to make the jitters worse, nothing works to calm my body down, or make me less stressed. I know this is an issue with having to sleep to perform at work and it relates to the stress of that. Idk what to do. I know I’m not broken, but I sure feel like it.",1765781383.0,1,5,insomnia,sleep
1pn0mdg,ACT-I help,"Hi,

I’ve been looking into ACT-I and I know that it is the right approach for me. My insomnia started with a steroid prescription and I have one day per week I’m awake the entire night due to fear of not being able to sleep before work. Other nights it may take me a few hours, and weekends I don’t have a problem.

My question is HOW do you genuinely believe you don’t care how much sleep you get? I keep telling myself I have before and will again get through the work day on no sleep. However I can’t get myself to truly not care about not being able to sleep. I can’t trick my own brain lol.

1pmklzj,My bf telling me bedtime stories went viral here last time... but now I’m trying to solve the nights he’s not around. Am I overthinking this?,"A while back, I shared how my boyfriend tells me improvised bedtime stories to help me fall asleep. I honestly didn't expect the response—it got over 52k views and the top comment was essentially ""Protect this man at all cost."" I am really happy to see how many of us are craving that specific feeling of being ""tucked in.""

But the reality is: he can't always do it. Sometimes he’s exhausted, sometimes he falls asleep first, or sometimes we are apart.

I’ve tried the usual suspects (Calm, podcasts, YouTube rain sounds). They’re *okay*, but they just somehow lack that specific comfort. They don't know that I'm stressed about a presentation tomorrow, and they can't tell a silly story about my plushie to distract me. Plus, sometimes the narrator's voice just... annoys me? (Is that just my insomnia brain being picky?)

Here is where my crazy idea comes in: I’m a software engineer by day. I’ve been tinkering with a side project to see if I can recreate that ""boyfriend experience"".

Basically, I want to build something where:

1. The Voice is Familiar: You could clone a voice that actually soothes you (a partner, a comfort character, etc.) rather than a generic narrator.
2. The Story Knows You: Instead of a generic ""walk in the forest,"" it talks you down from your specific daily worries or tells a story involving things you actually like.

I don't know, maybe I'm just being picky with the apps I have now. I just really want that feeling of a story that's actually for me, not just a generic recording. Has anyone else felt that specific gap, or have you found an app that actually nails the personal feeling?

Anyway, I’m probably going to mess around with the code for my own use regardless. But do let me know if this sound like something that would actually help you guys, or it's my sleep-deprived brain just over-engineering a simple problem lol. ",1765735574.0,1,0,insomnia,sleep

1pmbo1e,I fall asleep by looking at the inside of my eyelids,"Yes it sounds weird, but it works about 80% of the time for me. Eyes closed. By trying to look at my eyelids my brain is focused on "" looking at something"" verses running wild. There's nothing to see of course but it seems to help my brain slip into sleep mode. I suggested this to a friend and they said they fell asleep right away. Rather small sample size at this point, but I thought I'd throw it out there. 

Edit: You have to keep at it a while but I think I usually fall asleep within about 10 minutes. Just don't let your mind wander... keep focused on trying to see something on the inside of your eyelids. 

Edit 2: I tried this out to get a better idea of what I'm actually doing. It is not the same as just watching the flashes. I'm actively, oh so slightly, actively looking, focusing on my eyelids. My eyeballs ever so slightly converge as if I'm looking and focusing on something close. Then a minute or two later they relax. And I'll realize they've relaxed and I try to see closely again. And they will just naturally relax again after a minute or so. This repeats until I fall asleep. I think the process just activates a part of the brain that's not normally in use when I try to sleep. After 5 or 10 minutes my brain gets bored trying to see something that's not there and I fall asleep. If this doesn't work for you in about 10 minutes I would give up on it because you are actually using some muscles in your eyes and you don't want to strain yourself.",1765710762.0,3,3,insomnia,sleep
1pmaohg,"I keep getting ADHD focused on a cause I started a month ago, (when my fiance of six yrs left without warning, communication, or sympathy)","My fiancee left me after six years together. A big part of it was that I became intensely focused on an online cause and a small nonprofit I started. She did not believe in it politically and eventually she stopped believing in me.

I feel like I completely lost myself. In a very literal sense, my identity collapsed. Now the less I fight it, the more I drift toward this cause, even though I am not sure it is realistic or sustainable for someone like me.

To cope with the constant brain fog, it feels like I am stuck in a permanent stimulant cycle. Vyvanse during the day and short bursts of Adderall just to function.

Psychologically, I think part of this is my refusal to let her be right. My brain will not let me rest until I prove something, until I make something meaningful out of myself through this nonprofit. When I do not take Adderall, my dopamine drops hard and I am forced to sit with emotions I genuinely do not know how to process yet. When that happens, I spiral in unhealthy ways.

I end up staying awake for three to four days at a time, repeatedly, until I either hit a near psychotic state or I completely crash. Lately I have been asking myself a question that scares me.

What irreversible damage am I doing to my brain

I think I always assumed my brain would reset after I finally slept. Deep down I know that is not how it works.

Got a bit of a vulnerable topic here. I got no one in my circle to discuss this with. 

I don't want to make this post too long. So i'll keep it straight to the point.

If I don't have sex or masterbate once a day. My body goes into the wired & tired mode (racing thoughts, high heartbeat, anxious, no sleep pressure and unable to rest or sleep) and stays stuck there until the deed is done and it settles down a bit and I can sleep. It doesnt feel like addiction because other things like exercise, mental stress or not taking specific supplements (iodine) can trigger it also  even if I had an orgasm prior. Sometimes I forget or don't want to but my symptoms get so bad it leaves me no other choice. So my insomnia is'nt revolved around this perse but at the same time this feels like a requirement to sleep.

Overall on a day to day basis this isn't really a big deal but it sucks because I kinda feel a prisoner in my own body and can't do stuff I want to do.

1pm1hyg,terrible terrible night,"I went to sleep last night thinking it would be another normal night. I already felt anxiety creeping in for no clear reason, which usually happens to me at night, so at first I thought it would pass and I’d eventually fall asleep.

On normal nights, I don’t fall asleep right away—it usually takes me about an hour to an hour and a half. But last night felt different. At some point, I genuinely got scared because my mind was so loud.

To explain: in order for me to fall asleep, I usually imagine things or think of scenarios that slowly turn into a dream. That’s how I’ve always fallen asleep. But last night, it felt impossible. Every single time my thoughts were about to drift into a dream, I would suddenly flinch awake. It felt like my body and mind didn’t want me to fall asleep at all.

What made it worse was that I was so tired and sleepy, but my mind refused to cooperate. It felt like I was forcing sleep, which I know is a big no when it comes to avoiding insomnia, but I honestly couldn’t help it. The longer I stayed awake, the more scared I became—especially because we had to wake up early for church and then celebrate my father’s birthday, so I knew it was going to be a long day.

I also have anxiety around time. When I know what time it is—especially if it’s already late—I get nervous. I start mentally counting the hours, guessing what time it is, and that just makes it even harder to sleep. That was definitely a big trigger last night.

I eventually slept (THANK GOD), but I honestly don’t know how long. Maybe around 2 hours 😭 Now I’m feeling nauseous and dizzy from the lack of sleep, and I’m nervous that this will happen again.

I’ve always slept in just boxer briefs or naked because I thought it was more comfortable and less constricting. I thought pajamas were dorky. 

I’ve had trouble sleeping as long as I remember, but lately it’s been really bad. I’ve only been sleeping a couple hours each night and it was ruining my life. I’ve tried melatonin and lots of different pills with no luck. 

I was desperate and willing to try anything. I decided now that it’s winter I’d try wearing clothes to bed. Specifically the waffle-knit long underwear and a long sleeve t-shirt or undershirt. And I’m happy to say I’ve been sleeping better this last week than I have in years.

The tactile sense of wearing long sleeves and long underwear is like a warm embrace or getting a gentle hug. They’re form-fitting yet loose enough to be comfy. (I’ve tried wearing normal pajama pants to bed and they were too baggy and hot).

Ive been falling asleep fast, sleeping, dreaming and waking up feeling refreshed. I feel happier than I’ve been in a long time. It’s only been a week so I don’t want to get ahead of myself, but for now it’s been making a HUGE difference.

1pluifz,New and Worsening Insomnia Unexplained,"Hey guys, super confusing stuff going on with my sleep lately. Am feeling extremely desperate for answers so any input at all is appreciated.

I (25M) have always been able to sleep 9+ hours straight, if given the opportunity. Since i was a kid, all the way up to 23 years old, it wasnt uncommon for me to sleep 11 hours without getting up once. I used to hate it because it would be a pain to get up to my alarm in the morning. But now id do anything to get that kind of sleep back.

I moved from the northeast to the deep south about 2 years ago. About 3 months in, my sleep became extremely fragile and hard to maintain. Suddenly i was waking up multiple times in the middle of the night and my final wake up is always way before my alarm. This started to get worse and worse by the night until eventually I was getting like 3-5 hours of sleep, waking up in a panic and not being able to fall back to sleep. it was nightly.

One thing i could never figure out is that when id go back home for holidays and to see friends and family, id sleep like a baby for at LEAST half the days i was there. That happened up until a little past a year.....now it doesnt matter where i go, im not getting good sleep. but ive tried hard to look for answers within that clue. came up dry besides allergies but i take Loratadine (Claritin) daily. so that didnt make sense to me.

So before I started down the medical route, I tried EVERYTHING you could think of to try and fix this. My excersize schedule, every suppliment/medication for sleep you can think of, meditation, yoga, breathework, grounding/circadian work, no eating after certain times, room temp changes, bedding changes, NEW BED IN A NEW APARTMENT, no blue light after sun goes down, and many other things. Obviously the stronger medications worked but only to the extent that I could fall back asleep after waking up (literally nothing kept me from waking up in the middle of the night, 4-5 hours into sleep) 

So the next thing i tried was a CGM (continuous glucose monitor) and it did show that i was experiencing small drops when id wake up in the middle of the night....but, it lead me nowhere. i tried changing up diet and optimizing blood sugar and even going carnivore for a month. carnivore allowed me to get a little bit more sleep before waking up, but it certainly wasnt the cure i was looking for. i concluded the blood sugar drops were more likely caused by the wakeup (cortisol, adrenaline rush) opposed to the blood sugar drop CAUSING the wake up.

Overtime, nothing worked and my wake ups started to become more violent (sweating, heartrate at 180, blood pressure spiked massively, anger, more cortisol, more adrenaline) but i never woke up out of breathe and never snored so i figured it wasnt sleep apnea. I got the sleep study anyways just to rule it out (at home WatchPAT study)

The results:

AHI 4
RDI 19

which was a shock to me because id never had symptoms of sleep disordered breathing at all. i breathed through my nose every day during the day, i used intake breathing strips while i was asleep, i taped my mouth shut most nights (i didnt tape it during my sleep study) never made a difference if i did or not though, id still wake up.

so technically an AHI under 5 is normal but an RDI of 19 is ""moderate"" so i went down the rabbit whole and discovered something that happens in low ahi, high rdi patients. its called UARS (upper airway resistance syndrome). and i actually found that a lot of people who are dealing with UARS are dealing with what i am dealing with. I thought this was my smoking gun....especially since id had a septoplasty and turbinate reduction when i was 21. wisdom teeth out when i was 19.

I immediately bought a SnoreRX mandibular device, which made zero difference to me at all. didnt work even on highest setting for multiple nights. when that didnt work i went to an ENT who did a CT scan and a nasal endoscopy on me. Everything looked normal except my left inferior turbinate was very enlarged. We also did an allergy test, considering this started happening after i moved here, but i take Loratadine (Claritin) daily anyways so it didnt make sense that allergies was causing symptoms but only at hours 4-6 during sleep and no other times at all. yes, i had some allergies but nothing bad enough to explain random wake ups..... ive also tried manyyyy other allergy meds and antihistamines on this journey. again, i have zero symptoms of allergies.

so me and my doc decided we were going to do a septum adjustment (greenstick break, not an entire septoplasty) and a turbinate reduction on the left side only.

so here we are, today, its 12 days post surgery and i definitely breathe better!!!.....but dont sleep any better at all. if i want 6 hours i have to be in bed for like 12 and thats if i can keep putting myself back to sleep. not to mention the quality of sleep sucks. id say im averaging about 4-5 hours a night. i am becoming so desperate for answers. i never feel like i slept well and i have haulted most life activities besides working out because i do not have it in me to be social and fun.

i have always been an easy going and fun guy. this has ruined that for me. i met a girl when i moved here and things were amazing until i couldnt help but to show the symptoms of my sleep problems. it tore us down daily. its all i could think about, talk about, care about. it felt/feels like my body is degrading. putting together thoughts is infinitely harder than it used to be. it became harder to remember to buy her flowers, to ask her about her day, to put my anger and frustration aside and start the day off in a good mood. we broke up 2 weeks ago directly because of this. ill do anything to get my sleep back because im under its thumb and it controls my life.

i dont even know where to turn now. i dont know what my next move is considering
*jaw is not recessed
*palate looks normal
*tongue base looks normal
*tonsils and adenoids are normal
*turbinates and septum are now normal
*tried every suppliment/medicine under the sun
*tried every holistic circadian/mental method

i just want things to go back to how they were. i could sleep anywhere, anytime, for however long i wanted. fitbit showed 3 hours rem and 3 hours deep sleep on good nights..... now im lucky if i get above an hour of rem. I woke up 7 different times last night to get 6 hours and 15 minutes of sleep. i was in bed for 13 hours.

could this be nervous system related? is it likely that my nervous system is just hyperaroused now for some reason and cant go back? is there a fix for that? i hardly know what questions to even ask anymore.

Thank you if you took the time to read. I know a lot of people in this sub are dealing with their own sleep problems so if you read through mine, just know i appreciate it.

1plq79n,Middle insomnia is returning. Best sleep meds to minimize rebound insomnia? (i.e. Ambien?),"As someone with middle insomnia that has been returning in recent months (i.e. wake up after 3 hours, then stay awake), I've been thinking about what medicines are best for me to take.

I've been mainly using Ambien when I wake up, as in theory I know Ambien is safer to take for insomnia than Xanax or Klonopin - and even came across this study that claims twelve months of Ambien does not lead to rebound insomnia or withdrawal - [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3711112/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3711112/) . But I know anecdotally everyone is different.

My concern about rebound insomnia is that last time I had bad middle insomnia, I wasn't able to tell the difference between my actual insomnia and any potential rebound. I have cut out using Xanax for sleep, as that used to be primary go to for anxiety driven midnight wakings. But the amount of days middle insomnia occurs ends up being too long for xanax to make sense, and I'm usually not anxious when awake anyway.

PS - I am also trying Trazadone again, but it doesn't keep me asleep very long, and is too sedating to take in the middle of the night. Plus, its 'safe' long term use still means it's an antidepressant to taper off of, which is potentially worse IMO.",1765645225.0,3,2,insomnia,sleep
1plq4go,Neuro insomnia recovery,"Hi everyone,

Thought I’d use this opportunity to share my partial recovery with neurological insomnia. In 2020, I had a minor injury and started dealing with weird neurological issues like headaches, muscle twitching and pain. After a year of no answers, I also developed severe insomnia.

Essentially, I wouldn’t feel normal sleep pressure and I used to go a day or 2 without sleep but wouldn’t feel tired - only my neurological issues would worsen. When I did sleep, it was very light and not deep sleep. After trialling different medication, amitriptyline provided some relief, it allowed me to maintain sleep and my sleep was deeper but for years I couldn’t regain sleep pressure.

This all changed when I recently went on holiday and went swimming in a pool and in the sea. I went to bed expecting to not sleep, but strangely I felt tired and normal sleep pressure. I slept what felt like normal for the first time in YEARS and when I woke up I still felt tired, so I slept again. Normally when I woke up, regardless of hours slept I woke up feeling “wired” and unable to go back to sleep. 

I have now been swimming when I can and it has allowed me sleep normally during the night, although some of my neurological symptoms remain. This is still a partial recovery as I still can’t nap throughout the day and only fixed my sleep at night. Hoping one day I’ll be able to nap like before, I used to nap in the car, on the sofa, in my chair with ease… i miss it, but I’ll get back there one day. ",1765645035.0,4,4,insomnia,sleep

they even said that cold turkey is fine on 50mg, i even got a second opinion and they said the same thing. honestly i haven't had many effect besides head aches and brain fog. it actually helped me get in a better mental state after a break up. 

my first week was 25MG then the second week 50MG, my sleep went from 2-3 hours to 7-9 hours sometimes the drugs didn't work but mostly worked for the most part. my sleep went from 2-3 hours to 7-9 hours

but i realized if i go anything lower than 50 it seems to just not work at all. i wondered did my body adapt to this?

is it really ok to quit this stuff cold turkey? even after only taking it for 2 weeks

its been 2 days now of 2 hours of sleep each night. i did take the 45MG one night then the next 50Mg. im wondering if its cause im jumping around alot with it?

1pl5p5u,Severe Cannabis Induced Insomnia,"I was just diagnosed with this.  Finally a diagnosis that makes it all clear except what to do.  My psychiatrist says they think the heavy cannabis use damages the body’s sleep functions.

I’m 55 male and have been struggling with severe insomnia for over 3 years. Before sleep was rarely an issue. Severe stress at work made me turn to cannabis for sleep. At first it was just a few puffs and all was good.  Gradually got up to 50mg capsules and sometimes up to 200mg and often still didn’t work and would wake up often.

Got to the point where I was completely dysfunctional and some days I could barely stand up.  Tried other meds but none of them worked including trazadone (which made me sick and didn’t work), ambien 10mg, lunesta, quviviq, lorazepam, hydroxyzine, melatonin, magnesium glycinate and threonate, glycine, tryptophan, clonidine…. I’ve been recommended to try Seroquel but I’ve been scared to go there.

Tried many times going cold turkey and after 4 days of zero sleep, I couldn’t take it and went back to the cannabis.

Then I read that low testosterone can cause insomnia and my test showed I was on the low end 350-400, but not clinically low, but I also read that everyone is a little different on what level feels good.  I also learned that insomnia lowers testosterone production so it can be a vicious cycle.  Same with HGH, but I haven’t tested for that.

So I’ve been on TRT shots for about 3 months now and added enclomiphene to maintain my natural production.  At first I felt great and started sleeping 7-9 hours without waking up with 50mg of cannabis.  When I tried to reduce it to 25mg everything went haywire and going back to 50 didn’t help.  Testing came back and my Testaterone levels were off the charts over 1500+.  So I been reducing the testastrone and now sleeping about 6-7 hours with 50mg of cannabis.  Not as good as that first week, but I’m might need to lower it more as testing shows I’m still on the high end around 800-900.

That’s been stable now for a few weeks, but I still feel like crap. I think it’s because the cannabis induced sleep is poor quality and 6-7 hours of poor quality sleep is giving me any gains after years of not sleeping much.

So now I’m trying to figure out how to get off the cannabis.

I switched to a new psychiatrist, and she diagnosed me with Cannabis-Induced Insomnia which sounds exactly right.  Finally, a diagnosis that makes sense.

I believe this diagnosis it relatively new, and I bet there are a lot of people struggling with this.

So now with TRT my sleep is much better, but still bad.  Lorazepam used to not work by itself, but now I find that 2-3mg of lorazepam works well when it didn’t at all by itself.

So now do I stick with Lorazepam or Temazepam and trade one addiction for another, or try something else.  My shrink is recommending Hydroxizine, but I’m very skeptical it will work.  Other considerations are Seroquel, Quviviq, Ambien….  Longer term I want to be able to get off any one of those also.

Also considering checking into rehab to just force myself to detox, but it’s hard finding a place that knows how to address this issue specifically.

I feel like I’m back to square one and I feel so frustrated because I got out of it last time.

The thing I hate the most is just lying there in bed waiting for sleep to come. How can I not want sleep to come when I’m so tired? I’m having a hard time accepting it and not being attached to the outcome. I’m also confused if I should get out of bed or not when I’m frustrated because I can fall asleep on the couch just fine.

1pkz58m,CBN Gummies,"If you’re not the type to smoke or vape but still take CBN gummies or edibles, what is your experience like? Does tolerance go up to unsustainable levels? 

30mg of melatonin makes me a little drowsy after a while but I still wake up. Same with Unisom and Benadryl. 

My doctor won’t prescribe anything for me to take long term because it’s bad for me, but I work nights and live with my loud family. I’m always getting woken up. I’m desperate for something. I just recently started CBT-I but my dad constantly makes sounds that trigger my fight it flight (shoutout to r/misophonia), so I’m always in my room in bed which is against CBT-I rules. I need CBT for misophonia but I’m not even sure that’s a thing.

1pkw7i7,My CBT-I experience,"I am a couple months post CBT-I treatment and thought I would share my thoughts for others considering this treatment. I was hesitant at first due to the cost ($200 per hour for a psych PHD in my area). I had also dropped a decent chunk of change on hypnotherapy earlier in the year which didn't work for me but I kept seeing that CBT-I was the ""gold standard"" and I was at a point where I had tried pretty much everything. No matter what I did my insomnia always crept back in. I also smoked weed nightly for about 3.5 years which works until it doesn't. I quit weed a couple months before starting CBT-I.

  
The treatment itself is pretty simple. You restrict your sleep until you are sleeping at least 85% of the night. My first week I was supposed to sleep from 1am-6am. That would increase by 15 minute increments each week if I met the 85%. I'm not going to lie, it was AWFUL. I was exhausted and had at least 3 mental breakdowns. That being said, it was working because I was falling asleep as soon as I put my head on the pillow due to being so exhausted. I wanted to quit several times but pushed through. TBH the only reason I was able to do this is because I work remotely. I don't think I could have gone into the office in this state but who knows. There were also several days I went to bed a little earlier or slept in.

Even despite my skepticism, I have to say it worked. I'm now in bed from 10ishpm-6isham and I am pretty consistently sleeping through the night. I'm not awake all night long like I used to be. I definitely feel like the treatment helped retrain my brain to sleep when I'm in bed. For context, I would say my insomnia was pretty severe.  I was only getting like 1 decent night of sleep per week. The other nights I was fighting off panic attacks from the stress of not sleeping.

The other thing is that I don't really think you need a professional for this. Honestly I could have done it myself but it did kind of help to have someone tell me that the struggles I had in the beginning were normal and that the treatment was working.

I still will take 200mg of gabapentin periodically (maybe 1-2x per month) if I am particularly stressed about something or know I really need to sleep that night. But otherwise I am drug free. 

My final note is that I stopped wearing a watch to bed and never, ever look at the time at night. This might be common sense but thought I would put it in here.

After 4 nights of almost no sleep, my GP prescribed lormetazepam drops 0.7 mg for 2 weeks. It worked and i eventually stopped taking the meds.

Two weeks ago I got sick, couldn’t fall asleep until 5am, slept in the next day, and since then I keep sliding into a delayed schedule. I actually fixed it last week (good sleep, stopped meds midweek), but last Sunday it started again.

Current pattern: bed 11:30pm–12:30am, try to avoid meds at first.Then I repeat the same losing strategy: lie awake 1–2 hours → take lormetazepam (sometimes up to 1 mg) → it often doesn’t knock me out, just a weird sedated state where I open my eyes and see 2 hours passed (feels like shallow/useless sleep). Real vivid dreaming sleep usually starts 5:30am, then I sleep in 90 min chunks until 8:30/9:00. I’m very tired the next day.

Someone suggested I try a silk sleep mask because apparently blocking out ALL light (even the tiny LED from my phone charger) can help with sleep quality.

Before I spend money on this, I wanted to ask: does this actually work for anyone? Or is it just another thing the internet overhypes?

For context, my room is already pretty dark with blackout curtains, but there's still some light from street lamps outside and various electronics. I'm a really light sleeper so even small amounts of light wake me up.

Would love to hear if sleep masks have genuinely helped anyone, or if I'm just grasping at straws here. thanks

1pjvhfr,"Story of my insomnia I guess - I'm bad at naming things, can't think properly anyway :)","Hello everybody,

first of all, sorry in advance for occasional mistakes, typos and such, English isn’t my first language (it’s third actually).

I was looking around here for some time, gaining courage and energy to post my story here, and maybe ask for some advice, so here I am.



Recently I had my 1st anniversary with my sweet and beloved insomnia - yes, only one year, and already I feel like a trash. The worst is cognitive impairment, problems with memory, focus, and of course, physical reactions (besides exhaustion, problems with balance, headaches, different kinds of pains, and blah bla, y’all know what I’m talking about).

My, sadly, normal night is I’m trying to fall asleep for like 5-6 hrs (I go to bed every day at the same time), then I fall asleep in the morning for like 1-3 hrs, that’s all. As much as I try I always wake up at 9-9:30 am at the latest, mostly earlier. I can’t nap, never been able to. I feel tired in the evening, yawning and everything, I just can’t sleep. In time hypnic jerks occurred, now almost every night too, worsening it even more. I use earplugs, sleep mask, glasses to block blue light from screens. Right now I’m on ADs (fluvoxamine), bc I just couldn’t stand it any longer and I was very depressed during the day, not being able to do anything. Right now I am undergoing CBT therapy, but it’s good for nothing. These restrictive things never worked for me and only made my anxiety worse.



What I tried:

Meds:

trazodone (didn’t help and gave me the worst depression of my life)

mirtazapine (didn’t work and made me completely numb and emotionless)

promethazine (didn’t work)

zolpidem (put me to sleep for like 4 hrs, enormous grogginess and depression the next day, I didn't react well to that at all)

alprazolam (partially works, I take it sometimes)

cinolazepam (partially works, I take it sometimes) - but since the last two are benzos, I can’t take them every day or every other day.



Other stuff:

CBD (didn' t work, THC isn’t legal here)

herbs like lemon balm, passion flower, valerian root (they make me more calm, sometimes help a bit, but only occasionally)

melatonin (didn’t work)

all kind of vitamins or supplements (like vit D, b-complex, iron supplement,...), magnesium (I literally tried every possible form available on the market, never worked), electrolytes

l-theanine (calms me a bit), glycine (didn’t work), taurine (didn’t work), ashwagandha (didn’t work), you name it, I tried it all.



Docs and examinations:

This is hard, bc docs here are pretty benevolent and not very knowledgeable, it’s pretty hard to have them run some basic test at least, most of them don’t even speak English and have no idea what to do (middle Europe here), but I’ve been to:

endocrinologist - she was mocking me from the moment I mentioned I have problems with sleep, but at least ran some tests for thyroid hormones - all are ok (her advice was to “have a walk before bed”)

gynecologist - full hormone profile, he said everything’s ok

neurologist - this is tragedy on itself, the only advice the first one gave me was to take magnesium, the other one at least ran some tests (emg and eeg negative), but he ended it with information he can’t help me and I should “draw energy from the space” (quoting here), now I’m searching for another one, but tbh I have no energy left for this.

We don’t have a functional doc here, there are two sleep labs but they only focus on sleep apnea and nothing else.

They didn’t even want to do some basic blood test, so I went and paid for it myself, vitamins, minerals, iron and stuff, everything’s within the range.



Sometimes some supplement works one, two times, then stop. I wasn’t able to connect my insomnia with anything - food, water, fucking moon phases or weather, it’s just…is. 

I’m at wits end of what to do, what to try. This night I slept for 2 hrs and barely see and think. I feel like I’m slowly falling apart.

So, just my rant I guess :) And maybe asking for some advice, support, anything. Every response will be greatly appreciated.

Thank you and I wish you all a lot of strength and healthy sleep :)

1pjs3pc,exhausted,"im at my breaking point. ive had insomnia for years, but these past few months have been hell. im so tired i could cry and i actually am crying as i write this.

every day i think about how many hours i have left to sleep before work, and that anxiety just keeps me awake even more. i try to calm down, i try to force myself to sleep, but my body just refuses. my eyes hurt because im obviously so sleepy, but i can’t fall asleep no matter what i do. it feels like torture.

and when i try to sleep, i get this horrible sensory overload where I can literally feel everything, every sound, every toes of mine, my heartbeat, my breathing, hairs on all of my body, and it makes me want to crawl out of my skin. i hate it SO SO much.

and when i fall asleep, i bolt awake every 15–20 minutes with my heart racing like something is wrong. ot feels awful and scary and then i can’t fall back asleep again. im left lying there in the dark, exhausted and frustrated and just… done.

im so tired. im so mentally and physically drained. i just want to sleep like a normal person. im so sick of this.

whenever i try to tell this to my family, they would just simply tell me to ""force yourself to sleep"" AS IF im not doing that. im so sick of this. I JUST WANT TO SLEEP. ",1765440219.0,3,3,insomnia,sleep

1pjez20,Alzheimer's may be linked to disturbances in the sleep-wake cycle,"Alzheimer's disease significantly disrupts daily routines, with symptoms such as sleep disturbances and increased confusion during the evening hours, known as ""sundowning."" Recent research from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis has shed light on the intricate relationship between Alzheimer's disease and circadian rhythms—the body's internal clock that regulates sleep and other biological cycles.

The study, published in *Nature Neuroscience* on October 23, reveals that Alzheimer's disrupts circadian rhythms within specific brain cells, which in turn affects the expression patterns of hundreds of genes critical for brain function. Lead researcher Dr. Erik S. Musiek noted that approximately half of the 82 genes linked to Alzheimer's risk are influenced by circadian rhythms. In mice engineered to exhibit Alzheimer’s-like symptoms, these genes failed to maintain their normal daily activity patterns.

Disruptions in sleep, a common issue for caregivers of Alzheimer’s patients, may exacerbate the disease's progression. Musiek pointed out that disturbances in sleep can begin years before cognitive decline is apparent, leading to increased stress for both patients and caregivers.

The research team monitored gene activity in mice with amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's, over a 24-hour period. They found that amyloid deposits significantly disrupted the normal rhythms of genes in microglia and astrocytes—two types of brain cells essential for waste clearance and neuronal communication.

The findings suggest that therapies aimed at stabilizing circadian rhythms in these cell types may offer new avenues for treatment. Musiek emphasized the potential for manipulating the circadian system to mitigate amyloid accumulation and other Alzheimer’s-related issues, although further research is needed to fully explore this approach. The study received funding from several National Institutes of Health agencies, although the authors clarified that the content does not necessarily reflect the agencies' official views.",1765401738.0,5,0,insomnia,sleep

1pjaxt0,I've had a sleeping problem for years now and I have no idea what's causing it or what it is,"For as long as I can remember I've had a sleeping problem. When I was a young kid my mum put me to sleep at 7pm and had me wake 7am, if I didn't have a 12/12 cycle I was a behavioural nightmare. She stopped this for reasons when I was about 9ish and ever since I woke multiple times throughout the night, couldn't sleep through the night and have never had a refreshing sleep. When I was a teen it got worse, it became even more harder to fall asleep on top of it, meaning I was awake on school nights till like 2-3 am, but once I finally fell asleep I would sleep for 10-12 hours, still waking throughout the night but to tired to get up till I had the 10-12 hrs. When I was about 17 it got even worse and I started having monthly ish cycles of normal sleep times, awake for half the day and night, then awake all night and slept through the day then the other half of the day and night till I was back to normal sleep times. Now its fairly normal to have 24-30 hours awake before falling asleep. I seem to need to be awake for about 20 hrs before feeling tired and even then its hard to sleep unless I'm so physically tired I can't stay awake, then I sleep for 12 hours, waking multiple times to move because I'm sore (chronic pain).
Since Monday to now (thursday at almost 5 am cause I'm in Australia) I've slept a combined total 7-8 hrs if sleep beacause i can't sleep and have commitments throughout the day.

1pj7e61,Unraveling Insomnia: The Sleep Thief of the Night,"Lying in bed for hours with a carousel of thoughts galloping through my mind is a familiar part of my routine now. Each night becomes a battle against the clock, an unwilling game of patient waiting. Outside, the night deepens, silence envelops the world, and seemingly everyone is in their blissful state of rest. Only my mind continues to race, caught in its endless loop, stubbornly resistant to the sweet surrender of sleep. 

Insomnia, my subtle enemy, crept into my life unnoticed. Its presence wasn't heralded by drama, no solemn doctor's diagnosis or sudden awakening in the dead of night. It was a gradual process, a slow shift. Started with a few sleepless nights here and there, which soon braided into weeks, and before I knew it, my intimacy with sleep felt like a distant memory. The moonlight became my constant companion, casting long, lonely shadows throughout my room while the world around me slipped into serenity.

It's unnerving, the solitude of it. To have this buffet of thoughts served solely to you, while the world dreams blissfully ignorant. Sleep has become this foreign land, a realm I can peep into but can't access. I wonder often if insomnia is a lonely wanderer, looking for minds to inhabit, or is it the mischievous imp, summoned by our own lifestyles, worries, and habits?

Does anyone else feel a strange camaraderie with the night, watching the stars glance back as we fail to shroud our thoughts? Have you mustered any tricks to tame this wild beast, or like me, are you still learning to coexist?",1765384939.0,2,0,insomnia,sleep

My doc switched Quietiapine to Risperidone (1mg) and added 75mg of Effexor at noon.

Ever since then, however, I've been waking up between 4-5 am every morning and unable to fall back asleep. I am absolutely wrecked from fatigue.

I called her and we decided to go back to Quietiapine. However, I read that Effexor also affects sleep, especially with a higher dose and later on in the day. I also read that missing as little as one dose can lead to withdrawal that can by itself lead to waking up during the night, though.

I want to do anything I can to sleep through the night tonight. So my logical thought was to skip Effexor and take Quietiapine. But now I'm not sure if that's a good idea since I've read the withdrawal could lead to waking up. But taking it may also lead to waking up!

1piwvq4,My insomnia is not falling asleep – it’s waking up at 2–3 AM every night (Daridorexant experience + allergies + CPAP),"Hi everyone, I want to share a bit more about my sleep problems because my situation is a bit different from the usual insomnia cases here.

I fall asleep very fast — usually within 2–3 minutes.

My real problem is **sleep maintenance**, not sleep onset.

For more than 30 years I have been waking up at **2–3 AM** almost every night. Sometimes I wake with headaches, sometimes with nasal blockage, sometimes with asthma, and sometimes for no clear reason. I can fall asleep again, but the whole night becomes fragmented.

My allergy test showed I have **dust mite allergy Level 5**.

For a long time I only took loratadine. Later an older doctor suggested **Montelukast**, which helped a bit and made my awakenings slightly later.

I also have sinusitis and had balloon sinuplasty 10 years ago. It helped my frontal headaches, but I still have left temporal pain and nighttime awakenings.

I use CPAP (ResMed). It improved my breathing but I still often slept only 3–4 hours in total.

Recently I started **Daridorexant**. I’ve only taken it for about a week, but it helps me sleep until **5–6 AM**, which is amazing for me.

50 mg is too strong for me, but **25 mg feels just right**. I do dream more, but the night feels calmer and I don’t wake up gasping anymore.

I will keep updating my experience in case it helps someone who also struggles with nighttime awakenings instead of sleep onset issues.

So I went back and spoke to the doctor again. She suggested I speak to the psychiatric nurse.

I spoke to the nurse. She asked if I had tried their antipsychotic medication for sleep. I said I don’t want to take those because they’re off-label. I asked if I could try an orexin blocker instead  a medication actually designed for sleep, unlike the off-label options.

They got back to me with a full report saying the patient must be assessed for autism spectrum disorder and ADHD because I refused the antipsychotic for sleep. I also do not have autism I’ve slept fine for 34 years. Maybe this is stress-related, but who cares? Have they even considered all the antihistamines I’ve tried for sleep?

I honestly feel the health system in New Zealand is frustrating I can only imagine what it’s like elsewhere.

And yet, they can prescribe benzodiazepines easily, then warn “don’t take them long-term.” I already know that, which is why I want an orexin blocker. But apparently, they are not going to approve it.

Broad overview of my insomnia journey-got terrible insomnia from working graveyard shift combined with an intense exercise regimen. The classics-4 hours of sleep became a good day, hours laying in bed, frequent waking when actually able to fall asleep. My particular version came with the added bonus of high blood pressure (~160/100, 90 BPM RHR) at its worst, and my fingers frequently falling asleep while awake. I was very active with martial arts training and had passed physical tests for SERE training with the military, 6’1 ~190. 

My insomnia lasted a little over three years. During that time I would make progress and hit walls. Feel like I was making progress only to be hit with a night of no sleep seemingly randomly. At this point, I feel like I’ve defeated my insomnia-I have a sleep drive again (ie I actually get tired again), I fall asleep within minutes of laying down for bed, and I’m able to stay asleep (exception being when my newborn wakes me up 🙃). 

The docs told me all the classic things you see on this sub-but it’s mostly BS. I look at my phone before bed, I’m stretched more thin (workload is higher, and have a 4 month old as previously mentioned), my physical fitness has not dramatically shifted. Yet, I’m sleeping better than ever in years. 

From lurking and reading plenty of others people’s stories, I’m emphatically of the opinion that chronic insomnia is purely a metabolic problem/deficiency. 

“But my blood tests come back normal!” 

A blood test is not always representative of where the problem may be occurring. A good example is iron-you may have normal blood iron levels, but that is not representative of what iron is available in your brain or other tissues. Your body prioritizes serum levels of micronutrients over almost anything else. 

My journey involved a lot of experimentation with supplements/foods/etc, but I’m unwaveringly convinced that it’s the path back to robust, restorative sleep. ",1765322144.0,0,9,insomnia,sleep

I’m not really sure how much time I spent asleep or awake; all I know is that I entered a state where I felt conscious, and could definitely hear things that were happening in the room, and have my own thoughts, but it felt as though my limbs were being dragged down into the bed, and this weird, almost panicky euphoria kept sending whooshing, tingling sensations down from my chest into my arms. I felt as though I snuck up on sleep several times, even though I have no idea whether I actually got there (maybe a few microsleeps?); when I got up, I did feel somewhat rested by comparison to my absolute exhaustion that morning.

Has anybody had experiences remotely like this? Like, what *was* that? It felt good, so I’m not questioning it too much, but I’d give anything to have been wearing an EEG.

Anything at all that you can say is welcome. Hope this isn’t too weird of a ramble. Cheers.",1765318896.0,5,8,insomnia,sleep
1pihg92,Insomnia - The Unwanted Night Companion,"The nightly ordeal with insomnia is a peculiar one. Before I know it, the clock strikes 2 AM and I'm still staring at the ceiling, straining to embrace sleep that seems to be eluding me. You know, there's something about the quiet of the late night, the soft hum of the AC, the faint glow from the street lamp seeping into the room; they all seem to create this inverse lullaby where my thoughts only get louder, bouncing around in the silence.

This isn't a one-off event, but rather a persistent visitor that decided to take up permanent residence in my life. Sometimes these wide-awake instances are filled with productive thoughts - a sudden clarity or renewed perspective about something that puzzled me during the day. But most times, they're not. It's a carousel of something someone said, mundane tasks I've been neglecting, or complex dilemmas with no easy solutions.

All while the night moves at its own unbothered pace, dawn breaking only when I’ve finally given in to the terrifying thought that today might be another day lived on zero sleep. And yet, when the world is shut off and succumbs to the night, there's a strange tranquility in those moments of solitude.

So tell me, are there any ways that help you manage this intrusive guest of insomnia? How do you make sense of those long sleepless nights?",1765310202.0,3,1,insomnia,sleep

1pig1s3,Could this be restless leg syndrom?,"Ill have a strange energy in my mind and body when I lie down and i just know im not gonna be able to fall asleep. My body but specifically my legs will feel super hot even when its not hot and ill have to sleep with minimal sheets touching me. Usually my warm plush sheets feel so good on my legs but when this is happening they feel awful and only the coolness of the outersheets feels good but it only last for seconds before its warm and uncomfortable. Its also is hard for my legs and hips to feel comfortable. I'll also have to pee alot.

The worst part is that once i finally get comfortable and close my eyes and start to feel sleepy I get concentrated points of an itchy burning sensation under my skin. They could be anywhere on my body but most often on my legs. I could scratch a point and it could not help at all or if it does help another itchy point quickly shows up somewhere else. It drives me crazy because I can just try to ignore it but its like the exact amount of itchiness that Its impossible to ignore enough for my brains to fall asleep. There's no rashes or bump where it itches at all and it's exactly like when the palm of your hand itches and you cant scratch it but all over my body.

This was happening to me for months last winter and it had me suicidal not sleeping and missing work. It stopped once warmed up. it happened again randomly last night and I missed work today and feel stupid for It. I cant have another winter long episode of this shit again I just won't be ok.

Last night I took zero supplements (no melatonin, no magnesium) and I played on my 3DS right before bed. Once I was in bed ready to sleep, the second I felt myself trying to sleep my brain would fight it.

1pi6fm5,Is this how Zolpidem is supposed to 'feel'?,"The past two nights I have tried Zolpidem.  The first night I took 5mg.  I put my phone away, put my head down, and just tried to fall asleep.  After a while I felt absolutely no difference so I checked the time and 30 minutes had passed.  I went back to trying to sleep and I guess I ended up falling asleep.  I woke up a couple times throughout the night but was able to go back to sleep every time.  I ended up sleeping around 7 hours which is great.  I woke up feeling as if I hadn't taken anything at all.  I just felt like my normal self.  I started to question if the pill actually had any effect on me at all.

  
So then last night I decided to take a full pill, 10mg.  Once again I felt nothing after taking the pill and I checked my phone and 40 minutes had passed.  After that I fell asleep.  Woke up 3 times but still ended up getting 6-7 hours of sleep.  I woke up again feeling like I hadn't even taken anything.

  
Is it normal to not feel any effect mentally at all from Zolpidem?  I expected to feel some sort of drowsiness.  I haven't suffered any memory loss or anything either.  It's like the pill just magically puts me to sleep after about an hour.  I keep waiting for it to 'kick in' but I guess it doesn't do that in a noticeable way?  How am I supposed to know if I should take 5mg vs. 10mg if I can't really notice its effects and they both had similar results?",1765284148.0,1,4,insomnia,sleep

It got better in my mid-late 20s, but when I got a job working PST hours (i’m in EST), my sleep schedule became even more messed up and been having issues since then.

I got a new job last year and I’m back to doing 9-5, but I have had horrible sleep. I cannot for the life of me maintain a solid 7-8 hour sleep if I sleep before 3-4 AM.

1pi36s3,My story of my world going upside down and coming back up better than ever in the span of a month.,"I am writing here in the hopes of helping someone who is scared, bewildered, and feeling hopeless. This is specifically intended for people who have recently fallen into the insomnia hell, and not towards people who have been struggling with it for years. This might help someone like that but I am not in a space to understand the emotions and difficulties of someone like that at this point. But for someone who recently fell into  this, this might help you in understanding what is happening, and ways to make it get better.

  
So I am a healthy young male, who works out, has a good job, and a lovely partner. I am, however, a person who has always struggled with anxiety and stress. But never so bad that I had to work on it. Health anxiety is something that I have carried with me forever, one of the main reasons I workout. So this is my story of how I fell and got back up. I will mention the things that I did and how effective they were so you may not make the mistakes I did or if you do make them, understand that it is still possible to move forward from it. TL:DR; at the bottom.

  
It started about a month and a half ago, I bought a new health tracker watch to monitor my workouts and other health related stuff. It was good at first, I was tracking my workouts and sleep. I had good sleep patterns at that point, regular sleeping and waking times, good sleep hygiene, like no screens, dim lights no heavy food before bed etc. But a week later, I did some extensive cardio in the evening, which left me in this hyper aroused mode at night. I went to bed and no shit, I couldn't sleep. I was awake in the bed until 5am, whereas my usual sleeping time is 11 pm. And my watch told me I had a poor sleep. It started the cycle in me. Now I wanted better sleep. A desire to sleep more or to be precise, a desire to control sleep awoke inside me. But the next day was normal, I slept. But then the next week, I still did cardio late into the evening, not understanding what caused the issue last week, and alas, I couldn't  sleep again. This started the next round of confusions and questioning. What is happening? why is it happening? I kept wondering until I found that my evening cardio is the culprit. That kind of helped me calm down a bit. And I slept the next day because of exhaustion mostly. But the day after, I went to bed at 11pm, but I was not really sleepy. I just wanted to make sure I get my 8 hours and have a good sleep score on my watch. But going to bed not being sleepy, made me stay awake for a while and then the anxiety of not being able to sleep kicked in. I didn't sleep again. Now I am completely scared. I have had issues with sleep before but never so that I had multiple sleepless nights in a week. That is when the next part of the journey started.

  
I went to a general practitioner, and they told me it is okay. They told me to take some melatonin and gave me an Oxazepam pill to be taken only if needed. It is an anxiety medication for those who don't know about it. I was not very happy but I went on. I took melatonin that night, and was able to sleep well. The next week, I slept well, and continued to take melatonin for one week. My life was back to normal, and I was working out and doing the shit that I love. I also started meditation and journaling. So life was good until the Monday next week, where I had a small GERD flare up at night, which awoke me and put me in a state of hyper arousal. So obviously I couldn't sleep later on. At first I thought I will just try to sleep and not take any medication. But at about 3AM, I caved and took some melatonin. But that didn't do anything, and I was wide awake at 4AM. So I took the anxiety pill(which I didn't know at the time was an anxiety pill). I thought it ought to put me to sleep immediately. But that's not how it works. I took another hour to go to sleep. 

This is when the big bad happened. I started to think that the issue I have is an incurable one with no medication that can put me to sleep. And worse, the night after, which has always been a night I can sleep well, I was not able to sleep. Not even from exhaustion. And the main reason for that was my incredible desire to sleep and all the things I tried to control before sleep. I even took a bit of CBD oil along with my melatonin. And when I hit the bed feeling really sleepy, a small thought of ""what if I can't sleep tonight?"" left me in a extremely hyper aroused state. I had my first panic attack, my body was filling with adrenaline, waves of hot and cold flashes across my body, heart  beating at such a high rate I thought I was dying. My partner calmed me down enough but I was not able to sleep. I decided not to take the anxiety pill because I thought if I took two in a row, I am beyond curable.

At this point, I was working on a fun and challenging task in my job, and I was so afraid it was gonna affect my work. I was thinking of scenarios like getting fired because I can't keep up or because I fuck up something while being a walking zombie. But I went for some therapy. It was good in a way that I understood how my life has revolved around anxiety and stress but not well enough to understand what was going on with my sleep. I understood that anxiety was something that was causing the issue. But to me now anxiety is something to get rid off. I have to make sure I am not anxious at all. But it doesn't work like that. But an anxiety course in insight timer told me to treat my anxiety like a scared little animal that needs care. Which helped me the following night, where I told myself that it is okay to be scared and I am here for myself, and that calmed me down enough to sleep. And I was relieved, I felt like I found the cure. I am rid of anxiety. This ignorance helped me sleep for three more days straight. Until another event took place where a sudden short lived pain in my ribs caused me to wake up from sleep and get put into a hyper aroused state. And thus started the final part of my downhill spiral.

 I tried the telling myself the ""I am okay"" thing. But after a couple of hours, I started to not believe myself when I was telling myself that. But I remained confident. But no sleep, and it was already 7AM, my usual waking time. So I decided to not sleep at all. I thought I will stay awake through the day, as it was a Sunday. I was pretty okay during the day, and I did everything that chatgpt told me to do to get the best chances of sleeping that night. I browsed so much time in reddit looking at stuff in this sub and other subs. But I told myself, and chagpt told me that I don't have insomnia, and I will be back to normal in a couple of days. Well guess what, all this preparation put an insane amount of desire to sleep in me. And when I went to bed, exhausted, and sleepy af, I  thought I am gonna sleep like a baby. I could feel myself drifting. And then came the monster. Hypnic jerk, or hypnic awareness. The first one was a jerk. I heard a popping sound in my head as I was drifting, and I became fully aware and awoke. But I didn't mind. I thought it was weird but then it happened again. This time I was fully awake, and felt anxiety and adrenaline rush through me. I was hyper aroused again. It felt like all my exhaustion and sleepiness was completely gone. Now I truly believed I was broken. I felt like my life as I know it is done. I took the anxiety pill and it calmed me down enough to sleep. But the day after, I was in a terrible state. I was at work but I was anxious all the time. I was physically feeling terrible. I again went to the therapist and they told me that what I am experiencing is just my inability to let go. So if I let go, I will not get those jerks. I tried doing that at night the same day. But as you can imagine, at this point I am fully hyper aroused from my desire to sleep and my anxiety of sleep. Bed was a hell for me. Going to bed, and thinking of bed made me feel horrified. But I still went to bed, telling myself to let go. Guess what, I couldn't let go. I kept getting the hypnic jerks and hypnic  awareness through out the night. Not a single bit of sleep. I was horrified, thinking suicidal thoughts, and just feeling like it is all over for me. I took the day off from work and went to a doctor again. They gave me Zolpidem for the night and a referral to a psychiatrist. This is where it started to get better.



The psychiatrist told me one thing with a smiling face, ""I can't promise you that I can fix it for you nor can you fix it"". I was angry at them. But they prescribed Mirtazapine for me, and asked me to read a book called ""Don't feed the monkey mind"". They also asked me to take the week off from work. At the same time I read a couple of posts here which pointed me towards ""The Sleep Coach"" in Youtube. And finally accepted one thing, I am not going back to the way it was. And I have issues with sleep that might be with me forever. And thus began the process of my healing. The first thigh I addressed was my anxiety. The book gave me a huge insight to it. It was the art of letting anxiety be. Not just accepting it but taking it on. Almost like getting punched in your face and asking for more. As I was not working, I had plenty of time to think about it. But it was not a magical fix. I was anxious most of the time, and I was taking zolpidem for two nights. But that felt like shit, and it felt really bad the day after. Then the next day, I took Mirtazapine at night. I took a quarter of a 15mg pill. So it was not too strong but I slept well. I did this for 8 days, so two pills. And I was sleeping well every day. And during this time, I read the whole book, and watched a lot of the videos from the Sleep coach. I also read the book Set it and forget it from the same person. I will write a couple of points which the sleep coach mentioned but do go after the channel and watch if you have read this until now.

  
First thing was to befriend wakefulness. This was a difficult concept. What does it mean? It literally mean to be not sad that you are awake, instead do the things you wanna do when you are awake. I was still on Mirtazapine when i went through this. I was still able to sleep but I started to think of ways I can befriend my wakefulness. Something I did was to arrange midnight snacks when i got hungry during sleepless nights, and planning ahead on what I am going to do if I am not sleeping. Like the book I am going to read or the show that I am going to watch. But like I said, I was still on Mirtazapine and didn't know if this will work. 

  
The second thing was the gas and the brake model of sleep. The gas is wakefulness, and the brake is hyper arousal. Nothing else matters. So I stayed awake and did everything I wanted to do through the day and hoped hyper arousal doesn't come. Which didn't come when on Mirtazapine. But I was back to work, and I was back on track with everything including working out. And then after 8 days, I stopped Mirtazapine, which as you can imagine, caused some worries in me. I still had my plans for the night, my snacks too. And when I was in bed, the hypnic jerks came in. One thing with that is that, the hypnic jerks and hypnic awareness are things you cannot control, just like sleep. But you can control how you react to them. If you react gently, with acceptance and acknowledgement, they will stop by themselves. But you can't force stop them. With this method, even after not taking any medication, I slept without staying awake for a long period of time. And this kept on going for the next two weeks. 

But after 3 weeks of straight sleep, my partner was going away for a work related task and I would be alone for a while. This caused anxiety and the hyper arousal that came with it. This caused me to have a full night of little sleep. But this time, I was always in bed. Even though I was not sleeping, or micro sleeping, I didn't get up from bed other than a couple of times to eat my snacks. I enjoyed being in bed and just relaxing. I was not panicking nor was I spiraling. I just let the anxiety and stress and all the physical symptoms just run through me. I felt like this was a great opportunity for me to learn and implement the things that I have learned. When the alarm rang, I was awake. But I got up, no anger or sadness in me, I started to work, had a cup of coffee, and also went to the gym, even though I first thought it might be a bd idea. I actually had PR in the gym on the night I slept very little. This reinforced the idea that even if I don't sleep nothing is gonna happen to me. I can live my life to the fullest. And since that day, for the last 4 days, I have been sleeping well every night. I still get hypnic jerks and hypnic awareness, but I don't react to them. I just let it be. And when I hit the bed, I expect nothing other than just enjoying the comfort of my bed. And I present no resistance to my thoughts. If they are anxious thoughts, I let it be. If they are thoughts about hypnic jerks and hypnic awareness and hyper arousal, I let it be. Because no resistance means they go by. Not getting attached to the outcome means, you don't expect anything other than love the process. And the process is comfort. 

This journey helped me process anxiety and other bad yet normal human emotions in my day to day life. My partner told me I have become much more calmer and positive through out my days. It is not that I don't get any bad emotion but rather I let it take me when it comes. I offer no resistance to my bad emotions. I am truly a better human now and I am grateful that this happened to me. 

 I was not planning to write this long but when I started writing I felt everything about my journey was important.

  
TL:DR;

\-> At first the desire started when I wanted to get better sleep. This then made me lose sleep. 

\-> But I kept on looking at things to blame for sleeplessness, and started to fix them one by one. 

\-> But every time I fixed something, something else broke, reinforcing that something fundamentally was broken with me. 

\-> But my issue is not unique. It is just a constant state of hyper arousal. The hyper arousal goes when you stop resisting. 

\-> Accepting and welcoming anxiety, in this case the sleep anxiety, will make it run its course and leave. 

\-> This will however mean that you might need to sacrifice sleep for a day or two. Deciding to go through your life even when you have a sleepless night will reinforce the idea you can still have a fun life without sleep. 

\-> React gently to what happens, take a step back and let your emotions run slow through you.

\-> This whole process, even though might feel like hell, it will make you a better person. And better at handling other day to day life issues better.

\-> The Sleep Coach on youtube and  the book ""Don't feed the monkey mind"" are your friends in this journey

\-> The process will take time. And even then there will be days when you lose sleep because of stress or other issues but you will be better prepared to handle it. And you will never go back to the place before this happened because you will be better than you were before.

\-> Medications are not bad if you wanna get a grip on life but they are never permanent solutions and you should be ready to get rid of medications and take on the life without medications .

1pi1hho,a small morning habit that surprisingly helped my sleep at night,"i have dealt with bad sleep for years. not just the actual insomnia at night, but the weird cycle it creates the next morning. i would wake up feeling exhausted, reach for my phone immediately, and start scrolling in bed because i did not have the energy to get up. it felt harmless, but over time my sleep got even worse. i would be wired at night, tired in the morning, and always stuck in this fog that never seemed to lift.

one day i came across something from Dr Andrew Huberman about how your circadian rhythm literally depends on getting real sunlight in your eyes shortly after waking. not through a window and not from your phone, but actual outdoor light. apparently those specific wavelengths of morning light trigger a rise in cortisol at the right time of day, which then helps your melatonin cycle reset at night. basically, morning sunlight tells your brain when the day starts so it can know when the day ends.

i had never heard that in my life.

so i tested it. i told myself no scrolling in bed, and instead i would step outside for two or three minutes as soon as i woke up. the first few days felt awful because my brain wanted the easy dopamine from my phone. but something strange happened after a week. i was feeling slightly clearer in the morning. less fuzzy. and at night i noticed i was getting sleepy closer to a normal bedtime instead of lying there wide awake with my thoughts racing.

i am not saying it cured my insomnia, but it genuinely helped more than anything else i had tried. even on cloudy mornings that natural light still counts. it feels like such a small thing but it has made my nights calmer and my mornings less chaotic.

1phz6kn,Chatgpt says trazedone is not safe to combine with Mucinex is that true?,"Here is the response from AI:

Short answer: You should not combine Mucinex Multi-Action with trazodone without medical guidance.

Here’s why:

⚠️ Why the combination can be dangerous

Most Mucinex Multi-Action or Mucinex DM/Cold & Flu products contain dextromethorphan (DXM) and/or phenylephrine.
These can interact with trazodone in two important ways:

1. Risk of Serotonin Syndrome (major concern)

Trazodone increases serotonin.
Dextromethorphan (found in Mucinex DM, Multi-Symptom, Cold & Flu, etc.) also increases serotonin.

Together, they can cause serotonin syndrome, which can be dangerous.

Symptoms include:

Agitation, confusion

Sweating, shivering

Rapid heart rate

High blood pressure

Muscle twitching or rigidity

Dilated pupils

Fever


2. Increased sedation

Trazodone is sedating. Some Mucinex formulations (especially with antihistamines) also cause drowsiness → more dizziness, slowed reaction, and risk of respiratory depression, especially if you use cannabis, opioids, alcohol, or stimulants.

✔️ Safe alternative

If your Mucinex is plain Mucinex (guaifenesin only) — NOT “DM”, not “Multi-Action”, not “Severe Cold”, not “Max Strength”, not “NightShift” — then it is safe with trazodone.

But Mucinex Multi-Action = unsafe combo because it contains DXM and other actives.

I still have sleep issues if some person gives me stress. 90% of my problems in life were because of people. I now interact with people mostly when it's necessary and don't talk more than necessary.

I have slept like 4 hours/night for a year and I can't do this anymore its torture. It doesnt matter how tired I am, my body doesnt let me relax. I fall asleep and sleep like two hours and then I wake up in panic and have a hard time falling asleep again, If Im lucky I fall asleep for another two hours and thats it. 

Before this happened I have never had trouble sleeping, I love to sleep and need atleast 9-10 hours sleep. 

The sleep deprivation has wrecked me mentally and physically, I feel sick, I have pain in my body due to the lack of rest. I just exist in panic all day, stuck in fight or flight all day long. I have'nt had one second in this year when I feel relaxed and safe, its torture not being able to sleep when thats the only thing I want to do.. My life has fallen apart and I don’t have the energy to do anything. My life is just a nightmare state to be in.

I have tried sleeping over at friends to get rest away from the stressor(the bugs) but the stress follows me everywhere and I can't sleep even if I am in a bug free home. It feels like I can't run from this feeling.. 
I am in contact with doctors but they say they don't know what to do if the meds don't work..I've tried even the strongest of sleeping pills but they dont work, besides the meds I've tried expensive sleeping supplements, breathing exercises, hypnosis, meditation, and so on, but I know its the bed bugs that gives me so strong stress I can't sleep, I can’t wait for the bed bugs to be gone before getting my sleep back. My reaction to the bugs is a bigger health issue than the actual bugs, but Its like my body tells me Im in danger and can't relax.

I don't really know where else to turn at this point.

I've been dealing with this thing where I fall asleep fine around 11pm, but then like clockwork, I wake up around 2:30 or 3am.

And then I just... lay there.

Sometimes for an hour. Sometimes for two.

My doctor keeps saying ""you're getting 7 hours, that's fine."" But it doesn't feel fine.

My mom had early memory issues in her 60s and honestly, that scares the hell out of me.

I'm tired during the day. I forget things more than I used to. And when I bring it up, people just say ""oh everyone forgets things"" or ""you just need to relax more.""

But it's not that simple.

I've tried:

* Melatonin (works for like 2 hours then I'm awake again)
* Sleep tea (helps me fall asleep but not stay asleep)
* No screens before bed (still wake up)
* Exercise (still wake up)
* Meditation apps (still wake up)

I feel like I'm doing everything ""right"" but my body just won't stay asleep.

And the worst part? Everyone acts like it's no big deal.

""Just go back to sleep."" Yeah, I'm trying.

""At least you're getting some sleep."" But it feels broken.

""Stop worrying about it so much."" But what if there's something actually wrong?

I guess I'm writing this because I feel really alone in this.

Does anyone else deal with this?

How do you cope with doctors or family members who don't take it seriously?

Do you worry about what this means for your brain long-term?

1phemca,Eye twitching,"Hi everyone,

I’ve had a diagnosis of mixed parasomnia since I was very young, so I don’t experience typical sleep cycles. The sleep I do get is usually extremely restless.

As this has always been my norm, I’ve learned to live with it. However, I do go through periods of more pronounced insomnia. For the past five months, I’ve been dealing with a high-stress situation, and some weeks my sleep has averaged only 2-4 hours a night (my usual is somewhere between 3-6).

Over the last week, I’ve been getting maybe 3 or 4 hours. During high stress, this often happens and is usually accompanied by a twitch in my left eye. By that, I mean when I’m awake, my eye twitches involuntarily throughout the day with varying frequency.

Lately, during this stressful and sleepless period, I’ve started experiencing the same twitching in my right eye, too. This is new as, for some reason, it was always only my left before.

I’m just curious if anyone else experiences this during bad bouts of insomnia? I’m aware it’s a common stress and high-cortisol response to sleep deprivation. I use Hycosan eye drops (suggested by my optometrist), which helps for a while. There’s not much point in seeing my GP, as the cause is clear and there’s not much to be done. I’m purely interested in hearing if others get this eye twitching when their insomnia is particularly bad.

I was scared of the side effects,  especially the potential for gyno, but even then i could sleep just fine. Had one midnight wake up, but other than that no problem. Then my grandfather got hospitalised, we had to drive from home to the hospital multiple times, but then i woke up in the middle of the night, like 4 am, not feeling tired at all. At that point i took it for about 3 weeks. I thought it strange at the time but nothing more. But suddendly, i just could not fall asleep anymore. Everytime i gone to bed i would just not feel tired at all. And that persisted. I didn't know what caused it, so i tried things like sleep hygiene, melatonin magnesium, nothing helped. Then i googled about if Fin could cause it and there were anecdotes on the internet but on the official pamphlet there was no mention of sleep disturbances as a side effect, so i kept taking it. But it never got better, i only got more and more suicidal, my head and thoughts spinning, balding and lack of sleep all being on my mind. 
I am off the meds now for like 2 months, and it barely got better in regards to sleep, i get decent sleep maybe every 2 or 3 days, with poor or no sleep at all on the rest. I think it is mainly psychological, because i have a history of OCD and overthinking anxiety, plus my horrible smartphone addiction and me just googling every symptom i put my self in a bad headspace.

It's almost 6am here, another sleepless night and the school run starts in a little over an hour. 😭

I've got ADHD, when I got the diagnosis it actually helped with my lifelong insomnia as my GP prescribed melatonin. That worked for 3 years, until this year when I underwent chemotherapy for a brain tumor. This meant I also had to take a nasty steroid called dexamethasone which wrecked my sleep again. 5 months down the line I'm back to square 1, despite eating super healthily, and exercising every day.

1pgutct,Feeling of Being Watched During Sleep,"I have had this issue my whole life and I can't find any clinical psychology terminology to help me understand or reconcile it. It has made treatment near impossible. I am hoping someone has a name for this:  
\-Once it starts to get dark I get a generalized paranoid feeling of being watched

\-I can't sleep because of the feeling of being watched

\-I can not ignore it since it compounds and I freak out

\-I know it isn't real, although I still feel the affects as if it is.

\-Dark areas specifically facilitate this paranoid feeling

What it isn't:

\-Confusional arousal, this is mainly waking up and being confused. My paranoia happens during a waking state as much as a drowsy state, it happens independently of sleeping although is most prevalent during sleep.

\-Exploding Head Syndrome, it is never auditory and I never see anything. It is just a generalized feeling of being watched or of a presence and I can't shake the feeling.

\-Night Terrors, this happens during NREM stages 3-4 and is more so attributed to a feeling of terror while sleeping, as well as confusion. I am conscious during what I experience and typically it doesn't cross into ""terror"" unless I purposefully ignore the paranoia.

\-Sleep paralysis, I am awake and able to move my body. I also do not see or hear anything.

\-Hypnagogia, seeing as though there is some comorbidity with this and what I experience, I know it is not what I experience primarily. I am not in a drowsy state when my paranoia starts so I know the difference.

\-PTSD (hypervigilance), I was born like this. I can't remember a time I didn't deal with this.

Combined with cpap, my events are under 5 an hour, usually.

One thing to note, when I purposely, consciously flex the back of my throat open, I can feel the lack of obstruction, so it definitely feels like it’s a combination of my giant tongue and the relaxation of the back of my throat area.

Are my settings too low? Even when I’m awake, my airway will collapse briefly and it’s jarring, because the cpap tube suddenly jerks because the pressure becomes obstructed. 

Should I not use the variable pressure? Should I increase the highest pressure? Ive come a long way from when I was diagnosed with severe apnea, but I’m still waking up constantly at night.

1qa6hi0,One week since switching from a Dental device to a CPAP..,"…and I am SO HAPPY!!! 😁 

In June I was diagnosed with sleep apnea (AHI ranged from 14-20). After all I’d read and saw about the horrors of cpap machines, plus the steering from my clinician, I decided to go with the dental device. 

Got fitted, waited the 2-3 weeks to receive it, and then worked my way up the 1, then 2, then 3, then 4mm of moving my jaw forward. By early Fall, after weeks of trial and error, my AHI was down to 5-11 p/hour but I felt better. 

Two months later though, and I realized I still felt tired all the time, still leaned in 3-4 caffeine drinks a day, and still felt like I needed to guard my energy as a precious resource. 

It was also starting to get uncomfortable shifting my jaw back and forth, noticing my jaw not 100% going back into place even though I wore the piece to put my jaw back, religiously - even for 30-40 mins, even though I only was required to for 10 mins. 

Two weeks ago, enough was enough and I talked to my clinician about a CPAP. I’ve got the Resmed Airsense 11 with a nasal pillow mask. It’s only been 7 nights and wow, what a world of difference! 

Im sleeping like a rock, seeing my deep sleep increase on my sleep tracker, and no longer feel constantly in a fog. 

I still have quite a bit of sleep debt to work through but I’m kicking myself that I didn’t try the CPAP sooner! 

I felt noticeably different after night one, which wasn’t the case with the MAD (Mandibular Advancement device). 

I could find so little out there from people like me, who switched from the dental device to a CPAP. So if you havent been happy with your MAD, and you’ve been looking for a sign? Consider this to be it!",1768155223.0,48,8,SleepApnea,sleep

I have sleep apnea as you may expect. I was diagnosed a couple years ago and when I was first diagnosed my insurance gave me a CPAP machine. I had multiple problems with it, but my main problem was a proper seal on my face, it would constantly break and then my CPAP machine would be shut off by morning. 

I went back multiple times and tried to get a new mask but the seal still just wouldn’t work. Eventually I stopped trying to get a new mask and stopped using the CPAP all together. My insurance called me about it and I unfortunately had to turn it back in due to non-compliance, that was about 2 years ago. I haven’t been to my sleep doctor since then, and I am not exactly sure what to do next. I know I need something to help this, as I do snore very loud in my sleep and on the rare occasion that the CPAP would work i would sleep almost silently. Not to mention the other countless health issues that can come with not using one. 

I’m anxious about going back to my sleep doctor, I was told my by primary care provider that if i let it go too long I have to start all over again. I’m not sure what step to take now. I honestly dread having to be put back on that machine, but it seems like my only option. I just don’t want to go back on the merry go round again. Thanks for reading!

It's not the position of my jaw that bothers me, it's just the size of the pieces and it seems really hard to keep it in the right position in my mouth.

Basically, I have 0 symptoms of sleep apnea except for waking up really tired. I’m wondering if there are people in which their sleep apnea manifested itself very subtly? If that’s not the case, I can stop worrying about me possibly having sleep apnea😅. I guess my question is: can I rule sleep apnea out or could it be a very subtle sleep apnea?

1q9tnaj,CPAP quitter now having cognitive issues.. related??,"I found out in 2024 I have severe obstructive sleep apnea. I was absolutely shocked. I was in such Denial I downloaded a free app. On my phone that recorded my sleep when I snored and man it’s really bad.  I’m a almost 40 yr old female, I’m not obese, I don’t have a thick neck, I don’t have anything my doctor told me that normally is some sort of cause for it outwardly. She was shocked  when she saw me because of my test results and how I didn’t fit the main criteria she sees usually. 

That being said, I got the CPAP machine, tried all different masks, had to settle with the full face ( nose and mouth because I’m a mouth breather and my nose stuffs up when I lay down) I couldn’t stand it. I’m a side sleeper and I move around a lot and it drove me bonkers. Tubing was always in the way, mask would leak not matter what size I used, my face hurt and felt gross and I started to get a little rash even though I was super meticulous about keeping it clean and fresh wipes in between. 

I tried it for two weeks and only got up to 3 hours of sleep while using it .

It was so claustrophobic as well for me and I just hated it, I woke every few minutes with it on and every time I rolled over I was wide awake again always having to worry about the damn tubing. As soon as the pressure would go higher it would wake me up. 

So I Quit. But now for the past year I’m having weird cognitive things going on. Like forgetting words, while emailing, texting and talking. Sometimes it feels difficult to talk and get words out. I get weird vertigo that comes a goes, or lasts a long time then goes away for a bit. 

I started sleeping in every day to make up for any loss of sleep if I was able to actually counteract it. I haven’t been super tired during the day since doing this so I thought it might have been doing better, but now this fun brain fog stuff has slithered in starting this past year or so. I’m likely going to see a neurologist just to be safe, but I have a sneaking suspicion it’s the stupid apnea and it makes me want to cry. 

I hate the CPAP so much but I refuse to get the implant surgery. I don’t want it but I also had my airway close down on me after a surgery a few years ago and had to be blue bagged with oxygen to come back. Took them two minutes to bring me back. Ever since I’m too scared to get surgery. 

Anyway, anyone else had this weird brain fog and it was just sleep apnea and it went all away when you treated it? I wish there was more out there for us that suffer with this. It should be important. Seems like so many people I come across have this and I wish we had so many more options. Wish the most that it could be cured.  I know for some losing weight can make it go away. But I don’t have that so whatever is causing mine must be internal in my airway somewhere I assume?  I don’t sleep on my back so it’s not that. 

My brain is fogging right now and it’s 3am I just feel so annoyed with myself and that I couldn’t take the mask wearing, I’m made I even have this in the first place.

My 4 year old daughter was diagnosed with severe central sleep apnea and mild obstructive sleep apnea. She had just under 30 apneas per hour during her sleep study. The MRI showed nothing in her brain, and she is now on oxygen at night. 

I just want to know at the severity level we are at, has anyone had similar and grown out of it? Even with oxygen our sweet and vibrant little girl is waking every 1.5 - 2 hours and it’s unsustainable for all. 

One specialist said they have never seen this bad without a genetic disorder being part of it, and another said she may grow out of it with oxygen and a trip to see the ENT. 

She starts kindy soon and I’m so worried for her. She is tired by mid afternoon and as a result emotional, clingy and anxious.

So, he ordered a split-night study to make sure I have sleep apnea (and then titrate me on CPAP if do).

Did it last night. Had a lot of trouble sleeping, but it wasn’t too far off from what I experience with bad sleep nights anyway. I woke up about 1 am to use the restroom and asked the sleep tech if we needed to do the CPAP yet. She said no—everything was going okay so far. My heart dropped, but figured maybe it could still happen later. I took a while to fall back asleep, then next thing I knew, it was morning. Still no CPAP titrating.

I’m a bit crushed. I was hoping for an easy answer (besides insomnia) to help explain why I snore so loudly, why I wake up several times during the night to use the restroom when I’m not on 150 mg of trazodone, why I never have energy, and why I have so many mental health issues. I thought it was going to be a slam dunk, too, since my dad, grandpa, grandma, and (potentially) mom have it too. But nope.

Might be speaking prematurely (maybe there’s something else besides sleep apnea that this test could picked up on), but as of now, I’m cringing at how I probably spent $850 on this for nothing. Guess I have to wait and see what the pulmonologist says whenever I can get an appointment with him.

I wont bore you with all the details, but I’m currently using CPAP with only a bit of success.

At this point I’m very used to being tired, but the effect on my cognition is what genuinely scares me and stresses me out.

1q8b5nt,Advice needed: skipping CPAP and going to MAD device,"Hi folks,
 
I’ve read through a lot of helpful info in this sub – thank you to all those who post and reply!
 
Just diagnosed with Moderate OSA after two night home study. My details:  49 yr old male, Washington DC area, BMI 26.2, AHI = 18.6, OAI = 3.1; Lowest SpO2% = 84
 
After researching the CPAP experiences of so many, I’m thinking of skipping the CPAP and going directly to the Mandibular Advancement Device. Research I did suggests I ought to be able to have this covered by my health insurance, albeit with me paying a deductible. Anyone else done this and have any experiences to share? 

Also, I asked Google Gemini AI for some help researching the various brands/models of MAD devices and it gave me these data points below. I’m thinking of choosing a dentist that specifically works with the ProSomnus EVO because it’s supposedly thinner and less bulky and that sounds good to me. Anyone have experiences with that specific model of MAD?
 
Grateful for any advice / thoughts. Have a good one!!
 
Here’s what Google Gemini told me:
 
Recommended Makes and Models
Not all ""mouth guards"" are the same. Experts generally recommend custom-fabricated, titratable (adjustable) devices rather than over-the-counter ""boil-and-bite"" versions. The following models are frequently cited by dental sleep medicine experts for their comfort and durability:

ProSomnus® EVO™: Often considered the ""new standard"" because it is 3D-milled from a single piece of medical-grade plastic. It is significantly thinner and less bulky than older models, making it much easier to close your lips over it.

Panthera Classic: Made of medical-grade nylon, this device is extremely strong but very thin. It uses interchangeable rods to adjust the jaw position, which is gentler on the jaw (TMJ) because it allows for more natural side-to-side movement during sleep.

SomnoMed (SomnoDent® Avant™): This model features a soft ""B-flex"" liner that cradles the teeth, making it a good choice if you have sensitive teeth or existing dental work.

Thornton Adjustable Positioner (TAP®): A classic and highly effective model. It features a single adjustment screw in the front, allowing for very precise (millimeter by millimeter) advancements, though the front screw can feel bulky to some.

1q8906h,Very infrequent OSA/ positional apnea?,"When I spoke to a sleep doc about my symptoms, I feel that I got a strange look from him. Because of the price and infrequency of the episodes, I declined a sleep study. I'm wondering if anyone else experiences sleep apnea like this:

I'm dreaming, then suddenly dream me can no longer inhale or exhale. Dream me just struggles with it for what feels like a long time, then eventually, when it feels like I'm going to suffocate to death, I wake up. When I wake up, I recognize that each time, I've woken up on my back. However, this has only happened 3 times in about 2 years.

Does anyone else have OSA that presents like this? It's so incredibly unpleasant and alarming and I wake up so breathless and often feel like I can't breathe properly for awhile after waking. But it's just so, so infrequent that it feels silly to seekout treatment-- until it happens again and I'm scared out of my wits. Like, I've never snored in my sleep and my family doesn't seem to have much history with sleep apnea (other than my father, who is a chain smoker and in his mid-60s with more weight on than me). I almost always sleep halfway on my stomach or on my side, so I feel like this shouldn't be an issue and that it could be avoided if I just could prevent myself from rolling over but I'm a Trans person and would hopefully get top surgery one day, and to my knowledge that would require an extended period of back sleeping to make sure the healing went well.

Thanks for all the responses, sounds like it’s impossible for the time being, and BiPAP will never work due to hardware limitations.

1q85x8z,Going for MMA (maxillomandibular advancement) surgery,"My sleep apnea is severe (AHI = 40). It was NOT alleviated by weight loss. AHI remained pretty much the same after 100 pound + weight loss. 

  
Could not tolerate BiPAP (CPAP was not recommended). Reason: the pressures were extreme. It felt like hurricane force winds being blown into my mouth. Completely intolerable even when awake. 

  
I kind of just let the symptoms go for a while, but I have been suffering and sleep apnea has been wreaking havoc on my life. 

  
Got evaluated for Inspire - got the DISE (Drug Induced Sleep Endoscopy). The results of that showed no complete concentric collapse, and improvement in the airway with a jaw thrust. Key piece of information.

  
I knew I would not be able to tolerate intraoral devices. 

  
So the options were pretty much: Inspire or MMA. Anyone else face this choice?

  
My doctor recommended that I think carefully about the long-term. Inspire is an easier surgery with easier recovery, but it's a life-long commitment with a device, a remote, and, at my age, the prospect of several battery changes. It's an effective treatment, but not 100% effective. 

  
MMA is a much more complicated and invasive surgery, and it changes your facial appearance. But the benefits appear to be immense. It appears that I have the perfect anatomy for MMA (slightly retruded lower jaw with narrow airway, tongue-based collapse on the DISE). My obstruction is not really due to weight or due to soft tissue in the throat. It's just that my lower jaw is set back and the tongue has nowhere to go. 

  
I got my CT scans on November 25th. I still haven't heard back from the surgeon (who said on December 9th that he's waiting for the Virtual Surgical Planning meeting). I am DYING to hear the results of this planning meeting. I really really want to know what the next steps are, and if this surgery could have the life-changing effects that it seems to have. 

  
Has anyone else faced this decision tree? 

Inspire: easier treatment, long-term device and implant use, possibly less effective for certain anatomies

MMA: invasive, but possibly curative, particularly for some anatomies?

  
I need hope. I have not had good sleep for 10+ years. My life is completely on pause due to poor sleep. It's a nightmare and it's torturous.

  
The thought that something could relieve this is giving me tremendous hope. If anyone else shared this path, let me know.

My AHI was only 8 when I did my sleep study but my doctor thought it would be best to get the machine.

1q81324,Finally feeling the benefit of my CPAP after a year of tweaking and now I look forward to sleeping for the first time in nearly 2 decades,"Because I actually fall asleep when I put it on, rather than find sleep something only other people can “do” when they decide they want to. For nearly my whole adult life and particularly the last 15 years it’s been something I have no part to play in deciding and was something I avoided for as long as possible to put off the suffering of waiting for sleep to come. I felt like an alien who constantly found it fascinating that people can “decide” to go to sleep or have an early night just because they want to. That alone is feeling life changing. 

And I also wake up feeling better. I’m not at the “Life feels magical” effect but it’s still a huge improvement for me. I had a crazy but fun weekend last week with just 4-5 hours sleep in a row and really busy and tiring days and I felt fine to get on with it all. I did crash after the weekend and recuperate but normally I would’ve struggled to fall asleep each night (it’s usually even worse when I’m more tired and busy, combined with sharing hotel rooms/beds I end up not being able to sleep at all) and then struggled to wake up each morning, felt horrendous all day and would’ve totally ruined the experience of the weekend. I fell asleep with ease and literally woke up raring to go even on the 2nd day!

Even before that weekend that proved it to me I knew I’d finally achieved a good place with it because I *wanted* to put it on each night, didn’t want to go without, even making the effort to pack it up for 1 night stays and still setting it up when I’m exhausted and it’s 5am. When previously I felt no inclination to wear it, kept slacking on using it for weeks/months, would not bother with the effort of taking it for even 1 week stays as I felt no benefit, it was just a pain and usually kept me up even more. 

I didn’t think I’d get here and was really discouraged when it was doing nothing for me at  the start and for a long time after, but I’m so glad I pushed for the changes I thought I needed (in the UK where I can’t change anything on my NHS machine myself) and have a really good nurse who listens to me and worked with me to make every change I feel I needed to get this result.

I do have a very large tongue and thick neck (19.5""). My snoring is a household disruption and as I read more about symptoms of sleep apnea I am starting to think that I've got many other issues related.

Here's what the doctor suggested: 

Weight loss - At 38 I am 300lb and 6'3"". This is clearly the best option for my overall health. I asked how much to lose and after a discussion they said about 50 pounds at least. I suspect I could benefit from losing more. It would likely help my breathing when asleep , but I've snored since before I was heavy. I am working on this, I'm not sure I need advice here.

CPAP - This sounds like it's the gold standard. They said they could write a script and connect me with a sales person. I was worried about noise, but it sound like anything is better than snoring.

Oral Device - because of my mild apnea and tongue size, it seems like I'm a good candidate for an oral device. Jaw position and tongue position appear to be the biggest culprits for me. They have a local dentist they can recommend. 

I feel like I'd prefer to try the oral device first, then the CPAP if that doesn't work. Weight loss is clearly number 1, but I'm not dropping 50 pounds in 4 weeks (although the oral device seems like it may take forever too?).

Now my searches are filled with daybreak and sleeprx and every other device out there, they all seem scammy to me, idk why. I also hear that dentists overcharge. I'm kinda nervous that the oral device market is full of con artists as it's not as well established as the CPAP market.

I initially asked Copilot to tell me about each item on the OSCAR report and whether my 6-month results for that category were good or bad and I was blown away by the explanation and the results.  I then fed everything back in and asked Copilot to analyze everything and provide me with a report of my overall therapy and was blown away a second time as it said that based on my 6 month results was that:

My therapy is effective, I have stable Airway Control, I have low obstructive events, my flow limitations are low, my RERA's are low, my leak performance is acceptable, my periodic breathing is normal, my central apnea's are moderate but stable and that my pressure setting match my needs.

Granted that this was not a substitute for a doctor's interpretation of my results but I did find the explanation and the interpretation of results interesting and think that other's that may be worried about their results or just curious might find this something they want to try.",1767909226.0,1,3,SleepApnea,sleep

Not yay, I have to do a CPAP trial which is apparently not covered by insurance, which means I’m going to have to find a way to pay for it out of pocket and I’m getting estimates of $300-$600. So that’s nice 🙃  

  

The doctor told me during the sleep study I stopped breathing 96 times in one hour, which is absolutely crazy to me. Hopefully I can figure it all out soon though.

   

He also told me that it may turn out to be that a CPAP won’t work, so I may need a BIPAP at some point instead.

1q7hvw0,Tips for fixing “rain out”?,"My boyfriend is on a ResMed CPAP machine. He was having problems keeping the mask on in the middle of the night with both just the nose mask and one of the full face masks that the hose connects to the top of his head, so he went to get fitted for a different one. This one is also full face but the hose connects at the mask covering his mouth/nose. It seems like ever since then he’s had a lot of condensation happening and the mask is also doing this clicking thing when he breathes out. It sounds almost like a flap? He tried his other mask and kind of had the same issue. We have no idea what’s causing the clicking/flapping but he said it makes him feel like he can’t breathe. 


We have changed the pressure settings, turned ramp up off, changed the temp for the hose (although I’m not entirely sure how to even know if it is a heated hose?). I’m not sure if there’s other settings for the humidity or not. The machine sits probably 12 inches below his head, maybe a little more due to the bed sitting up higher than the end table. We haven’t tried a hose cover so we still need to do that. The only thing we really can’t do is bring the temp up in the room itself - I have thyroid issues and cannot sleep at all if it’s too warm. I’ve even invested in expensive bedding to have the most breathable material I can have to help with that. 



His sleep doctor has been useless in general so he’s looking for a new one but it seems like a lot of this is more trial and error on your own than it is the doctor doing something about it. Any suggestions or advice is appreciated.

1q74nn8,Got my sleep apnea surgery yesterday (tonsillectomy and BRP),"Hi guys.

So I wanted to share my story and experience of my journey up to getting surgery for my sleep apnea. (31 Female)

4 years ago I started waking up gasping for air. I asked for a referral to the doctor and guess what I tested positive for sleep apnea. The doctor j got back then was a female and she adviced me to lose weight (even though im not overweight just a bit thick baddie 😆). So then I was like fuck it, dont have a good feeling about the doctor, not proceeding.

1,5 years ago i still had problems with sleep and not waking up refreshed. I also noticed a lot of vague symptoms which were not found on blood tests. So I asked my GP to get a new referral. I got another doctor and he’s been great.

Last summer I got a sleep study in the hospital and my doctor recommended removing my tonsils (#tonsillectomy) and have #BRPsurgery.

Fast forward.. yesterday was my operation. Gosh. What should I say.

It was my first surgery ever so I was anxious (besides that I have GAD), so double the fun. I started crying in the operation room of anxiety and some communication issues with the staff. The staff was super empathetic though.

After surgery I came out a bit sad and it hurt! So they increased the pain meds. I also was super nauseous.

In the recovery room I was so fatigued, nauseous and tired. I started throwing up blood (old blood) from the surgery which was stuck in my stomach. It was so painful and gross (felt a bit ashamed in front of other patients). It took 2,5 hours for the nausea to go away.

After that I threw up all the liquids I drank in the mean time 😅

Eventually in the evening I could go home. At home I started feeling better, used my pain medication as prescribed. So now it is the morning after. As for now I feel okay, not too much pain.

Let’s see how my recovery will unfold. I will post some updates later.

I have some tips for surgery which I found super helpful

\- bring an extra bag of clothing (jogging pants, underwear, T-shirt). Came in handy after I threw up all over myself.

\- bring your own big bottle of water

\- bring some deodorant for after surgery

\- make sure someone can be with you after surgery. This is so needed!!!! My husband had to work but I insisted him to come. I was glad I insisted because I felt so sick and was happy that he was there.

Also the hospital insists someone coming for you to get home and monitor for 24 hours for the risk of bleeding.

\- drink a lot of liquids. Also during the night. I set up alarms to wake up to drink water (every two hours). It really helped, dont experience too much pain. Otherwise it gets dry.

\- DONT talk after surgery. It’s going to help manage the pain and recovery. For communication just use WhatsApp or use a blocnote.

A small observation post op;

Even though it’s not been long since surgery and my wounds need to heal. So maybe it’s too early to say this but I notice my sleep being more deep. I don’t have this feeling of something stuck in my throat while sleeping. So yay 🥳

1q74joj,CPAP Hypoallergenic Comfortable Design?,"Hi! My dad has sleep apnea, and has been struggling finding the correct CPAP. He first tried the mouth and nose one, felt like it was too much pressure and uncomfortable. Then he tried the one with gel, was better, but the straps were still uncomfortable and irritable because of his eczema. Then he got the one of just the nose, but he started breathing from his mouth. So, he got a mouth tape, which he tends to use but is also bothersome. With his current mask, he’s doing okay but can’t seem to use the mask for over 3-4 hours because of how uncomfortable it is, and he feels like he can’t change position.

1q6yy9q,First two nights with cpap machine have been terrible,"First of all I'm sure this sub gets a million posts like this a day, and this post is long, so I'm sorry about both of those things. 

So I got diagnosed with moderate sleep apnea a couple of months ago and I'm doing a cpap machine trial with a rental for two weeks. Don't worry I'm not going to give up on it or anything yet since every single person I have talked to irl tells me their cpap machine helped them so much and changed their life. But these are my symptoms the first two nights trying it out:

-despite a perfect fit, the nasal pillows mask really hurts my nose when I slept on my side. My nose gets pushed up and it is very painful. I don't even really get how it happened. The mask is not too tight or anything. I genuinely strongly dislike the nose pillows, it's just not right for me. I have talked to the sleep specialist and next week I will be trying a nasal mask. Most people I know irl who recommend cpap to me are using the full face mask. I don't want to go that far because someone I talked to said the face mask messed up the position of their teeth. I am NOT dealing with any shit like that since I have a history of overbite and dental problems. So I will be trying out nasal mask. I have a good feeling about it. A number of people I have talked to I talked to also didn't go with the nasal pillows and use the full face mask now even though they seem comfortable at first. I haven't had any problems breathing through my nose, I am not mouth breathing, so I'm happy to try the nasal mask. I don't care if the nasal mask leaves marks on my face or causes pain on my face or around the nose. It's the pushing upwards on my nose feeling that I do not like that happened with the nasal pillows. I'm scared it will change my nose into a pig nose lol. Again I promise you the mask isn't too tight and I'm wearing it correctly according to how the specialist showed me. It's if I go on my side a weird way. It's strange. Anyway.

-Worst sleep I've had in four years, so obviously I am extremely tired

-vibrating, dizzy and trouble walking

-Throat, lungs and chest hurt

-hives and itching on my neck and legs

-severe anxiety (I have anxiety anyway but it is significantly worse)

-heart racing

-excessive sweating 

-overheated

-increased thirst

-very bad headache. I have chronic headache as it is and having the headache hurt worse than normal these past two days is really hell. My headache problem is the main reason I'm trying to address my sleep apnea since I am pretty sure part of the reason I have headaches is due to sleep apnea. I also have many other health issues that I believe are connected to sleep apnea even if it just a mild connection. 

I know that the machine can get bacteria or fungus etc and maybe I'm breathing that in but I really don't think that's the case. I trust the company that I got the rental from. It would be very unlikely and shocking it if was something like that.

It's like my whole body is just rejecting the cpap. I have MCAS and fibromyalgia so I think it is my body literally having a reaction to this and being sensitive to it. I am not giving up yet like I said but the last two nights/days have been almost torture. 

I am fat so obviously weight loss is recommended to me to help with sleep apnea.  But a couple years ago I had lost weight. And then over 4 years I gained most of it back. And during that time when I was not overweight I am certain I still had sleep apnea. So I really have to try my best to make the cpap work because I'm shit out of luck otherwise. And I need better sleeps and less chronic pain to help me lose weight anyway if I want to make a better effort at that. 

If there is any encouraging things anyone can say to me please let me know. If anyone here had their first nights be this extremely bad,  but they have adjusted to it and benefit from cpap machine now, please let me know. I legit almost had a mental breakdown today.

On the plus side -- I talked to a person from the sleep company and she said I had much less stopping breathing events and that on paper all the data/results are good. I also have the MyAir app and saw these results as well.

And the second night was definitely better than the first.

What's scaring me the most is my throat, lungs and chest hurting. Is that normal at all? 

Thanks for reading. Tonight I'm not using it just so I can recover from the last two nights. Then tomorrow I'll be using it again.

After 7 hours I woke up and the mask had slipped so that the air was blowing on the side of my face. I turned it off and looked at the reading, it indicated that I had 160 minutes of use. It was on for 7 hours so that would/should have been 420 minutes not 160.

The AHI was at 0.0....very strange since I was tossing and turning. I definitely did not have a refreshed feeling like I did my first night of using it. I am pretty sure I was in actuality having lots of AHI. I went to the bathroom and started the machine again. I was having trouble falling back asleep. I eventually put a mask/covering over my eyes (actually made the CPAP mask fit a little better/tighter). What I noticed was that it was on its 30 minute ramp mode so I was not getting enough air and kept having to open my mouth to breath. I laid there for quite a bit and eventually fell back asleep...for quite some time.

When I woke up I was more refreshed (I did total more than 9 hours of sleep) my readings on this run were 260 minutes with an hourly AHI rate of 8 (I was plus 30 prior to my CPAP). My leak rate was 12.1 (it was 9.1).

I shortened my ramp time from 30 minutes to 20 since I am definitely not getting enough air during the ramp up. My minimum air flow is 4 and maximum is 12. I will also add that the Luna G3 is not easy to adjust. Getting from panel to panel is extremely counter-intuitive.

1q6tbnx,iNAP device shipped.  3-month trial vs my CPAP,"I had an AHI about 30.  On CPAP (Resmed Airsense 10, nasal mask), I have usually 0-1, usually 0.2-0.8, so I seem to respond very well to it.  I very much though dislike using it.  I dislike traveling with it.  I dislike almost everything about it, except that the device and all my supplies are free through insurance.  My provider did test me twice on a temporary mandibular advancement device, that I heat molded, then was able to add more load (mm) on.  It was very uncomfortable, and my AHI didn't drop enough to justify it, so I abandoned it. I also tested on my own dime one of those stupid silicone tongue retention device's where my tongue sticks out my mouth.  Not realistic at all and I tossed it in the trash.

I thought what is $1500 in the grand scheme of things IF I respond well to iNAP and I enjoy using it a lot more.  I opted for their minimum 3 month trial at I think $49 or something a month.  I had to pay $39 for a 5 minute video conf meeting to get the Rx.  My medical provider has said they will authorize a sleep study when I am using iNAP.  So worst case I am out about $200 and I go back to CPAP.  If my provider would not have authorized a study or iNAP would have only offered the option of full price for the device with no returns, then I wouldn't have attempted this.

I think one part that will be okay for me is that I cannot tell any difference the next day if I was using my CPAP or not at all. I can go to bed at 11p, and get up at 430a, slept like a rock and instantly ready to take on the world.  The only reason I even found out I have OSA is because my wife noticed it when I sleep.  The sleep clinic at my provider was surprised by this, but admits, for my overall heart and brain health, using the CPAP is best.

I have a pulse oximeter that I sometimes use, pulling the data in to OSCAR along with my Airsense and review it.  I plan to use the device while using iNAP, but will only have heart rate and blood oxygen saturation to review.  Still may be interesting. to compare say Thursday on CPAP+pulse oximeter, then Friday on iNAP+pulse oximeter from that perspective.

It is arriving tomorrow, but I don't think I can try it till Friday due to scheduling and no time tomorrow to mess with it.   We'll see...

I've looked up nasal strips and dilators, as well as some mouth guards.  I bought some Breathe Right strips that are being delivered today and am excited to use them (though I imagine it won't help the snoring because it's all caused by my tongue/throat, not my nose).

Are there any preferred mouth guards that people use that have helped them?  Should I go for one that molds to my jaw?  Also how are the magnetic nasal strips that use the sticky pads to open the nose up?  I'm keen to try those as well but don't like the idea of constantly buying the sticky magnet pads.

1q6q4xw,Sleep getting worse…?,"Hi everyone. I was diagnosed with severe OSA in August 2023 and have been using a CPAP since, with consistent/easy use for about a year now. 

This past Monday, I started my next block of trades school. I got around probably 4-5 hours of sleep Sunday night, but was mostly fine the next day despite the initial wakeup being a bit hard. I made sure I went to bed early Monday night and I slept 7-8 hours, but was way more tired the next day to the point I was struggling to stay awake at times. Same thing with today, despite getting more and even better quality sleep.

I didn't have troubles with my machine any of these nights, but still double checked everything, to which I found no signs of anything amiss. I'm really confused because this hasn't been an issue at all since I started using my machine consistently. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this or knows what it might be and how to fix it.

I used to function better off of 5~ hours of sleep in high school pre-sleep apnea, so maybe that's that returning. It could also be the fact I'm adjusting to getting up early again (I had about two weeks off work for Christmas) but I really don't think it should be kicking my ass this hard.

1q6ofhk,At home sleep study failure,"Hello! I am writing to get some input on my boyfriends struggles. Around covid time, he started to develop a chronic illness with symptoms including exercise intolerance, low energy, kind of allergy like symptoms, and an inability to recover like he use to, feeling like his sleep quality was poor, and also waking up at night and not being able to go back to sleep, and wheezing amongs others. 

We of course thought that this may be covid related, but i also noticed he snored and sometimes seemed to be breathing weirdly while he was asleep, and many of his symptoms also align with having sleep apnea so i suggested he try a sleep study.

He got the sleep study monitoring devices from his doctor for an at home study. The problem is  the devices were so clunky and uncomfortable for him, he didnt sleep the entire night. He also was only scheduled to have the devices for one night so he had to give it back and results were too poor for any diagnoses. The whole process was so annoying from getting the device to using it that he has never tried again. 

Fast forward 3 years, and he is still battling all the same stuff, it has made him incredibly depressed and sometimes a shell of his former self.

1q6nhhs,Is a CPAP worth it for very mild apnea?,"Hello! I was recently diagnosed with OSA. However, the minimum for a mild OSA diagnosis is 5 AHI, and I clocked in at a measly 5.5. I'm looking into getting a CPAP machine, and wondering if there's a point, considering my AHI was so low.

I do have excessive daytime sleepiness, which is why I was evaluated. It ranges from ""kinda sleepy"" to falling asleep at my desk, seemingly at random. I also have some difficulty focusing/thinking with challenging tasks. I'm not sure if the latter is sleepiness or just how my brain works.

I’ve struggled with sleep-onset insomnia for a long time, and one thing that consistently helps me is **audiobooks** — but only very specific kinds. Not podcasts, not hype-filled narrations, and not stories that are too engaging.

I recently put together a breakdown of **Amazon best-selling audiobooks that people with insomnia actually use to fall asleep**, focusing on things like:

* narrator voice and pacing
* predictable, low-stimulation content
* books that don’t trigger “I need to know what happens next”
* why some popular sleep audiobooks *don’t* work for insomniacs

I’m genuinely curious what works for others here:

* Do audiobooks help you fall asleep or keep you awake?
* Fiction vs non-fiction?
* Calm voices vs monotone narration?

1q6hdgi,Sleep study results,"I put my results in AI because it will be another month before the doctor goes over them. I slept horrible and it says I didn't go into deep sleep. Which I usually do on my watch and oura ring but not this night.  My AHI is 4 but 12 in REM that I was only in for 20 mins. 

Here are my results from AI:
The main number doctors use to diagnose sleep apnea is the AHI (Apnea-Hypopnea Index). This measures how many times per hour your breathing stops or becomes very shallow.
​Normal: AHI less than 5
​Mild Apnea: AHI 5 – 15
​Moderate Apnea: AHI 15 – 30
​Severe Apnea: AHI greater than 30
​Your Result:
​Your Overall AHI is 4.0 (Found on Page 1 under ""Respiratory Data"").
​Because this number is below 5, it technically falls within the ""Normal"" range for adults.
​However, there is a nuance:
​REM Sleep: During REM sleep (dreaming sleep), your AHI went up to 12.0. While your overall average is normal, your breathing is more disturbed when you are dreaming.
​2. Significant Findings (Other than Apnea)
​While the apnea number is low, there are other very significant findings in this report that could explain why you might feel tired or unrefreshed.
​A. Periodic Limb Movements (PLMs)
​This measures how often your legs (or arms) twitch or move involuntarily during sleep.
​Your PLM Index is 46.1 (Found on Page 2).
​Normal is typically under 15. A score of 46 is considered quite high.
​This suggests you might have Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD). These movements are happening frequently enough that they might be disturbing your sleep quality, even if you don't wake up fully.
​B. Poor Sleep Quality & Architecture
​Sleep Efficiency: Your sleep efficiency was 50% (Page 1). Normal is usually 85% or higher. This means you spent half the night lying in bed awake.
​Deep Sleep (Stage N3): You had 0% deep sleep (Page 1). Deep sleep is physically restorative. Missing this stage completely is a major reason for feeling physically exhausted.
​Sleep Latency: It took you 74 minutes to fall asleep.
​Summary
​While the report does not show a classic case of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (since the AHI is 4.0), it does show significant disruption to your sleep, likely caused by:
​Limb Movements (PLMs): Your legs are moving roughly 46 times per hour.
​Fragmented Sleep: You are waking up frequently and getting zero deep sleep.

So what is the reason for the opposite effect? Is it the case that my body is storing water as a result of the pressure changes, or is it my appetite hormones (ghrelin or leptin) that are rebalancing differently now? It has also struck me that I might be simply eating more because I am finally feeling wide awake during the day. It is really annoying because many people report weight loss soon after their sleep improves.

1q5zqrk,First night with CPAP and slept like a rock....expensive but I am lucky!,"I have severe sleep apnea, more than 30 AHI an hour. After experiencing what I real night of sleep is like, it has, in many ways, probably ruined my life to a certain extent. But the following story is very positive.  
  
I spent an hour plus with my sleep doc yesterday. I decided to go with his machine/insurance and spent good chunk of change, $1150 ($1k deductible for the machine and $150 for the office visit). I told him ""I can get the machine for 500 bucks"". He claimed that that was even less than what he paid and it must be used (not true). But what sold me was that he said ""you can take home a machine today and with me coaching you will have a much better chance that the 50% compliance rate."" I was desperate, so I went for the sales rap.  
  
 His staff claimed the $150 for the office visit was for ""a procedure"" (he did stick a tube way down my nose) even though my dermatologist, urologist, all do some procedures when I see them and only charge me my $40 deductible. 

I will do a separate post at some point on insurance vs buying new out of pocket but I will say my doc set it up and it worked great. I just hooked everything up, added water to the humidifier, plugged it in and put the mask on. It started working automatically. I could not sleep at first so I cheated: I took a valium. 35 minutes later I went to bed and zonk, was asleep. I woke up once during the night to pee and the mask was off a bit, adjusted it and fell right back asleep. 

I slept 8 full hours. When I woke up I felt like I did 40 years ago (before sleep apnea) when I overslept. The point is it was the deepest sleep I have had in years....probably decades. I have a follow up with my doc in a week but a couple of quick questions for the board: When I hit report it said AHI was 1.8. Is that per hour or total over 8 hours? Either way, pretty incredible considering I was having more that 30 per hour.  
  
 The report also said my average leak rate was 9.1L/min, which I understand was pretty good, yes?

So in short, did I hit the CPAP motherload/lottery on my first night? I have been absolutely exhausted and miserable for years....it killed my career and in many ways ruined my life (and I have heart problems).

I’m looking for some insight or shared experiences.
About a month ago, my father had a strange episode around 3 a.m. He was drooling, making unusual noises, and would not fully wake up. When we called his name or shook him, he would briefly open his eyes, look around, then close them again and seem to drift back into deep sleep. He was unresponsive otherwise.
My father has a history of epilepsy, so we assumed it was a seizure and gave him his SOS medication. We contacted his doctor, who advised that if he appeared stable afterward, we could wait until morning to bring him in. The next day, he woke up completely normal and had no memory of the episode. We took him to the doctor, and based on our description, the doctor was unsure whether it was a nocturnal seizure or something like sleep paralysis. He advised a sleep study.
The sleep study showed moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and he was prescribed an auto-CPAP machine. However, due to anxiety and claustrophobia, he has been avoiding using it.
Tonight—almost a month later—he had a very similar episode again: drooling, making sounds, not fully waking up, briefly opening his eyes when called, then going back to sleep. Again, he has no recollection of it afterward.

I've been using a CPAP for nearly 3 years now. I tried APAP, CPAP, BiPAP, ASV, up, down, on, off, fast, slow, backup, enthusiast hacked firmware. Everything. I've bought 8 different masks. I've tried everything for at least 2-4 weeks. My anatomy just doesn't respond to CPAP and my O2 still drops.

I've had nasal surgery to open up my nose. That's made life a little more comfortable but isn't curing anything.

I have an MAD and that's the only thing that remotely works, but it just takes the apnea down one notch. I get a couple fewer desaturations and they're slightly less severe, and I feel slightly better. But it's not great.

I've seen all the 'sleep specialists' in this town now. What do I do now? I guess the next options are surgery? Either cracking and repositioning my jaw with a 3 month recovery and >$10k bill, or the less invasive but less efficacious Inspire Therapy.

But who do I even speak to? Which kind of doctor will order a scan of my airway and then make an assessment and decide what type of surgery I need? The dental surgeon will do the bien surgery and the sleep doctor will do soft tissue surgery, but I don't know which one I'm supposed to speak to do decide which one I need.

Also, in terms of insurance, how does this work? I assume we need to show that CPAP doesn't work, but I've always bought my CPAP privately because it was cheaper than a DME through insurance, but now there is no record of my use. This is a headache.

1. Does it change your jawline physically (can you see a difference looking at yourself in the mirror)  
2. Does it really ""mess up"" your teeth, bite and jawline? In all cases?  
3. If yes, is there a way to simply prevent this?

We removed the EPR and increased my pressure setting from 5-15 to 7-15. Made a big difference.

However tonight I’m not able to sleep with it on. I might need just a basic nasal pillow

Took his tonsils/adenoids out, and now sleeps great! It’s been about 1.5 years since the surgery. 

Current issue: My second child has always struggled with what we thought was GERD/reflux. Frequently gags/vomits food. Also wakes frequently, but not as often as my first did. No snoring but does sleep with his mouth open. He also groans/moans loudly multiple times a night (i assumed it was pain from reflux?) Child is recently 2, and twice this week has gone to bed and within 1.5 hours, has vomited. We have reached out to our pediatrician and waiting to discuss further.

1q4y1mb,Is there a chance?,"Hey everyone,
I’m trying to understand why I’m still chronically tired and would appreciate outside perspective.

For context, I’m in my early 20s. For the past 3–4 years, I’ve averaged around ~500 mg of caffeine per day (coffee + energy drinks). I’ve also taken 5 mg melatonin nightly for several years. For the last ~2 years, I’ve been prescribed Adderall, which I take intermittently (not daily).

Despite this, I:
	•	Sleep 8–9 hours every night
	•	Exercise 4–5x/week
	•	Eat reasonably well
	•	Recently started enforcing a consistent 10pm–7am sleep schedule

Even with all of that, I still feel unrefreshed most mornings, need caffeine/stimulants to function, and never feel truly “awake.” It’s not depression — more like constant low energy and heavy sleep inertia.

I’ve had basic bloodwork done (CBC, CMP, testosterone, TSH/T4), which all came back normal.

My questions:
	•	Can long-term high caffeine + nightly melatonin use actually worsen sleep quality over time?
	•	Is it possible to be getting enough sleep but poor restorative sleep?
	•	Has anyone reversed something like this by tapering caffeine/melatonin or fixing circadian rhythm issues?
	•	Would a sleep study or cortisol testing be worth pursuing?

1q4r3z6,Newly diagnosed with mild sleep apnea (NHS) – looking for advice on next steps & what I can push for,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some advice from people with experience of sleep apnea, particularly within the NHS system.
I was today diagnosed with mild sleep apnea via a very brief (8 minute) telephone consultation with the sleep specialist (an anaesthetist by specialty) following my home sleep study completed in August. I was told my AHI was 13.6, advised to use CPAP, and subsequently prescribed a machine.

I was instructed to:
-Use CPAP for at least 4 hours per night
-The consultant would monitor my data remotely
-I’d have a follow-up appointment in ~12 weeks

Since then, I’ve done a lot more reading and feel I went into that appointment underprepared. I’ve often been told previously that I “wouldn’t have sleep apnea” because I’m underweight, so this diagnosis caught me off guard and I now have quite a few unanswered questions.

I’m keen not to just wait 12 weeks if there are things I could reasonably be doing or pushing for sooner. I’m mainly trying to understand how much I’m limited by the sleep specialist vs what I can progress independently.

Specific questions I’d really appreciate advice on:
-Am I entitled to request the full results of my sleep study (raw data / report), and is this commonly done via the NHS?
-With mild SA, would a sleep specialist typically investigate underlying causes?
For context: I’m a mouth breather, have an overbite, and feel my nasal breathing is less effective (though not fully blocked).
-Would an ENT referral usually be considered, or is that something I’d need to push for?
-If I wanted to explore a Mandibular Repositioning Appliance (MRA):
Does this need to be initiated by the sleep clinic?
Or can I go directly to a dentist/orthodontist (NHS or private) without a referral?

I’m not anti-CPAP, but I’d like to understand all reasonable options, especially given the “mild” diagnosis and anatomical factors that might be contributing.

Any insight from people who’ve navigated the NHS sleep pathway, or who’ve been in a similar position, would be hugely appreciated.

I did a sleep study my doctor referred me to a few years ago. It went terribly as I couldn’t get any sleep at all during it due to all the wires and shit and not being in the comfort of my own bed, so nothing could be found result-wise, meaning I don’t have a diagnosis of sleep apnea.

EDIT: OK, I should clarify myself. It is hard to explain as it is very subjective, but what I mean by that is: I didn't expect that consistently using CPAP would have any effect on my emotional state/mood/behaviour as it did - for instance, I reduced alcohol consumption after CPAP, my decisions are different from the patterns I used to have before treating SA, my spendings are a LOT better.

Not to say that they are positive our negative - my life was quite good before CPAP therapy, it got better taking care of my health properly and sleeping better, of course - but the impact went beyond only health and sleep improvement, it impacted my mood and such.

He has excellent credentials, is a surgeon, and ENT, and did an actual fellowship in sleep medicine. However his reviews are mixed, lower than other physicians. Complaints were about his bedside manner and the fact that he cancels appointments. Sure enough, when I saw him he was brusk and cancelled my follow up appointment an hour prior to it taking place. However I have another appointment with him tomorow.

I just want to get started on some treatment. One concern I have is that his office assistant went through my insurance and said that my CPAP would be $1300 out of pocket. As we know, I can get a new machine of my own for $499. Should I just do what he says if he pushes for the insurance/DME? I also want to get the machine as quickly as possible.

I had a sleep study done back in October 2024 and Im trying to get a better real-world understanding of my results. I’ve attached a screenshot of the report for reference.

From what I can tell, my apnea seems to fall somewhere between mild and moderate, and it looks significantly worse during REM sleep compared to non REM.

Symptoms 

* Nonrestorative sleep
* Daytime fatigue and brain fog
* This feels like something Ive probably had for a while, not something recent

Questions

1. Based on the screenshot, would you personally consider this mild or moderate?
2. If your apnea was REM-dominant, what treatment worked best for you?
3. Did CPAP make a noticeable difference with similar results?
4. At this level, did lifestyle changes alone help, or was therapy necessary?

Ill obviously follow up with a doctor, but Id really value hearing experiences from people who’ve had similar studies.

1q3vixd,CPAP instantly causes ear pressure and hearing issues. How do people with ETD make this work?,"Hi everyone. I’m feeling pretty desperate and hoping to hear from others who’ve dealt with 
similar issues. 
I was diagnosed with REM related sleep apnea with an AHI of 31 during REM and deeper 
sleep. It’s been seriously affecting my life and functioning, and I’m basically a zombie at this 
point. 
I started CPAP this week using a ResMed AirSense 11 with nasal pillows. Comfort wise it was 
great. Breathing felt easy and natural. Unfortunately, even at the lowest pressure setting of 4, 
my Eustachian tubes immediately felt blocked. My eardrums felt stretched, I noticed temporary 
hearing loss while wearing the mask, and as pressure increased to 5 or 6 it became painful and 
made me lightheaded. 
I tried pushing through for hours, but nothing improved. I already have a history of Eustachian 
tube dysfunction, tinnitus, and hearing loss, so this was extremely concerning. I’ve also read 
studies showing CPAP can cause barotrauma and even permanent hearing damage in some 
people, which makes me very hesitant to continue. 
I even checked my ears with a Bebird ear camera just to make sure nothing obvious like wax 
blockage was contributing, and everything looked normal. This really seems like a pressure 
equalization issue rather than something external. 
The sleep clinic suggested switching to an oral appliance, but I’m worried about long term jaw 
and teeth alignment problems, especially since I already have other structural issues. That feels 
like trading one serious problem for another. 
I’ve wondered whether wearing earplugs with CPAP could help reduce pressure differences on 
the eardrums, or if that would make things worse. I’ve also looked into alternatives like EPAPdevices such as Bongo RX, but I don’t know whether those would be any safer for someone 
with chronic ear issues. 
I’m not asking for medical advice specific to my case. I’m trying to understand whether others 
with ETD or chronic ear problems have found ways to tolerate CPAP without worsening their 
hearing, or whether alternative treatments ended up being the better route. 
Is this just how my body reacts to pressure changes, or is there some approach I’m missing? 
Any shared experiences would really help right now.",1767547040.0,28,4,SleepApnea,sleep

1q3usri,Persistent nasal blockage,"I've been dealing with persistent nasal congestion issues that are seriously impacting my BiPAP therapy, and I'm running out of ideas. Here's what I'm dealing with and what I've already tried.

# Current Setup & Problems

**Equipment:** AirCurve 11, P30i nasal pillows, currently at 13/9 pressure (S mode)

**Two nasal issues:**

1. **Positional blockage:** One nostril completely blocks when lying down on that side - this seems manageable with adequate pressure because I can get enough air in one nostril
2. **Whole-nose blockage:** Both nostrils feel increasingly dry and blocked as the night progresses, worst in the morning usually

**Recent experience:** 8am this morning, my nose felt so dry and blocked that inhaling felt like heavy labor. I experimented with raising pressure (14/10, then 15/11) to see if that would help push through the blockage, but it didn't. I could technically breathe, but it felt extremely labored - though I'm not sure if some of that was psychological.

Despite sleeping through the night for the first time in a while, I felt terrible on waking. My Apple Watch showed lots of brief wakings I don't remember, and my Ring data still shows high AHI despite what felt like decent sleep.

# What I've Already Tried (Nothing Has Worked)

**Nasal medications (all stopped because they weren't helping):**

* Azelastine spray
* Flonase (mometasone) nasal rinse
* Afrin (even this didn't get me through the night)

**Also:**

* Saline nasal rinse nightly before bed
* Turbinate reduction with microdebrider + septoplasty (May 2025)
* Intake nasal strips nightly

**Humidity interventions:**

* Room humidifier running (ambient humidity \~40%, raised to 60%)
* BiPAP humidifier at various settings, all the way up to 8, with raised temperature

Nothing works. The blockage feels DRY, not wet/congested, which makes me think more humidity isn't the answer - though I'm open to trying even lower humidity if anyone has had success with that.

**Why I'm reluctant to raise machine temperature further:** I already feel hot with the mask, cervical collar, and headband over my mouth. Raising the temperature makes me uncomfortably warm.

Any suggestions?",1767545419.0,5,4,SleepApnea,sleep
1q3r4vp,Am I stupid to feel these emotions?,"Hi All,

  
I don't know where else to post this and don't want to be the guy complaining when things 'work'. Please if it's not here and should go to a psychology post just tell me. But if some of you have been through what I feel or have idea I am all ears. 

  
So I'll be quick for the sleep apnea part. M37, being diagnosed with sleep apnea in June, severe  (just enough ahah at 30). Was hard for me, got into cpap, took me fucking months, analyzed, I am almost becoming a sleep specialist at this point and I would actually like to help other. Anyway. So I do feel better, more rested but I feel weird about it. 

I try to sum up:

\- I Feel like my past life has been robbed, and I ""miss"" being able to enjoy my early thirties, I am mad against Drs, myself, my body and as I have more energy I spend it fueling this anger. Which is stupid

\- I Feel like now i am old(er), I missed my dating period, no one would like to sleep with someone attached to a tube (altough I firmly believe this is stupid and nothing really that bad, it's only at night, and I am way more healthy), And that also means if I don't use it /can't, I am basically not dating material. 

\- I am scared anywway one day Cpap will just stop working for me. And here we go again, so I should do many things RIGHT NOW. I am basically behaving like I have hypomania (so basically super excited to do everything I can, because being tired as fuck will come back one day)

I feel stupid for reacting like that. And yes, I have a/am seening psychologist, but i want to hear it from people that might go through that. It's impossible to really understand otherwise, I feel. 

Anything that helped for those who feel that ?

1q3kc2x,How much did getting treated help your stress levels/mental health?,"I’m about to possibly have a sleep study done because for the second year in a row I’ve had a lot of things line up where my doctor says I might have sleep apnea and has urged me to get a sleep study done. 

While waiting for the initial consultation appointment, I’ve just wondered more and more about how much of my problems in life directly tie back to sleep apnea. I’ve always had mental health problems to one degree or another such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, etc. And I’ve always had insomnia to some degree, but for the past couple years my sleep seems to just be getting worse and worse. It takes me over 12 hours to feel fully rested, IF I can get that, because even if setting aside time on a day off my body often just won’t let me. I take prescription sleep meds just to fall asleep at all, wake up sweaty or out of breath about four hours later, have to take more and just pray I fall asleep again and then the third time. 

I’ve also been dealing with a ton of constant stress and burnout due to a very demanding degree program after going back to school. It feels like all of the life has left me. I give everything I have to school and am completely drained after, it feels like my life falls apart on the regular and I never have enough energy to fully pick it back up again. I’m just shuffling around life like a corpse half the time, living in survival mode, and not getting to take care of myself enough or enjoy life at all. I often wonder what’s even the point anymore. I don’t even feel like a person anymore sometimes, I have no room in my life left to *be* a person once I get the bare minimums of the day done. Especially since developing a bunch of other health problems the past couple years, many of which likely tie back to PMDD that I didn’t have before then. Also extra inflammation, low iron, etc. My body and mind are just completely disintegrating it feels like. 

All of this to say, at this point it feels as if I’m banking on whatever treatment I get working if I do have sleep apnea, because I’m completely out of options if it doesn’t. 

All this to say, for those who have successfully gotten treatment for sleep apnea and gotten better, how much of a difference did it make in your ability to handle life’s stressors? How much did it improve your mental state, energy levels, physical health, etc.? I’ve been like this so long I can no longer remember what it’s like to truly have life behind my eyes for more than maybe some one-off really good days. I wonder how much time I could get back in my day, if I weren’t spending it trying and failing to sleep for literally half of my 24 hours. I thought my problems were mostly just due to stress and burnout as well as getting older…but what if it never had to be this way? It feels like I’m banking on a miracle, but part of me doesn’t want to hold my breath yet. Idk how applicable my situation is to everyone else’s, but I’d love some words of encouragement or success stories if anyone does have them. ",1767513889.0,6,4,SleepApnea,sleep

I've been consistently losing weight for the last year or so and starting sometime last month, my humidifier started leaking way faster and my mouth was getting extremely dry. I adjusted my mask to be tighter and I woke up with a compression headache, I tried adding a different humidifier to the room but it turns out the humidity in the room wasn't the problem at all.

I realized that my problem is definitely a mouth leak-- my jaw drops when I get to a certain point of sleep. So, I bought a chin strap on Amazon. It was an adjustable one, but it seems to be too small for my head, since it caused another compression headache for me. 

Looking at my sleep study results (which are from quite a while ago), there's no mention of where my obstruction comes from with my apnea so mouth taping seems very dangerous, if there's a nasal component to my obstructive apnea. Plus, whenever I'd get the sniffles, that could be a problem.

My finances are super limited right now so I'm sort of at my wit's end. I can't just keep trying different chin straps since they can get pricey, especially if I have to end up buying five of them before I \*might\* find one that works, and tape is cheap but potentially really dangerous.

My thought at this point is to try adjusting the bottom straps on my mask frame to be tighter rather than focusing on the top ones, which is what I did before.

I have been told to be snoring heavily for years which I thought was due to me being overweight, that may very well be the reason along with a couple of problems in my airway according to my last doctor examination, but since last year I was warned about stops during my breaths by my ex and my mother when I visited her.

I have investigated a lot and I think I will go with Löwenstein machines, still waiting for my doctors advice on what type of machine I should be getting. So I can see that heated tubes and humidifiers are not a must but recommended for a much more pleasant experience using the machines. Honestly I have also been dealing a lot with chronic cough that has never gone away for more than a year, that is another area I am seeking help from my doctor but still nothing seems wrong with my lungs.

1q2kqbw,20M – Severe issues started right after tonsillectomy/septoplasty. UARS/Sleep Apnea?,"
Hey everyone, I’ve been struggling for about 2.5 years with crippling fatigue, brain fog, and dizziness, especially during/after exercise. I’m a very healthy 20 y/o male and had zero issues before surgery. 

All symptoms started immediately after a tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, and septoplasty.

I’ve seen multiple doctors and ENTs, had tons of blood work, and two sleep studies, but I only slept 2–3 hours in each and never reached REM, so they were labeled “normal,” which feels inconclusive (especially for UARS which is very dependent on REM).

A recent ENT found:
	•Small septal perforation
	•Slight septal re-deviation
	•Mild left nasal valve collapse

He said it’s “minor” but offered septorhinoplasty to help breathing. I also grew up with tongue thrust, which basically my tongue sits more down/forward than it’s supposed to, so I’m wondering if removing my tonsils changed how my tongue/airway behaves during sleep. I feel slight relief from nasal breathing strips, but not significant relief.

Questions:
	•What should my next step be because I can’t sleep during sleep studies?
	•Could my nose issues be causing UARS? Would septorhinoplasty realistically improve sleep breathing?
      •Are nasal or mouth breathing issues more likely for me?
	•Does this sound like UARS or something else?

1q2bl7o,"New diagnosis, looking for info and guidance","I’ve been having fatigue since before I was 17yrs old, but when I started driving I started experiencing uncontrollable fatiguing when driving, reading, or watching tv. And now over 10 years later I finally get a diagnosis.

Last month I completed my night study. As soon as they closed the door and turned the light off I started having a panic attack. They gave me 6hrs 10mins to get 6 hours of sleeep. It took me 55 mins to calm down to fall asleep and the study says I only wanna slept for just under 3 hours. Every time I was aware of being asleep I would wake up.

The results say I had 21-22 AHI/sleep events per hour with a significant oxygen desaturation of 85%. They recommended an apap, weight loss, mouth guard, and inspire (an implanted device).

I don’t think the results are fully wrong. I suspected some level of apnea and my dr was trying to rule out different sleep disorders (apnea, narcolepsy, restless leg, hypersomnia, etc). But I don’t know if I fully trust the results to be comprehensive because I was so anxious it did not feel representative of a normal night of sleep.

One of the treatment recommendations is to lose weight. I’ve been trying to lose weight since I was in high school at 165lbs, reached a highest of 265, and now I’m 255lbs. Weight loss isn’t going to be an option for me cause I’ve been trying my whole life and I just can’t do it effectively enough. Besides a thyroid disorder, I’m physically healthy and moderately active.

I’m curious about the differences between different models of CPAP’s vs APAP, inspire implantable device, and mouth guard option. What resources do you recommend me looking into? Any info about insurance coverage? What about rent to own devices? I’m overwhelmed and don’t want to make any poor choices.

1q29xsp,SOS-Advice needed,"Long time listener, first time caller. I am struggling with my sleep apnea, and I really don't know what to do. 

  
Background: I have severe sleep apnea (I have 1000 events a night according to my sleep study). I have been diagnosed for over a year now. My main issue is that I am continuing to take my mask unconsciously off around 2 hours into my sleep. Like I would wake up without my mask on with no memory of how it got off. 

I began with a CPAP machine and then got a BiPAP, hoping that would fix things, but it hasn't. I have tried multiple different masks (I am a mouth breather), and from the sleep study, I would continue to wake up and panic, and rip off my mask. Even if I had someone to wake me up to put my mask back on, I would continue to take it off every 2 hours or so.  I have tried melatonin and a plethora of other sleep aids. 

Has anyone experienced this? I know it takes time to get used to the mask, but this feels excessive.

I am having another sleep study soon and possibly going to a different machine. I have snored most of my adult life, but recently I got an office job and gained around 25 lbs. My previous job a moved around a lot more. I am currently working to shed some of that weight, but my doctor says  I would most likely still have sleep apnea even after losing weight. 

  
I also have moderately low T, and I am working with my Endochronologist to get that addressed. I know that it is definitely not helping my sleep, and vice versa. I also have Adrenal Insufficiency and Hypothyroidism in context. 

  
I just wanted to get some advice and see if anyone else has been through this. It is getting to the point where I am dozing off while driving and sometimes at work. 

  
Do I just need to hit the gym? Should I just keep sticking with it? I apologize for all that info, and thank you in advance.

1q28i49,I think my test results are incorrect,"I scored 15 Epworth sleepiness questionnaire. Have dealt with insomnia for eleven years and have a reccesed lower jaw that I have been referred for treatment in the future for surgury as it is affecting my health and mental well being. I have received my result today that tells me, ODI 0.3/hour → very low (normal is typically <5) Average SpO₂ 93% → slightly low-normal during sleep, but not alarming by itself Snore index 14.5% → indicates snoring, but snoring alone. I was given my test without nose cannulas to measure air flow. Sorry to include to following but I had to turn to chatgpt for more information as I am a full time carer, very desperate and would like this to be fixed. It had wrote the following:

A home sleep test without a nasal cannula has important limitations.

Why this can underestimate sleep apnea
Nasal cannulas measure airflow. Without one, the device is usually relying on:

Oxygen drops (ODI)

Movement or effort sensors

Sometimes snoring vibration

This means:

Hypopneas without oxygen desaturation can be missed

Flow limitation (a key feature of mild OSA and UARS) is often not detected

Events that cause arousals but not SpO₂ drops won’t show up

So an ODI of 0.3/hour is reassuring for moderate–severe OSA, but it does not reliably rule out:

Mild obstructive sleep apnea

UARS

Positional or REM-related breathing problems

Your SpO₂ and snoring
Average SpO₂ 93% is acceptable but slightly low for a healthy sleeper

Snore index 14.5% suggests upper airway resistance, even if apnea wasn’t captured

Should you request another test?
Yes, it is reasonable to request further evaluation if you have symptoms, especially because:

The test lacked airflow measurement

Home tests are known to miss mild disease

The most informative next step would be:

In-lab polysomnography.

1q10pd1,"Differing test results, not sure what to do","Hello, halfway through last year I decided to get sleep studies done as I’ve been struggling with tiredness and memory loss for years and have tried many other tests with no answers. I got a private test done and also got one done on the NHS too for good measure.

For context I’m 25M, not overweight, don’t drink or smoke. I exercise regularly, eat decently healthy however have had breathing issues all my life (asthma) which my dad also has. We both sleep poorly and I often wake up feeling exhausted and foggy, headaches, dry mouth etc.

Anyway the private test came back as positive for OSA, with an AHI of 26.4. I bought a CPAP machine and have been using that for the past 6/7 months. I’ve spent quite a lot of money on this machine and have had months of broken sleep nights trying to use it (I’ve really struggled to fall asleep with it), but I have found that the odd night I am able to use it I feel amazing the next day.

Things were generally looking up and I thought I’d found the answer to my tiredness when suddenly the NHS got back to me 8 months later and told me that there was no evidence of OSA or breathing issues in my sleep study that I did with them.

Has anyone had something similar happen to them? What should I do?",1767261253.0,4,6,SleepApnea,sleep

Has anyone's chronic pain been greatly improved after addressing OSA? If so, can you share your story, so I can encourage my daughter to give CPAP another try?

Long version (it's 1:45 am, so this might be toooooo long)
My 23 yr old daughter has a connective tissue disorder that is associated with OSA, so she did a home sleep test with Lofta in December 2023. Her results were ""Mild to severe based on pAHI=7.5, pRDI=30.5 and 02 nadir of 84%""
We got her a cpap machine, I believe an airsense, and she tried to adapt to it, but as a then 21 year old with a lot of physical and mental health  concerns, she never learned to tolerate it despite trying multiple masks. Her pain has continued unabated, and I am wondering if I should encourage her to try again with the cpap machine in hopes that it will help with her pain. 
She is currently in two kinds of PT, MH treatment, trying acupuncture, on multiple pain meds, and waiting on a referral for a pain management MD, so one more thing might be too much even now. But if getting used to it could help with her pain, I will urge her to try again. 
Also, if she does try again, the cpap has sat untouched for months, with water in it (I know this was unwise to say the least) is it possible to clean it, or should we plan on buying a new one?

I called right as my Dermatologist appointment was finishing up and the sleep doc had already left (it was 4PM New Years eve) but he did look at my study results.

His receptionist said she could not share my medical info (HIPPA) but said I needed to come in and see the Doc ASAP. So we scheduled an appointment in two days. I said to her ""I know you can't share medical info with me but...say you were unfortunate enough to sleep next to me (LOL) would I be snoring and choking (I wake up choking all the time) all night?""

She laughed and said ""Yes. we use a green to orange to red zone range and you are way, way into the red zone."" 

So that means I am waking up more than 30 times every hour. I am always exhausted so I am highly motivated to use a CPAP. However that is where my question comes in.

Every single person on this and other forums recommend purchasing a unit outright. The Resmed11 is on sale today for $475! However, how do I approach my doc?

21M looking for some guidance.I usually can’t nap as my mind races, and I feel too anxious, but this afternoon I was extremely exhausted and actually got close to falling asleep. I had taken my ADHD medication earlier, which seemed to calm my thoughts, and also my nasal breathing was better than usual despite having a chronically stuffy nose and a deviated septum.  
  
As I started drifting off and breathing more deeply, I noticed snoring-like noises coming from the back of my throat. I’ve attached an MP3 recording of what it sounds like here: 

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/14oVvTzsRR3RU98M6mLLE6GPSn7bJnzxY/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14oVvTzsRR3RU98M6mLLE6GPSn7bJnzxY/view?usp=sharing) 

I also noticed intermittent sensations of my throat feeling obstructed, along with periods where I would exhale and then not inhale again for a few seconds.

I previously did a WatchPAT ONE home sleep test, which was inconclusive. There was no AHI reported, but my RDI was 7.8 throughout the night: [https://imgur.com/a/an5OFys](https://imgur.com/a/an5OFys)   
  
My  symptoms include: Never waking up feeling refreshed, severe fatigue and brain fog,  cold hands and feet, poor libido/ ED, GI issues despite a very healthy diet, Frequent nighttime urination, extremely light/fragmented sleep, and daytime nasal breathing difficulty   
I’m also diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and ADHD.   
  
I’m planning to pursue an in-lab PSG, but given that the WatchPAT shows no apnea, I wanted to see if anyone here has experienced similar symptoms or has insight into what this suggests. My family has said they’ve never heard me snore so this is odd. Any thoughts on next steps, specialists to see, or specific questions to ask doctors would be appreciated.

Since then, I have lost about 70lbs and have had a new sleep test. While my AHI is now normal (2.7), my RDI remains elevated (16.9). My understanding in talking to the respiratory therapist about my results is that the elevated RDI is an issue because it produces fragmented sleep and prevents extended bouts of deep sleep. The issue that I'm seeing is that my CPAP usage does not seem to be doing anything to improve my fragmented sleep and I have never experienced the sense of rejuvenated sleep since I started with the CPAP that I expected. As you can see from the photos below the night where I used my CPAP (12/28) actually had more interruptions than the night (12/31) where I did not use the CPAP. I use my CPAP reliably every night, but my Apple Watch continually flags me with a high number of sleep interruptions.

At this point, I'm not certain what questions I should be asking about my sleep, CPAP usage, or other potential steps, so I would be grateful for any recommendations that folks might have.

1q0k5r2,Any advice on keeping the mask on?,"Hi I hope everyones doing well!

I got diagnosed with extremely severe sleep apnea close to a year ago now and I have a cpap machine. I have a couple different masks and sizes for the masks and I wear it consistently every single night but I just cannot keep it on. I don't know if it comes off or if I take it off but it is extremely rare for me to get more than 3 hours a night with it on. I tried taping the mask to my head I got so desperate but I still wake up with it off!

I went to my specialist yo ask for advice and the only things I haven't done that they suggested was wearing mittens (which just seems too uncomfortable for me) and setting an alarm to wake me up to put it back on (which frankly seems to defeat the purpose if I cant get uninturrupted sleep). Also honestly my specialist kinda sucks and I am looking to move to another one as they just seem interested in throwing a cpap machine at me and leaving me out to dry with little follow-up. Hopefully, I can find one after the holidays are over.

Some extra context that might help: I have a mysterious sinus issue where I basically have post-nasal drip and plugged ears chronically. Went to an ENT years ago and they said I am fine (obviously I am not lol). I have a suspicion that my apnea is related to me sort of choking on mucus while I sleep or something along those lines. I have an appointment with a new ENT next week so hopefully I get more info soon.

Thank you to anyone who read all that. If anyone has any tricks for keeping the mask on or has experienced a situation similar to mine I would appreciate any and all advice!

- Mask fit and feel. I'm struggling with silicone masks making me feel sweaty or not sitting 'right' on my face. I hate the feeling of too much on my face.

- F&P Simplus - Medium was too big, small too small!
- Resmed F30 - Hated the bit under my nose

- Resmed F20, both airtouch and airfit - the foam one is the best mask so far, but I'm struggling with the feeling on my chin. Currently using this but only managing around 2-3 hours per night
- Resmed N30 - For some reason this hurt my nose, even when very loose
- Resmed N20 - Most comfortable nasal mask, but I've been getting headaches, I think from tensing my jaw and using a chin strap overnight.

> • During your sleep study, you stopped breathing or did not breathe deeply enough 17.4 times per hour (on average). 

> • Your lowest oxygen level was 78%.  A normal oxygen level is above 88%.  Your oxygen level was below 89% for a total of 22.5 minutes. 
>  
> Given these results, I recommend that you use CPAP with a pressure range of 5-15 cmH2O when you sleep.  We will send a prescription to AdaptHealth for the CPAP machine and supplies.

1q0i9t9,Having Inspire surgery this Friday (Jan 2nd '26),"About me: 49 y/o 5'9 170lb. I've been on CPAP since 2019, but probably developed sleep apnea in my early 20's. When diagnosed, I was close to 200lbs and had an AHI of 60. Initially put on BiPAP at 20 cmH2O. It was a lot of pressure and I struggled with it for 2 years trying different masks, pillows, etc. 

I had enough and went to see if there was a surgical option. Found out I had a deviated septum (original ENT never looked) so I had balloon sinuplasty. The doc did warn that I could see diminishing returns as time goes on. That helped a lot, the air could move through my sinus without so much resistance. 

I was able to use a sinus pillow and move from BiPAP to CPAP on auto pressure. Everything was good until about the last year. I started waking up more often, feeling like I couldn't breath. Having another sinuplasty was something I could not tolerate so I started researching Inspire.

I went back and forth with the idea of the implant and had multiple discussions with my wife about it. During that time, I bucked down and lost weight (204 > 168) to at least minimize that affect. After about 6 months of being on the fence, and weight loss not fixing the problem, I decided to just do it.

Talked to my pulmonologist and they said I was a candidate, so then I had an ENT consult. The doc ordered a sleep study to make sure I still had at least moderate sleep apnea since I lost a bunch of weight. The weight loss did help at least since I went from severe to moderate. Then they did an in-office scope to see if it was worth moving forward. I got the green light there, so the next step was to get a scope while under anesthesia. Had that done, and they approved me for Inspire.

I'm not nervous about surgery, but I am nervous that I get it and my sleep doesn't get any better. Because once the device is in, it's staying in. I am hopeful though, and not having to sleep with anything on my face and maintain or travel with a CPAP, is a nice thought. I'll update with progress after the surgery. Thanks for reading, and have a Happy New Year.

Update 1: Immediate post-op. Chest incision site is sore, hurts to swallow, and my neck feels like a horse kicked it lol. Feeling like it’s going to be a liquid diet for me for the next 24-48hrs. 

Update 2: 24hrs post-op neck and tongues still swollen, but it's a little easier to swallow. Not enough to switch to solid food though. Sleep was okay, but having having your head elevated definitely helps reduce the strain on your neck when sitting up. I only notice the chest implant if I touch it or reach too far with my right hand. I'd take this any day over how I felt the next day after balloon sinuplasty.",1767201611.0,8,5,SleepApnea,sleep

I did the study almost three years ago through Lofta since that was cheaper and faster than going through insurance.  It turned out I had severe OSA with an AHI of 38.  I started using a CPAP and felt amazingly better within a week or two once I got used to the mask.  The therapy works and my AHI as reported by my Airsense 11 is under 2 every night. 

Five months ago I started Zepbound, mainly for weight loss as my OSA is under control with the CPAP.  I've managed to drop almost 60 pounds but could still drop another 80+.  If I doze off in the recliner I no longer snore myself awake.  I can go for a night or two without the CPAP (travel) and not feel like utter crap like I would a couple years ago.  I was also finding that I was waking up from the CPAP pressure forcing my mouth open (nasal pillow mask).  I lowered my pressures (self titrated with OSCAR) and my AHI is still under 2.

I did find Zepbound eliminated the mild arthritis pain in my knees within 48 hours of the first dose, so the anti-inflammatory effects are real and it is not just weight loss that fixes things.

The sleep specialist I was seeing said it was pretty high and sent me to a level one test at the hospital and I don’t know if those machines are just more accurate or what’s going on but within an hour of me falling asleep, they woke me up and hooked me up to a CPAP and I got the results back like a few weeks later.

1pzxiyi,Can the CPAP machine of my neighbor make buzzing sounds on my apartment?,"I will elaborate further the title.

Last weeks, I keep hearing like an electric buzz in my bedroom. I checked all electric connections on my apartment, and everything is fine. I was able to detect that the buzz comes from one of the corners of the upstairs apartment, so my neighbors bedroom.
The buzzing is soft enough that I only notice it during the night, once all other noises are off, but is noticeable enough to wake me up during the nights.

Before directly confronting my upstairs neighbor, I wanted to know if the buzz/vibrations can be from a CPAP machine, maybe by laying directly in the floor without any sound-proof base or smth. Can that be the case? Or is impossible it can be from a CPAP machine and I should just ask him to check his wirings?

1pzvc8j,Oxygen question,"I did a weeklong oximetry test without a mask that showed I my O2 sats went below 88 as much as 55 minutes a night. My sats sunk as low as 82 and 84. 

So the pulmonologist prescribed 1 L of oxygen to be used with or without BiPAP. 15 minutes before it was supposed to be delivered, though, I got a call from the durable medical equipment company. They said that my oximetry test would likely not pass muster with insurance since it wasn’t done with a mask. So my doctor says I need to do an oximetry test all over again with a mask on all night. 

Here’s the rub: I can’t wear any mask. I’ve tried every different type for years and I can’t wear one for longer than an 90 minutes. Something happens at that mark and I wake up and have to take it off. I fall asleep for several more hours and then try again for another 90 minutes. I’ve had titration studies and the same thing happens. 

The hope was that a bit of oxygen would help me keep the mask on. But I can’t get it unless I keep a mask on all night and show that my oxygen is still below 88. I can’t keep a mask on all night, and if I could, of course my sats would be higher! 

Have any of you been successful getting supplemental oxygen without an oximetry test on a CPAP or BiPAP? Can I just get a prescription and pay for a concentrator out of pocket? I assume it’s ungodly expensive. 

I’m so frustrated I actually cried when I got the news. I am killing my brain with no oxygen at night, and my father had the same syndrome and died a horrible death from Alzheimer’s and Lewy Body.

1pzozaw,2.5 Months In - What I wish I knew (AHI96/Spo2 66%),"I wanted to share my story a little bit because I would have loved to see something like this, a little 3 month later follow up.

**What I wish I knew**

CPAP **will** feel easier to wear -- you just need to bare it for a bit. The feelings of having air shoved down your throat will end, this will be fixed once your muscles start to be able to ""fight"" the machine better. I suspect that people who run lots wont have anywhere near as tough a time lol.

**I wish I had a heads up about the muscle pain** \-- Related to fighting the machine, my lungs would feel so worn out in the morning to the point where I wanted to not breathe lol to rest. This mostly resolved after 6 days and fixed after 4 weeks. This was particularly bad for me because my machine settings were like 16.

**Dreaming will be intense** \-- Especially initially. I had night terrors, ones where I thought I woke up and the machine was like killing me or something. Terrible shit. These slowed down and became less frequent, I'm still getting a bit of sleep paralysis sometimes but I'm working through that and will talk to my doctor.

**Energy Levels** \-- I can do more than one thing a day. I used to be able to just go shopping and then not cook when I came home. Today I went shopping, cooked paella, worked -- no issues whatsoever.

**The amount of sleep** \-- The amount of sleep you need will decrease by a bit, down from like 10 hours to like 7-8.

**It won't fix everything** \-- I still feel like I have chronic fatigue, but instead of being like 30% of everyone else I'm about 80%. That initial second wind was really encouraging but didn't last -- that said I'm better than I've ever been.

My Memory Feels worse but probably isn't -- I'm remembering that I don't remember stuff now. Which feels like it's worse than It was, but I suspect my memory was just really bad from the OSA  and this is part of healing.

Veritgo -- I had transient vertigo for the first month. I chalked it up to my brain healing, turns out it's likely something to do with ear canal. Eitherway, heads up re that. It was only while I was walking though.

Both my uncle and dad have severe sleep apnoea diagnosed.

Current info:
My partner is concerned due to feeling my chest concave and snoring whilst falling asleep on my side spooning her. She’s more concerned as it usually happens when I’m laid on my back. 

Symptoms: 
I don’t have any of the usual symptoms of sleep apnoea. The other symptoms could be a result or hidden by medications I take (morning tiredness cause by night time meds and then day time awareness by morning meds) 

The symptoms I do show is 
- funky breathing at night/concaving chest trying to breath
- sometimes (not often) I stop breathing and gasp for SHORT seconds
- partner wakes me up to check if I’m okay but I say I’m okay and go straight back to the same sleep breathing
- mild snoring (but my high levels of snoring is my uncle and dad which vibrates the house) 
- rarely I wake up with a sharpness which usually I realise I’ve breathed in 

I don’t show any morning headaches, no nocturnal wees, I have nightmares/vivid dreams most of my life so I do wake up a fair bit regularly, no daytime sleepiness at all

can I do anything at home without going to doctors straight away to measure issues with sleep?

1pysjio,Tape not working to keep mouth shut,"Hey everyone, I'm at a loss and hoping someone has dealt with this.

**Background:** Mild OSA (AHI \~8), had tonsillectomy in 2022 which dropped me from severe to mild. Currently on AirCurve 11 BiPAP at 10/7, using P10 nasal pillows.

**The problem:** My tongue drops off the roof of my mouth during REM sleep, which lets air rush into my mouth and wakes me up. This happens even with:

* Mouth tape (kinesiology tape horizontal + Cover Roll cheek-to-cheek)
* Cervical collar
* Chin strap
* All three combined

The tape gets wet/fails, or air just pushes through anyway. I have a beard which complicates the seal.

**Full face mask** isn't an option - I tried the F20 and couldn't get it to seal with my facial hair. Leaks were worse than the mouth opening issue.

**What I've tried that didn't work:**

* Suction-based tongue stabilizer (uncomfortable, didn't keep tongue positioned high enough)
* ZQuiet MAD (helps with jaw position but tongue still drops)
* MouthShield (painful)
* Various chin strap configurations

**Current theory:** Maybe if I can fix my tongue positioning I can fix the mouth opening, because it seems that if my tongue is in place on roof of my mouth, my mouth won't open. The problem is that my tongue does NOT stay there when I go into REM sleep, especially in the early morning. Even when my jaw stays mostly closed, my mouth opens and breaks the seal that would direct air into my lungs.

Has anyone solved this specific issue? I'm looking at devices like the Airwaav (shelf-based tongue positioning) or potentially the iNAP negative pressure device. Or is there a taping technique I'm missing?

I'm 6+ months post-turbinate/septum surgery so nasal breathing is better than it's ever been, but I still need the BiPAP pressure to breathe adequately.

1pyq59a,Can someone please decipher oscar data/ general advice for my situation,"Background; 26 years old. Diagnosed in 2020 but havent really used cpap regularly until recently. have been tired since i was a 5 years old,  mouth breather, could never sleep, no one believed me. They would try to give me drugs to stay awake instead. Im miserable but after this long im just used to being tired.

Im not overweight 6""2/ 190lb, dentist says i have a small airway and big tongue. I dont want to use cpap but am not offered any alternatives.

My AHI wont go below 5. i have dreamstation with the full face mask since i mouth breathe. I hate using the CPAP and i have to travel frequently for work which makes things inconvenient. Sleep study showed right side has dramatically lower AHI but for the life of me i can't stay on the right i keep ending up on my back

AHI was 40 on sleep test. What data would be helpful for you guys?

1pyq1uv,I am cured of sleep apnea.....IF I move to sea level. Anyone else in this situation?,"Currently live in Denver, and have been in other parts of Colorado for almost 11 years. 

About 16 or so years ago when I lived in Pennsylvania I got a sleep test done in the lab with all the wires and it didn't show any apneas at all. 

Went to my sleep doctor here in Denver and had them order me a watch pat one with the explicit intent that I use it when I traveled back east to Pennsylvania last month. I wanted to see what the results are at sea level. 

Turns out I show no signs of apnea whatsoever at sea level. Also a few weeks after Pennsylvania, I spent a few days in Chicago and even though I didn't have a sleep test done there my smart devices showed significantly improved scores compared to sleeping in Denver and mentally and physically I felt much improved. 

So it's possible that my wife and I would be moving somewhere at sea level in the next year or two. 

The lack of oxygen really does cause the apnea. Has anyone else who lives in an elevated area experienced no apneas at sea level?

1py9bxi,Needing encouragement,"Long story short I’ve had CFS for 12 years and Long Covid for 3 years. I had a sleep study done a few years back and it was negative for sleep apnea. 

Since developing Long Covid, I’ve gained a lot of weight. Recently I purchased a smart ring and sure enough it showed I have signs of mild to moderate sleep apnea. The fatigue I have felt since Long Covid started plus the weight gain, has been insane. The CFS fatigue by itself that I’ve had for over a decade, definitely feels a lot different than what I’m experiencing now. I’m so drowsy all the time and have to nap most days. I sleep pretty well but wake up feeling hung over, drowsy and exhausted. 

So essentially I’m experiencing CFS fatigue, mixed with long covid fatigue mixed with sleep apnea fatigue. It’s a brutal combination. 

I saw the ENT a few weeks ago. He said I have small airways, and the questionnaire I took showed signs of sleep apnea so he ordered a sleep study. Just waiting to hear back. I think I’m just feeling frustrated that I’m having to deal with another medical issue. I know sleep apnea is easily treated but it just feels daunting. I just want this to be worth it. 

For those of you who were suffering with severe fatigue, did treating the sleep apnea with a CPAP help to a point to where your quality of life improved? I was also curious if it has helped anyone lose weight? I feel like my body is in a vicious cycle. I’ve recovered a lot from the CFS/long covid but the severe fatigue is the only thing that’s still giving me issues. So I’m praying this will help me. Just overwhelmed I guess. 

TLDR: if you had severe fatigue, did treating sleep apnea make a huge difference? What were some of the changes you saw? Any weight loss?

1py0zp8,I don’t think I’ll ever get enough REM,"I need to vent. I was diagnosed with sleep apnea over the summer after having a PSG and an MSLT. When I was a teenager I started to fall asleep in a lot of my classes. I would have to fight to stay awake, and from the moment I woke all I could think about was getting back to bed. When my alarm would go off I would fall asleep again while going through the 7 stages of grief. I would get genuinely upset and I would be in denial that it was actually morning and I had to leave my bed that felt like a fluffy cloud. I would get woken up again by my mom, and then again about 10 minutes later by her blinding me by opening the shades and ripping my blankets off. I would finally get up and put my clothes on only to be jump scared by her screaming “Are you kidding me! It is blank o’clock, get out of bed!” because I wasn’t actually out of bed and getting ready, my brain tricked me into thinking that by dreaming it instead of letting me do it! Sometimes I would get up and pretend I was in the bathroom and lay on the bathroom floor and sleep, until she figured it out. I wasn’t the type of kid who didn’t care about being late to school either I was very studious, but the urge to sleep was too strong. In my later teens I was finally diagnosed with ADHD (which is a whole other story) and was put on stimulant medication. This helped a lot with keeping me awake during the day, but it did nothing to get me out of bed in the morning even if I took it right after the first alarm. Fast forward to my adult years and I cannot get anywhere on time if I have to leave my house before 2pm. I have to set anywhere from 13-20 alarms in the morning because if it goes off when I’m in REM or N3 i either can hear it in my sleep but can’t wake up (I know this is probably sleep paralysis), I’ll wake up and can’t tell the difference between snooze and stop and hit the wrong one or fall asleep trying to decide, or I will silence them without any recollection of doing so. There were many occasions that I woke up to my parents telling me that my work had contacted them to see if I was okay. On weekends I sleep for about 12 hours without feeling refreshed. Anyways I had all the testing done over the summer and got a diagnosis of sleep apnea. During the at home one I only had 3 events, but during the PSG I had an AHI of 7.8 and a REM AHI of 17.8. The RDI was the same number so I’m guessing that they didn’t pay much attention to that (I’m a petite woman and am told that RDI is usually higher in UARS, and that some doctors don’t recognize that diagnosis). I only had 1 obstructive apnea, but I had 11 central apneas and what looks like 74 obstructive hypopneas. I also had 184 PLMs. I had a total of 36 awakenings and 275 arousals. They let me sleep as long as I wanted so my total sleep time was almost 12 hours, but my REM latency was 379 minutes. I went to bed around 11 and fell asleep about an hour later and didn’t hit REM UNTIL 6AM, WHICH IS WHEN MY FIRST ALARM GOES OFF ON SOME DAYS! NO WONDER I CANT GET OUT OF BED SOMETIMES, ITS BECAUSE IM LITERALLY PARALYZED! On the days the alarm goes off earlier, it’s a strong possibility that I don’t get REM sleep at all! So I’ve been on the cpap machine for about three months now and I have seen very little improvement, even though the highest my AHI has ever been on it is 2.6. Very rarely do i ever get more than a 1. I just got something called Whoop for Christmas (not advertising, it’s actually very annoying to use) and it tracks my sleep stages. According to Whoop I am still getting extremely little REM and N3 sleep despite my low AHI! I’m talking like only 5% of my 9 hour slumber was REM sleep. Does the CPAP machine not detect hypopneas?

1py0obk,Started CPAP 4 Nights Ago - Not sure what to make of it,"Hello to my fellow UARS/Sleep Apnea sufferers,

I had just recently started CPAP therapy for Sleep Apnea/UARS about 4 nights ago, really UARS because my AHI index was quite low and it was more my RDI numbers that were of concern. For background I had done 3 sleep tests in my life: 

1. Home study in April of 2023 when I first suspected sleeping difficulties - AHI 5.2 and RDI of 13.3, total sleep time of 7 hours 16 minutes

2. Home study again in April of 2025 a few weeks post septum surgery - AHI 3.1 and RDI of 10.9, total sleep time of 6 hours and 7 minutes

3. A lab study in September of 2025 - Don't have results for this, sleeping in the lab was so uncomfortable I felt like I barely slept but according to my nurse practitioner I slept for 20-30 minutes and it was sufficient for a sleep apnea diagnosis (or UARS who knows)

I finally decided to go ahead and purchase a CPAP for the third time, and this time around I am actually able to tolerate wearing the mask and breathing and falling asleep with it. I tried nasal pillows and hybrid masks in the past but turns out full-face seems to work best for me. With all of that being said, I do notice something different in the last 4 mornings. The groggy feeling has changed and even though I'm still tired I don't feel like I got hit by a truck when I woke up or like I got no sleep. But with that said, I still haven't felt any of the cognitive benefits like mental clarity, relief from depression and crippling anxiety etc. The anxiety part kills me, because I feel like I can't talk to people and be confident or the best version of myself. My body shakes and I hyperventilate in these situations and even though I know I'm fine my body can't just relax or relax. There is also a girl I really like in the picture and I'm hoping that I can fix this in the next week or so so I can take her out. I know I must have been dealing with this for years and probably since I was even a child, I'm 24 years old and male, so I know asking to feel better in the next week may sound like a lot.

1pxofs3,"Two sleep studies + ENT review: mild OSA on paper, but very different picture in practice","Hi everyone,

Posting this in case it helps others, and because I’m trying to sanity-check the conclusions.

In May 2024 I underwent a full in-lab hospital sleep study. The diagnosis was mild obstructive sleep apnea with an AHI of 11.0/h, but the overall sleep quality was poor. Sleep efficiency was only 72%, and I had 63 full awakenings during the night, indicating very fragmented sleep. REM sleep accounted for just 13% of total sleep time and deep sleep (N3) was 21%. Oxygenation was relatively unstable: my minimum SpO₂ dropped to 89% and the average nocturnal saturation was around 94%, with frequent short desaturations linked to events. The apnea was clearly positional, being worse in the supine position. Even though the AHI was technically mild, the night was highly disrupted and non-restorative.

In June 2025 I repeated a sleep study at home, but with full electrodes to score sleep stages, after several months using a mandibular advancement device (MAD). The device was set at **75% advancement**, which was the baseline configuration prescribed to me. Structurally, the improvement was clear. Full awakenings dropped to 18, sleep efficiency improved to around 88–90%, REM sleep doubled to 27%, and deep sleep increased to 34.8%. Oxygenation was also more stable, with a minimum SpO₂ of 93% and an average nocturnal saturation of about 96%. The report explicitly stated that there was no significant oximetric repercussion while using the device, and the apnea was no longer positional. However, the overall AHI was essentially unchanged at 10.1/h. The remaining events were now almost entirely concentrated in REM sleep, with a REM AHI of 26.2/h and a hypoxic load of 15.2% during REM.

What was striking is that despite those “good” numbers, I felt awful the next day after the study: heavy fatigue, poor concentration, and no sense of having slept well. That largely reflects my current situation. Even with the MAD, I still experience varying degrees of tiredness and sleepiness depending on the day, and I almost never wake up feeling genuinely refreshed.

After this, I had a consultation with an ENT who reviewed both studies along with my anatomy. She noted a narrow hard palate, narrow nasal passages, a crossbite, and tonsils size 2. Based on the anatomy and the evolution between studies, she classified my condition as “functional” or “dynamic” OSA rather than a clearly surgical form. She did not recommend drug-induced sleep endoscopy and felt surgery would be unlikely to provide meaningful benefit.

Her proposed plan was to continue using the MAD as baseline therapy, consider advancing it further beyond the current 75% setting to see if that reduces the REM-related events, and optionally use CPAP during periods of high work stress or when I need peak cognitive performance, rather than committing to CPAP every night.

At this point I’m trying to understand whether others here have been diagnosed with functional or dynamic OSA, particularly with REM-dominant events, and what was your course of action.",1766918463.0,8,6,SleepApnea,sleep

1pxa796,Looking for advice and similar experience- seemingly still tired,"Hi,

About 3 months ago I finally went to a sleep doctor. My wife for the past few years has been stating I stop breathing at night. Long story short, took the at home sleep test- nothing. Did an in person sleep study, less than 5 events per hour of the 5 percent oxygen drop but 40 plus events per hour dipping at the 3 percent oxygen drop, so therefore was given a cpap. I’ve been using the resmed religiously and there have only been a couple of nights where I actually feel rested.

In November I actually went back to the doctor because I was so tired in the day I was concerned it was dangerous for me to drive- it was bad. I just had another sleep study to go through titration settings… so we’ll see how that goes.
In nocemeber the doctor did adjust my pressure to a steady 7 psi, and I will say recently it has gotten better. However I still overall feel like something is not right, I still am tired, and I’m not sure what to do. 

I know there are a lot of posts on this Reddit that I’ve been reading but hoping to find someone with a similar experience that could offer insight. I’m a 36 year old male, in decent shape (not overweight) and have started going to the gym as well.

The readings on the resmed per night are good- I get close to 100 almost every night and it’s rare to have more than 1 event per hour.

History: I grind my teeth to the point of having issues with TMJ. I underwent TMJ surgery approximately 10 years ago. Because I was tired of feeling bad after waking and poor sleep, I began treatment with a pulmonologist approximately two years ago. At that time, I completed two at home tests under the care of the pulmonologist. I was told I had minor snoring but sleep apnea was not diagnosed. It was recommended that I do in lab testing. Dealing with the sleep center to schedule the in lab was difficult, resulting in months wait and no answers on price. My health insurance has denied coverage for in lab. To this day, I have no clear idea on how much an in lab would be. BMI was around normal range. Within this timeframe, I saw a second pulmonologist and it was basically the same story, in lab recommendations with no clear pricing. I gave up. 

Currently: Snoring has increased to the point it is bothering my partner at night. BMI has increased by 20 pounds. I am working to loose the weight. I take Doxepin to fall asleep.

During the day, I stop breating too, especially when I'm thinking hard or having short bursts of effort (ex: taking stairs). It's like breathing for me isn't a reflex, it's a thought action.

I've tried putting my CPAP while doing other tasks (relaxing in bed) and notices that I had relief because I didn't have to think about breathing anymore. Also my CPAP machine noticed during those times that I'd stop breathing too.

All the documentation on the ResMed talks about how much better the algorithm is — but the first night I tried to use it, I had to go back to the Philips. 

The sensation that I’m used to with the Philips is one where, as I start to breathe in, the machine will instantly ‘snap’ the airflow into place. No matter how quickly I inhale, the peak of the machine’s breath will sync perfectly with mine, pop. 

The ResMed is bizarrely sluggish — the peak of the machine’s breath feels way behind mine, with a very long tail. This was making it absolutely impossible for me to stop thinking about my breathing and breathe naturally— as I say, I ended up taking it off in frustration. 

Welp. This is mildly terrifying. It doesn’t help that I’m in the midst of a period of severe health anxiety and insomnia — but how the heck do I get used to this new sensation? Is there a way to make the ResMed snappier, or anything else you can suggest?

1pwm6y1,DISE and MAD and Inspire,"I completed a DISE (Drug Induced Sleep Endoscopy) a few days ago. 

For background, (F 69yo) I've been using PAP therapy for more than a year. Had 3 in-lab sleep studies; at one point worked with a sleep diagnostic specialist; have 2 machines (CPAP and Bi-level); have tried 12 masks and am using a non-vented mask set-up for high loop gain and cyclical breathing; lost 40 lbs on a GLP-1 so have normal BMI; sleep only on my side with a soft cervical collar and mouth tape; no mask leaks; graduated CBT-i so have good sleep habits; am controlling RLS with opioids. I am seen regularly by Neurologists at 2 major hospitals in the Boston area. I feel like I have maximized PAP therapy, and my AHI has dropped from 67 to usually under 2, all Central Events. 

However, I feel like something is still not working. It's difficult to sleep more than 90 minutes at a time without waking up. Sleep is not refreshing. I rarely have any REM sleep. OSCAR data shows dozens of PLMs and jagged breathing patterns.

So my ENT suggested DISE for diagnostic purposes.

The DISE VOTE results showed V Grade 2 (complete anterior-posterior collapse); O Grade 1 (partial anterior-posterior collapse); T Grade 1 (partial anterior-posterior collapse); E Grade 2 (complete anterior-posterior collapse). Conclusion:  I am an excellent candidate for oral appliance therapy (MAD) or hypoglossal nerve stimulator (Inspire). CPAP may or may not be making everything worse.

My question: Has anyone had a long-term positive experience with either MAD or Inspire, especially to fix total velum and epiglottis collapse? (I'm only interested in experiences with MAD devices supplied by professional dentists like Diplomats of the American Board of Dental Sleep Medicine.) After so many different attempts to address my sleep issues, I'm tired and skeptical. Hoping there are some positive experiences out there for either one of these devices. Otherwise, I'm probably looking at surgical interventions like hyoid suspension. TIA",1766802376.0,6,12,SleepApnea,sleep

Longtime off/on problems with sleep (took lunesta for a while during perimeno); still have rx for low dose of xanax (0.25 mg) which I typically split and might take a couple nights a week. A 30-tablet bottle lasts me at least 6 months.

other background: caregiver to spouse w/quite advanced parkinsons, and i'm still working part time. I think my cortisol level stays cranked pretty high nearly all the time; it is a situation where one is constantly on call and the stakes of a screwup can be high. We sleep in separate rooms and he does not usually wake me, maybe once very three or four nights when he needs help. It's not that bad, but after that .... I don't go back to sleep, generally.

BMI is a bit over 28 so not a candidate for zepbound. I do try to fast-walk on the treadmill 30 to 45 minutes almost daily.

Got a CPAP a bit over a month ago, and I""m trying hard to be compliant (im hitting the insurance usage target okay) but have tried 4 different masks, lots of pressure adjustments (using OSCAR), mouth taping, chin strap ... and trying to sleep remains miserable nearly every night. Lots of nights with only 4 hours of sleep such as it is, due to mask-leak arousals and monkey mind and dry mouth and ... eh, I dunno. It's bad. I can fall asleep but I don't stay there.

I know all the general sleep hygiene stuff but i'm pretty desperate to get some shuteye that is decent, not chopped into two-hour increments with 90 minutes of wake time in between. there's been some research in the sleep-rx world since I last took any of that stuff.

1pweg76,Wanted to see what other's timelimes were like,"Preface: When I was very young, say 4-8 I was a very sick kid. Pneumonia, fever of 104, the cold and flu hit very hard, but after that I guess my immune system decided to start working smd I very rarely got sick from age 10 on. Every now and then I'd get a cold that would take me down for a day, but then it would be over. I also have year-round hayfever, so when we lived on the east coast I was always stuffed up, could never breathe through my nose properly, and developed into mouth breathing. When we moved back to the west coast, my nose issues improved significantly, but I never used Flonase since it didn't feel like it helped (no doctor ever explained that it wouldn't immediately help and get better so I thought it didn't work for me). I kind of developed the mindset that I just had to push through things, they weren't really that serious when it came to my health. In 2017, a friend that was in school for nursing talked to me after I stayed at their place for the night and said my snoring was abysmally loud and I should get checked for OSA. I checked it off as I have snored since I can remember and I'd be fine. My weight gain started around then, but with a bit of exercise and diet modification I was able almost able to control it so I put it off as being 26 and my metabolism finally slowing down. Cut to the beginning of 2020, even with sleeping 7-9 hours a night I would fall asleep at my desk at work while typing, so I went to my doctor and started Flonase (properly explained to me and it has worked amazingly) and they recommended a sleep study. Obviously, it wasn't done that year and I just forgot about it. It took my sister noticing I stopped breathing when I would fall asleep, timing it, and saying it wasn't normal and 55 seconds was bad.

To present: I went to my doctor last June, got a referral for sleep study consult this past November, got my at home sleep study test on the 15th and got the data this past Monday. I'm at 99 events per hour, spO2 under 88% for 70% of my 6 hours on the test with 51% being the lowest reading, BMI at 30.3. They called and scheduled me for the earliest available titration test (1/5), so that is coming soon. Given the severity, what are opinions on how soon I'll be setup on on a CPAP (or bipap, the person I spoke with said my results may have me go this route). 

I also have a referall to an ENT so they can check my nose and sinuses to see if there is anything blocking the airflow. NP said from the quick check it looks good, but I should be getting better airflow and being able to get back to nose breathing should have been easier for me. Along with scoping it all, I'm told they're going to do a comprehensive allergy panel to see if there are other factors involved as well.

Here’s my situation: My wife says I snore a lot—like, the walls practically shake. She also says that sometimes (not always) I stop breathing for a bit and then start again, and she even has to nudge or elbow me awake sometimes. The weird thing is, I actually sleep through the whole night without waking up at all. I don’t respond to noise or anything; my wife literally has to really shake me to get me up.

Still, I wake up extremely tired every morning—just really, really exhausted—and I can fall asleep anytime during the day if I just close my eyes, afternoon or evening.

On top of that, I have inflamed nasal turbinates and have basically breathed through my mouth since I was a kid. The ENT didn’t recommend surgery because the issue might just come back due to allergies. So every morning I wake up with a dry mouth and a bunch of dried mucus, sometimes coughing up these dry bits from my throat. Other times, though, I find my pillow soaked in drool. It’s all kind of inconsistent.

Meanwhile, my Apple Watch shows I have decent deep sleep—about 15-20%, and also same REM each night—and it doesn’t show any red flags for breathing interruptions. So I’m worried that maybe I don’t have apnea and it’s something else, and I have no idea what that could be.

My question is: could I still have sleep apnea despite the Apple Watch saying everything looks normal? Has anyone else had a similar experience? I’d really appreciate any insight!

Going to chat with my husband about other conditions that might be at play. He’s sleeping in the basement while we wait for a better hose, hose hanger and wedge pillow (maybe a night camera too). We’re still determined to sleep in the same bed, but not if it means sleep deprivation and anxiety. 

Original post here: 


Sleep apnea is a life changing and terrible condition and I’m so sorry for anyone who has to suffer with it. 

Raw thoughts (Been a hard night. Machine malfunctions and Xmas alcohol/ food):


Sleep apnea is an extreme of a condition as depression. Life altering to the person who has it and their household. 

My partner rarely remembers any interactions during the night… but I do. And it’s so isolating. 

It’s like talking to your spouse while they’re playing on their phone and didn’t hear anything you said…
Except multiple times a night while you’re trying to get the bare minimum amount of sleep before the kids wake up. 


I hate it. It’s so hard and isolating to live with.

It’s a constant topic in our couples therapy and life (3-5 times a week we have really hard nights). 

We have two small kids and a small house. I don’t trust him asleep and to be safe/ responsive to the kids (physical reactions to being woken up can be violent… but mostly just cruel) but he won’t sleep in the finished basement or on the couch. 

So neither of us sleep. And the sleep deprivation makes me feel like I’m going crazy.  

12 years together and now, the scariest part isn’t what he’ll do/say in the night … it’s  the anticipation of it happening. My anxiety before bed is strong. I feel like I stay up listening to hear if his machine is going to work and if it’s going to be a good or bad night, instead of going to sleep asap to get extra rest. 

I’m tired.

HOWEVER… last few years I keep waking up every hour or two, most nights

not for bathroom needs, room is dark, no noises, no bed motion, cool temps (have tried 62-68 degrees), full stomach or empty, alcohol or not, melatonin, benadryl, have no painful positions or body parts, so rolling over isn’t causing it, have tried numerous types and heights of pillows, light and heavy blankets, different mattresses, soft music, “sleep sounds” or quiet….none of it seems to matter.   I’m comfortable in bed, not in pain in any way.

I fall asleep fine… but I almost always wake up 4-5 times a night and then fall back asleep quickly

Anyone else experienced this and found a solution?     I’m at my wits end…. I know it’s preventing me from being fully rested when I get up to start the day.

1pvb4hs,Sleep walking + Night terrors,"Happy Christmas!

38 / M / 176 pounds (I’ve put on a few pounds recently and could be fitter)

I was recently diagnosed with severe sleep apnea (around 30 events per hour). I never felt tired during the day, but I would sit up screaming during the night and sometimes rush out of bed after a bad nightmare. I eventually got checked by doctor when I started injuring myself during these panic episodes - at one point I even smashed a window, which obviously became too dangerous. A few months later, I also broke my little finger in an episode.

Since October I’ve been using a CPAP machine, and my events are now down to under 5 per hour, which is within the normal range. Because of that, I felt confident that wearing the mask would prevent any major incidents.

However, last night I had my first episode since starting CPAP. I woke from a nightmare, ripped the mask off, and was screaming while trying to turn the light on. Thankfully I didn’t injure myself, but it’s left me feeling worried that I could still hurt myself. I suspect overtiredness might be a trigger, but I’m not certain. I’m worried with a second child on the way I’m going to injure someone else.

I was wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar - sleepwalking or night terrors alongside CPAP - and whether anyone has any advice or insight.

Thanks in advance. ",1766660630.0,7,3,SleepApnea,sleep
1pvajl6,A Prototype to Track Sleep Position,"I used to track my sleep position with a camera to better understand my snoring patterns and sleep quality, as I noticed a correlation between them. However, it was too troublesome to do this every night. I also tried using SomnoPose for several days, but I didn’t like wearing my phone while sleeping.

As a sensor engineer, I realized I could create a more comfortable solution. That’s how I came up with the idea of a pillow embedded with sensors to monitor sleep positions. Since I’ve seen many people interested in tracking their sleep posture, I’d like to share my project and invite discussion about its features, limitations, and potential improvements. My goal is to gather feedback to see if this concept is worth refining further.

It wasn’t until today that I realized untreated sleep apnea might be a factor in causing or worsening NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) which I have been diagnosed with. 

I’ve been wondering if the combination of NAFLD and my pulmonary hypertension could be impacting my O2 levels. During the day, my O2 is typically in the low 90s. It is never above 95%.

I’ve scheduled an appointment with my gastroenterologist to get his take on this. I’m curious if anyone else has experienced NAFLD as a result of untreated sleep apnea.

I am worried about how men will react to learning about this when dating and if I’ll get rejected for this reason. I am visiting my family for the holidays now and just said something about how I’m excited to start finally treating it, and my mom and sister replied that they think cpaps are really gross and creepy.

I've been treated with CPAP for 1.5 years now. Pressure is between 4.5 and 6 tops, EPR level 1.
With this I usually reached between 2-3 AHI/h at most, 0 OSA.


Lately (last 3 months) it started climbing up to 10-15, all CSA/hypopnea. I'm also having mild chest pain (diaphragm) in the morning. 


Looking at the machine at night then through OSCAR, it appears that I have a good night sleep usually up to 3-5 in the morning then having a increase of CSA (like 15 to 30 AHI/h for the 2 remaining hours before getting up). No diaphragm pain prior to the ""burst"", but always afterwards.


The only change I could think of is starting breathing physiotherapy.

I told her that 1. she's likely thrashing around because her brain is being constantly starved of oxygen so the CPAP should probably stop that from happening, B. I'm pretty certain that with the way the tubes work, it would be pretty hard to get it wrapped around her neck, and C. she's already essentially ""choking"" in her sleep anyways from the disorder. 

At the moment, Inspire wouldn't be covered by her insurance because she has to try and fail at least a CPAP.

Doctors will fob you off. Insurance will say you are healthy. But the truth of the matter is, your machine's ""compliance"" won't do squat to get you the adequate treatment you need.

It is my educated opinion that most, if not all patients suffering from sleep disordered breathing would do better on more advanced machines. The great and leading sleep scientist Barry Krakow recommends bilevel and ASV machines to treat flow limitations. CPAP and APAP just doesn't cut it for sleep apnea and UARS.

Putting nearly 15 years of constant, slowly worsening suffering into words.

I’m 28. When I was 13, I started having weird throat problems all the time. It felt like my throat had a lot of pressure in it, like a tense feeling, and the only thing that helped was when I drank or ate something or swallowed. This would help then it would come back a bit later. Sometimes a couple minutes later sometimes an hour later. But it always came back quickly. I had weird issues swallowing saliva too. I saw an ear nose & throat doctor and was told my issue was acid reflux. I was prescribed reflux medication and told to sleep on an incline. I did those things, but it didn’t help. Supposedly I was treating the issue and the doctor didn’t know why I wasn’t improving but told me to continue doing what I was doing to supposedly treat it. I saw some other doctors that weren’t sure either. I remember one doctor told me that the throat issues were perhaps mental and not actually real, especially since treatment wasn’t helping. I learned to just live with it but it was annoying and took over my life to the point that all day every day revolved around coping with my throat. I had bad anxiety because of it, used to avoid things, had to make sure I always had something to drink to help my throat, and felt so stressed about it all and how it was affecting me. My body also physically felt stressed out and anxious all the time. My day to day life was miserable. I knew something was wrong but didn’t know what. I went from being a really happy kid prior to this to being a completely different person in a short amount of time. I became more withdrawn. I had no social life cause I was so consumed with what was happening to me.

About a year or so later, when I was 14, I started to feel a brain fog on top of the throat and bad anxiety issues. It was like I felt like crap all the time. Like the feeling when you sleep bad for a couple nights and you feel bad, except I was sleeping plenty. I felt kind of spaced out, couldn’t concentrate as well, never wanted to do anything, and just felt kind of crappy all the time. Cognitively I wasn’t as sharp and I felt like crap. Not sleepy, but tired. There’s a difference. Wasn’t severe yet but was definitely impacting my day to day life, in addition to the throat stuff and feeling anxious and stressed all the time. I went back to seeing doctors. Multiple doctors said there was nothing wrong with me and some even said that the brain fog and throat issues were all mental. I didn’t feel like that was it because it felt so real and physical but what did I know at 14. I was prescribed antidepressants and doctors recommended I see a therapist for anxiety issues. I spent the next couple of years trying medications, seeing therapists, I made lifestyle changes but nothing helped. I thought I was going crazy. Therapists made me feel even worse as they further pushed the doctors belief that all my issues were mental. In those few years that passed, I had slowly started to feel worse. It wasn't a day to day difference but a few months would pass and the brain fog and cognitive issues were worse than they were just a few months earlier. I had no quality of life.

By the time I graduated high school, the constant brain fog and tired feeling had worsened and was affecting me pretty bad. I felt stressed and anxious nonstop, both because of how much these issues were affecting my life and I physically felt anxious all the time too. Sometimes the anxiety was so bad I would literally start sweating. Throat still annoying the hell out of me. I had almost no social life during high school because these issues and coping with symptoms consumed my life. Literally consumed my existence. I did just the minimum to get by. My mindset every day was just to get through the day best I could. Believe it or not, I managed to play high school tennis feeling like absolute dog shit 24/7. Told myself constantly to snap out of it. I so desperately wanted to have a life and have fun. Multiple doctors told me there was nothing physically wrong with me. I started to believe them about it being all mental. Why wouldn't I believe multiple doctors? I thought it was something I was doing wrong personally. At this point I wasn’t even talking to my family about it as much since supposedly there was nothing wrong and it was all in my head and whenever I did bring it up they gave me crap for it like it was all mental and I just needed to snap out of it. They heard the same things from doctors that there was nothing wrong with me, so I don't totally blame them for having this attitude. I felt guilty even saying anything about it anymore. It felt like it was a personal failure for feeling the way I did. I had the impression that my issues were because of me and I just needed to change my mindset and lifestyle and I’d feel better. I needed to change my thinking, my behavior, take antidepressants, do my anxiety workbooks and go to therapy. I did every single thing doctors and therapists and family told me to do but nothing helped. I questioned my sanity every day.

I was in no shape to go to college, but I did. I ended up going because according to everyone there was nothing wrong with me and I was trying desperately to believe that and be normal. So I pushed myself to go, hoping I’d sort it out soon. I didn't. I spent the next 4 years slowly feeling worse, still seeing doctors but getting no real answers. I'd go months and months at a time without even seeing a doctor as I didn't know where to turn and had given up at times. I spent most my time laying down. I'd also go back to thinking maybe it's all in my head, but at the same time my symptoms felt so real and more severe than anything mental could cause. Add to that no mental health treatments ever helped. First year of college I saw a doctor about sleep apnea, something I at the time knew nothing about. He examined me and did scans and didn't see anything abnormal and told me sleep apnea most likely wasn't my problem. I also wasn't overweight, which is one of the main causes of sleep apnea. Still, I tried one of those cheap mouthpieces that’s supposed to help with sleep apnea but didn't see any benefit from it. So with all of this in mind, I figured it’s probably not sleep apnea so moved on and forgot about it. I was so desperate for answers, I was constantly trying all sorts of medications, drugs, supplements, and other weird things to try and help myself. I bought bizarre supplements and herbs from overseas, saw alternative medicine doctors. I felt like I was losing my goddamn mind. My mental health was awful. Felt like crap 24/7. I literally felt stupid because my brain wasn’t working and felt so mushy. Dealing with symptoms and figuring out what was wrong with me consumed my entire life. For school, I would occasionally go to class after taking a heavy dose of stimulant drugs, but even those only did so much. It got to the point that no amount of pills, energy drinks did anything either.

I experienced nothing enjoyable in 4 years of college. I had no life, really no friends, relationships, hobbies, nothing. So pretty much like high school but the symptoms were even more severe. My days consisted of me sometimes going to class and then spending the rest of the day and night laying down cause I felt like shit 24/7. Literally the only experience I had in college was when I went on a study abroad trip but it was terrible because I felt so awful the whole time. I had also joined a fraternity in the beginning of college but did almost nothing with them because of my health. The mental fog and cognitive deficit had gotten so bad it felt like I was disconnected and living in a dream. Like I felt kind of drunk. I was so mentally and emotionally numb and exhausted I didn’t even feel human. Like I physically could not feel emotions and felt super spaced out. I was also still dealing with the throat issues. I’d get random dizziness, my vision got worse, I was more sensitive to light, had almost no sex drive. My body also physically started feeling numb. Like my body and mind were detached from each other. I'm sure everyone that knew me thought I was just some low energy quiet person, when I'm actually not at all. In four years, I also spent thousands of dollars on medical related stuff. Shuttles and ubers to and from appointments (I didn't have a car at the time and lived almost 2 hours from the major city), saw private care doctors, tried supplements, drugs, etc. I somehow managed to graduate college and finished feeling way worse than when I began. And it sucked because I desperately wanted to have a life and feel human but my body didn’t allow me to. But I was at least glad college was over cause it was horrible.

I spent the next year after college doing the minimum to get by and just get through each day, feeling horrible nonstop. Still having no life because of my issues. Still being told by doctors that they didn't know what was wrong with me or that nothing at all was wrong with me. I still didn’t know what was wrong with me either. About a year after college (2019), I had a sleep study done and it came back with sleep apnea. For the first time I actually had an answer. Sleep doctor prescribed a CPAP machine. I spent about a year messing with the machine and the face mask they gave me and got no benefit. I then switched to a different machine and tried other masks. Still not much improvement. It was also really difficult to keep it on and sleep through the night with it. I'd also wake up a bunch during the night, rip it off without knowing, etc. But I was desperately trying to make it work. During this time I couldn’t really hold down a job, other than some really basic, short term jobs. And even those felt brutal. I got fired from a couple jobs because I was so nonfunctional and it showed, despite me trying my best. I was a complete zombie because the tiredness was so overwhelming. It was as an amount of brain fog and exhaustion I didn’t know was humanly possible and would be completely unimaginable to most people. I was making myself sick every day with stimulants. I was taking stuff like Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, modafinil. I was so tired none were really helping and even had a doctor at one point tell me that I should get genetic testing for depression or have my brain zapped with electric shocks. I didn't go that route. By this point, I'd had nearly every medical test someone could have done. CT scans of my brain, food allergy testing, testing for toxic mold in my body, every possible vitamin and mineral test, blood tests, etc.

After 2 years of messing with different CPAP machines and masks and settings and still struggling, my sleep doctor then recommended I see a maxillofacial doctor, which deals with the anatomy of the face, to see what the underlying breathing issue was being caused by. The doctor recommended I get a custom oral device made that shifts the lower jaw forward to help open the airway to prevent breathing issues while sleeping. The process of having it fitted and made took a couple months. I even took a “real” career type job during this same time because I had two different doctors telling me that this mouthpiece was likely to help me a lot. I felt like I couldn’t have gotten the mouthpiece fast enough. I ended up messing with the mouthpiece for months and had no benefit at all. Literally zero. The dentist who made the mouthpiece said that the mouthpiece wasn’t helping because I might just have “weak muscle tone” in my throat and that I should see someone called a myofunctional doctor to supposedly improve muscle tone in the throat and tongue. I looked into that and it seemed like total quack stuff so I didn’t do it and completely dropped that dentist that made my mouthpiece and suggested this. I then saw an ear nose and throat doctor and later did a sleep endoscopy with him where I was put to sleep and had my breathing monitored with a camera down my throat. The doctor said that my breathing issues were being caused by my throat and jaw and suggested that since the mouthpiece wasn’t helping, I could get surgery or have a device called Inspire surgically inserted into my chest and neck to artificially help breathing. I held off on that cause it sounded pretty extreme and thought there had to be something else. During this time I got fired from the job I should’ve never taken in the first place because I was so non-functional and called out all the time

I pretty much gave up for months. I eventually scheduled an appointment with another ear nose & throat doctor (the same kind of doctor I first saw when I was 13). I'd already seen multiple ear nose & throat doctors by this point but didn't know what else to do. Some breathing tests showed that hardly any air was getting through my nose when I breathed in. I had a really severe form of something called nasal valve collapse, which was causing both sides of my nose to almost completely cave in and block most air when breathing in, even when just breathing in a little bit. This issue is worse during sleep as breathing is deeper during sleep, which was causing more of a collapse. The body naturally tries to breathe through the nose during sleep so all night I was struggling to breathe and then mouth breathing which isn't good for sleep quality and was slowly feeling worse over time as I was never getting quality sleep. So the bad sleep every night just kept accumulating over the course of nearly 15 years. He also explained that the nose and throat are so intrinsically connected and that my throat issues were a sign that my nose wasn’t functioning normally, which was causing airflow issues and a throat pressure feeling as a result. Normal airflow through the nose down the throat doesn't cause throat issues. Nothing specific caused this issue to happen. Just the way my face and nose naturally developed over time. My doctor said this is not a common issue and when it does happen is typically the result of an injury or prior surgery as opposed to it just happening naturally. A little bit of collapse can be harmless but said mine was one of the worst he'd seen naturally occur.

When I was 27, I had nasal reconstructive surgery and a septoplasty surgery. It took a long time to recover from the surgery. Probably 6 months of nose pain. My sleep was still horrible after surgery. It's like the trauma of living in that state for so long finally got to the point that my brain was rewired to be in constant stress mode. I'd say this got a lot worse about 6 months before I had surgery. No matter how hard I tried to relax, I couldn't and it was greatly affecting my sleep. About 2 additional years of living like this before I finally found medication and other things that helped reset me. That was horrible.

Over time most of my issues have gone away since it was the crap sleep that was giving me most my symptoms. The slowly worsening constant brain fog, shit tired feeling and cognitive issues that started when I was a young teenager. The severe anxiety/depression/stress feelings I had since I was a kid. (Actually the anxiety issues went away a couple years before this. I think the tiredness got so bad that it eventually overpowered the anxiety feeling). Sleep apnea, bad sleep and horrible breathing issues stresses the hell out of the body and caused me to feel anxious and stressed out all the time. Constant fight or flight hyper stressed mode. The severe derealization/depersonalization symptoms caused by sleep deprivation. My body no longer feels numb and detached from my brain. The throat issues are totally gone. I can feel emotions again. I don't feel like killing myself out of misery anymore. It was that simple but untreated made my life constant fucking torture to no end. Feeling horrible nonstop, slowly getting worse over the course of more than a decade, not knowing why, being told there was nothing wrong with me AND that it was maybe all psychological was a mental hell I wouldn't wish on anyone. I don’t feel like my teenage years and most my 20s actually happened because I was in such bad health physically and mentally and in a complete fog of exhaustion 24/7. Like I felt like I was detached from reality living in a dream cause the brain fog was so severe. Living like this was very isolating. I spent most my time alone cause I couldn't function and being around people feeling the way I was was incredibly stressful and draining. And even when I did do things, they were miserable cause I was in such a fog. Every day was about just getting through the day. I missed out on most ""normal"" things other people I knew were doing. Things like going out and doing things and having fun, dating, having close friends, hobbies, goals, lots of missed income, opportunities, thousands of dollars spent on medical bullshit. On and on.

I wish I had been able to see good doctors earlier, but that didn’t happen for some reason. What if that ENT doctor I saw when I was 13 had done his job correctly and diagnosed me? How would my life have been? Cause it sure wouldn't have been as god awful as it was. It's also frustrating knowing that I wasn't able to figure this out myself. I think I was just so used to really bad breathing since I was young that I didn’t know it wasn't normal and didn't know any different and didn't ever think to look at myself breathing in a mirror. I wasn't aware of ""nasal valve collapse"". No doctor ever told me anything either and it never crossed my mind I could have some weird abnormal issue. I assumed everyone breathed like that. Assumed everyone woke up with a really sore throat. It's frustrating knowing that all of this suffering was so preventable. These issues consumed and ruined every aspect of my life 24/7 for nearly 15 years. My life outside of this was complete nothing. I mean literally nothing. Trying to explain what I went through to someone that can't comprehend or relate to it one bit is tough. I'm doing much better now, but thinking about how much time I lost is really sad. It’s like a massive chunk of my life was taken from me. I wasn’t able to develop in a normal healthy way as a teenager/young adult. I’m nearly 30 and a good chunk of my life feels like it didn’t even happen. I feel like I’m 15. Years flew by in a fog of exhaustion and don’t feel real. Like they were a dream. I've learned there is NOTHING more important in life than proper breathing and sleep. Very basic natural things most people will fortunately never have to think about. I’m proud of myself for persevering for as a long as I did. I think many people would’ve killed themselves a long time ago if they went through this. Maybe my story can help someone out there or prevent someone’s kid from needlessly suffering like I did for nearly 15 years.

Here's a video I took of my breathing last year to show you what I'm talking about.

I'm 31M, good BMI but was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea this year (AHI 48).  
After DISE, I ended up getting Septoplasty, Tonsillectomy and UPPP in May 2025.  
  
My snoring/choking has reduced since then and I feel better.  
However, I still snore (not loud) if I sleep on my back.   
  
I use 'SnoreLab app' to track my snoring and after consulting with my surgeon, he said I'll have to wear a chin strap to train my mind to keep my mouth shut during sleep.  
  
Apparently since I was working on only one functional nostril, my body used to keep my mouth open during sleep to ensure I got enough oxygen.  
  
Now I need to unlearn it.  
But I'm unable to find any good chin straps in the market.  
The surgeon said there's no one chin strap fits all product and I'd have to try and see what works for me.  
  
Do you guys have any recommendations?  
Any other method/product that worked for you? I was asked to sleep on the side but I can only do that on the couch or I'd end up on my back in my sleep.

The only thing is, if I put it on those settings, the distilled water in the humidifier tank dissipates within like five or less hours, leaving me awake and with a horribly dry throat not too long after that. I found that turning down the heat two notches is okayish for me in terms of the dry throat and being able to sleep a little longer, but the water still runs out too fast and I end up waking with a dry throat.

I started running a humidifier last night, and it barely helped. I woke up early with a slightly dry throat and quite early again. I went out and got a cheap hygrometer (humidity reader) and found out that the room I'm sleeping in is at like 49% humidity as of now, which is in a normal range.

I (21m) have been dealing with symptoms including: never waking up feeling refreshed, always extremely tired, brain fog, cold hands/feet constantly, poor libido and ED, GI issues despite eating very healthy, waking up to pee often, and being an extremely light sleeper. I also have some trouble breathing through my nose during the day. I also am DX'ed w/ anxiety, depression, and ADHD. These symptoms are becoming unbearable.

FWIW I also have elevated hemoglobin, hemocrit, and RBC. Other bloodwork markers are normal.

Symptoms have been ongoing for <8 years and no amount of Vyvanse or caffeine wakes me up during the day.

I took a WatchPat ONE test, and it said no sleep apnea, but I had an overall RDI value of 7.8; [https://imgur.com/a/an5OFys](https://imgur.com/a/an5OFys) . I am hopefully getting a PSG done in the coming months.

I just recently saw an ENT, and he told me I had a deviated septum and instructed me to use Flonase and nasal strips and to come back for nasal surgery if it doesn't resolve in a few months.

I’m feeling a bit stuck on what some productive next steps are. My ENT didn’t seem overly concerned beyond nasal sprays, but given my symptoms and elevated RDI, I’m wondering:

\- Does anyone know of a doctor near Philadelphia or Pittsburgh who will take my symptoms/RDI seriously?

\- Has anyone here had a WatchPAT that looked “normal” on AHI but later showed UARS or flow limitation on an in-lab PSG?

\- What should I make sure the PSG includes?

\- For those with deviated septum / nasal obstruction, did medical therapy help, or did surgery meaningfully improve sleep quality?

\- Would it be worth seeing a sleep specialist who specifically treats UARS rather than waiting for ENT follow-up alone?

1pu0b9j,"Doctor says my 12.1 RDI ""means nothing"" (because AHI is 1.6). She prescribed antidepressants. Thoughts?","Hey everyone,

I’m a 24M who has, for quite a long time, felt like shit: chronic fatigue and brain fog, waking up at night (though I fall back asleep quickly), waking up with light headaches, dry mouth, congested nose, …

I thought it might be sleep apnea so I went to a private neurophysiologist specialized in sleep medicine.

She suggested a home sleep test, so I did the Watchpat ONE, and these are the results:

* pAHI: 1.6
* pRDI: 12.1 Global (81 total events).
* REM pRDI: 15.7.
* Heart Rate:  Min 35 BPM / Avg 49 BPM / Max 85 BPM (peaked 4 times to 81-85 BPM).
* Oxygen: Nadir 93%.
* Sleep Stages: 55,8% Light Sleep / 19.5% Deep Sleep / 24.6 REM

The doctor told me everything is ""perfectly normal"" and gave me generic advice like ""have a light dinner."" When I specifically asked what that 12.1 pRDI meant, she told me that It means nothing and that results were normal and correct.

She then prescribed me Mirtazapine (an antidepressant) to see if my quality of sleep improves, with a follow-up in one month.

Does a 12.1 RDI really mean nothing? Maybe she is right and my symptoms are caused by some other issues like hypothyroidism? (which I also have, a mild case) 

Is starting to take antidepressants really a good move, especially since it’s only based on a 15 minute visit and a home test? Im afraid to develop a dependency on something I don't actually need. Tbh the idea of taking antidepressants kind of freaks me out.

Also note that I am not in the strongest financial position right now so I can’t afford to cycle through dozens of doctors and tests.

Should I seek a second opinion despite the cost, or just try the meds?

1ptqxsz,"Doc says Central Apneas <5 AHI are NOT a problem, and ASV is ""dangerous""","TL;DR - got my hands on an ASV (set to CPAP mode(?) so I changed it to AutoASV) which reduced my AHI to near-zero. Doctor from the CPAP store (not my actual Somnologist) rang me furious that I changed it myself, citing dangers to my heart and that they wouldn't sanction me using ASV treatment (I'm getting private treatment btw). They also stated that an AHI below 5 is normal, regardless of apnea type. 



Hello all, I have been on a decade-long journey of finally getting a diagnosis, using CPAP/APAP/Bi-level at various points (all which completely resolved OSA but induced CA/HA and I've never felt rested from using any of them) and being denied the chance to try ASV at every turn (usual script about how deathly-dangerous it is, even though I've had a recent heart USG/ECG which is completely clear).

I've recently started with my 4th Sleep clinic (moved around EU a lot in the past 10 years), and had to explain the Treatment-Emergent CSA situation once again. Doc is quite responsive to my questions and was happy to look at my OSCAR screenshots showing the OSA>CPAP>CSA pipeline (did a PSG which showed 85AHI for OSA and maybe 2AHI of CAs/HAs). They put me in touch with a CPAP store (with their own doctor) who rented me a Bi-level machine, titrated it to report back to them. 

The machine crushed my OAs to basically 0, but showed CAs/HAs between 3-7 AHI. Returned it and asked about ASV (expecting the usual spiel) but the person in store said they'd rent me one for 4 nights over the weekend. Got it home, noticed it was set to CPAP mode so changed it myself to ASVAuto. Had 2 nights of AHI \~0.28 (which equates to 2 singular episodes PER NIGHT). Didn't feel much different, but definitely felt more comfortable using ASV (which helped a lot with my nasal breathing) and I'm also aware that it can take weeks to show results in how rested you feel.

Doctor from the store rang me last night, pretty raging that I'd changed the machine myself (although they were more emphatic than angry, but very direct with me). They said:

\- ASV is dangerous (I'm sure you know the gyst) and that they wouldn't treat me going forward if I decided to get one myself and use it (despite Resmed themselves narrowing the contraindication group to people with Heart Failure and a low Ejection Fraction)

\- Any AHI below 5 is normal (regardless of type, LOL)

\- I don't have CSA, citing the PSG and titration results. This is incorrect because the titration from the Bi-level in OSCAR showed CSAs as the highest apnea type (they corrected themselves when I told them I had the charts in front of me showing as such, but still insisted they weren't important)

\- I should look elsewhere for the symptoms of my tiredness. L.M.A.O - I've done every Diet, bedtime, exercise, Thyroid panel, blood test, USG, EEG, MRI, fasting Glucose, Continuous Glucose, H.Pylori, Candida, Mono etc test imaginable 

I'm scheduling another appointment with my actual Somnologist/Pulmonologist and I want to go in prepared, can anybody chime in with relevant information that either confirms or denies their outlook? Happy to post OSCAR screens if it helps, thanks for reading

I had a sleep study done about two years ago because of severe fatigue that came back normal. They tried a sleep medication but it didn't work and I never went back to it. Since then I've gained significant weight due to medication issues, and the fatigue from my chronic health issues making me unable to exercise.

My parents had told me I snore loudly (we share a wall) and then my girlfriend and I spent the night together recently and she told me that I'm stopping breathing in my sleep too. Sleep apnea runs in my family too. I have an appointment with my doctor in a few weeks to be evaluated, but in the meantime...

1.  Has anyone successfully been given treatment to help with the fatigue being amplified by sleep apnea while they try to lose weight?

2. Does anyone else experience a feeling of falling in the middle of the night and then jerk awake? It's not a hypnic jerk I don't think because I'm in REM sleep when it happens. I'm not waking up gasping or anything either so I'm trying to figure out if it's sleep apnea related or not.

1ptlcmc,CPAP forever or painful surgery? 35 and feeling hopeless,"35M here. I’ve got pretty brutal obstructive sleep apnea.. My in lab sleep study in 2023 showed an AHI of 61, all obstructive. I’m not overweight. My is BMI about 25–26 (170 cm, 75 kg). I’ve been on a ResMed AirSense 11 for about a year on and off and my OSCAR charts usually show AHI between 0 and 2, so CPAP is clearly doing its job, but mentally I’m struggling with the idea of being tied to this machine forever. Keep in mind I don’t feel any more rested with the CPAP vs Without. I wake up with blocked nose, crusty/dry mouth and just horrible feeling. 

I saw a sleep‑surgeon ENT today. She said I have a mildly deviated septum, enlarged inferior turbinates and some nasal obstruction. When I take a deep breath, one nostril actually collapses from the outside (nasal valve issue). She said she could do septoplasty + inferior turbinate reduction, but the valve collapse might need a different surgeon. She was honest that nasal surgery probably wouldn’t “cure” my apnea but could help with congestion and CPAP comfort. As a test, she told me to try Breathe Right strips and Dristan nasal spray with my CPAP for a few nights to see if opening my nose makes mornings less stuffy and maybe reduces mouth leaks.

For my throat, she said my tongue is a bit too big for my mouth. She mentioned she could do expansion sphincter pharyngoplasty plus lingual tonsillectomy with coblation (so palate + tongue‑base work), but warned it’s basically 10/10 pain for about three weeks and there’s no guarantee it would get me off CPAP. Given that my CPAP numbers are so good, she actually doesn’t recommend this surgery for me right now and feels CPAP is a better, more predictable option.

Emotionally, I’m having a hard time accepting CPAP for life. I’m only 35. Traveling with the machine is annoying, and I hate the idea of looking like a 90‑year‑old on an oxygen rig if I’m dating and someone stays over. I travel a lot too and I cannot afford a travel CPAP and have no private insurance. At the same time, the idea of going through a really painful throat surgery that might not even let me ditch CPAP is pretty terrifying.

For anyone here with severe OSA but good CPAP control, did you go ahead with throat surgery (ESP, tongue‑base, lingual tonsils, etc.) and actually manage to get off CPAP? Was it worth it? And for people who’ve had nasal surgery (septoplasty/turbinates/valve), did it meaningfully help your CPAP comfort, mouth leaks, or congestion, or even your AHI?

1ptjl41,Intake Nasal Strip Experience,"I searched the sub and didn’t find many recent posts about the Intake nasal strip  product, so I thought I would share my honest opinion from my experience.

First off, they work for me. My sleep at night is noticeably longer and more restful by at least 10% or more, I would estimate. That’s a massive difference for me, but I have a few things I wish were different too. 

As for my situation, I have had two full cranial scans by different sleep dentists who both said my nasal passage is constricted, which causes me to mouth breathe, snore, etc. Prior to using the strips, I would wake up every 3 hours or more frequently and not be able to get back to sleep. With the strips, I have slept 4 to 6 hours numerous times without awaking, and I’m able to return ti sleep faster. I have also worn a MAD for the last 5 years or so. 

What I would change first is the cost of the nose strips. At the lowest cost, they’re just under $1 per night. That’s prohibitively expensive for many people who would potentially benefit from this product. Second, the cost of entry for a starter kit is also too high for average consumers and it doesn’t even include all sizes of the device. It would be very possible to buy that and then still need a larger or smaller size since the starter kit only has 4 of 6 sizes. Maybe offer two kits, one with smaller ranges and one with larger?

The next thing I would improve is adding options for the depth of the band, especially for the larger sizes. I have a big honker, and the unless I place the sticky pads exactly on the right place, it can put a bit of pressure on the bridge on my nose. 

I like the little applicator stick to apply the stickers, I wish the intro kit included the travel case. 

Thanks for reading and thanks to the Intake folks. I know you guys read this sub, it’s a good product, but it could benefit even more people with a lower cost point.

1ptjii1,Are at-home sleep studies really any good?,"I did an at-home test with a private establishment last year and the test said I had no sleep apnea. A few months ago, I did a sleep study in a hospital and it said I have 75/h severe sleep apnea.

I was talking to my pulmonologist and neurologist (I have Restless Legs Syndrome) about it and they both told me at-home sleep studies are no good and barely reliable, if only for those maybe on the lighter side of sleep apnea. I lean towards believing them because I'm *apalled* at how the private test told me no sleep apnea when I'm actually a severe case. (And I had done it twice to be sure!)

However, when I look at this sub, it's always a suggestion to get an at-home test as if it was just as reliable as one in a hospital. What's up with that? Is it that good, I'm assuming, in the USA? (I'm Canadian.)

EDIT: I talked to my respiratory therapist that set up my CPAP today and she gave me an answer that made sense: half of my awakenings during the night are cause by central sleep apnea, which is something that can't be verified well with at-home CPAPs with the machines I loaned. It's why the hospital was the right place to diagnose my sleep apnea. Thanks Canadian private clinics :,)?",1766460563.0,4,20,SleepApnea,sleep

I definitely have issues with fatigue and staying awake during the day, Ive fallen asleep while just sitting at my desk and Ive fallen asleep driving 3 times. This is despite me getting 10+ hours of sleep, and after the first incident they recommended a sleep study. 

I had gotten the results back and the medical professional who went over them said some things were “weird” but couldnt really explain them since she isnt the doctor who reviewed the tests. Ive done my own research and its a lot of “who knows”. Im wondering if anyone whos had a polysomnograph has or can explain any of the following:

-My findings were mostly Obst. Hypopnea, Central Apnea and some Obst. Apnea. 
Almost all of the events happened when I was on my side and some on my stomach. There were no events when I was on my back. 

-Despite having a high amount of occurrences, my O2 Sat never went below 95. There were two instances where it went to 90, and both were when I was awake. 

-The two instances where it went to 90 O2 sat correlate with my heart rate dropping to 35 bpm and then back to 80. 

-Half the arousals were related to a respiratory event, the rest were non specific or leg movement. 

-I did not have any apnea or hypopnea events during REM sleep.

1pt44pu,Back on CPAP with altitude and other factors,"I was diagnosed with moderate OSA about 8 years ago. I used CPAP for 5 years, but eventually got off it after dental work, including jaw expansion. I started gaining weight about a year ago, and my Oura ring did show some changes in my breathing regularity during that time (from mostly optimal to a mix of optimal and good). Moving into temporary housing decreased that to mostly good (maybe because I was no longer sleeping on an inclined bed). However, moving to about 4300 ft elevation a couple months later had a major immediate impact, decreasing to good/fair. My HRV and other indicators had also declined, and I could tell I was sleeping worse, so I decided to take a home sleep test. Sure enough, I had moderate sleep apnea again, so I'm back on CPAP. My stay here is temporary, and I'll be back at sea level in a couple months. However, I'll definitely be cautious before I consider going off CPAP again, since there were some signs of mild sleep-breathing problems before then. At the very least I'll keep it for travel, especially to moderate altitude or higher.

Takeaways:

1. The Oura ring underestimated the problem, but did show directional trends.
2. Even if CPAP becomes no longer necessary, factors such as weight gain, travel, or even a different bed can have a big impact.
3. Elevation in particular seems to have a big impact. I had altitude sickness in the Andes a couple years ago, and in retrospect wonder if CPAP would have helped",1766421504.0,7,0,SleepApnea,sleep

1pstpar,"Insomnia isn't just tiredness – it's slowly turning you into someone else, and nobody talks about that","Throwaway for reasons that'll become clear.

I used to be the patient one. The guy who'd listen to friends vent for hours, crack jokes to lighten the mood, actually feel for people going through shit. Empathetic, chill, the ""reliable"" friend. But after months of staring at the ceiling every night, heart pounding like I'd run a marathon, that version of me... he's gone.

It starts subtle. You snap at your partner over nothing – a misplaced remote, a question asked at the wrong time. Irritation becomes your default. Everything grates: the sound of traffic, your coworker's chewing, even your own thoughts. You know it's not you, but you can't stop it. Sleep deprivation turns your brain into this wired mess where patience evaporates.

Then the empathy drains away. Someone shares their problems? You nod, but inside it's ""I don't have the energy for this."" You start avoiding people because faking concern feels exhausting. I caught myself thinking ""why can't they just deal with it?"" about things I'd normally care deeply about. It's like insomnia hollows you out, leaves a shell that's functional but cold.

The worst? The guilt. You mourn who you were – the warmer, kinder version – and blame yourself. ""If I could just sleep, I'd be me again."" But nights blend into days, and you wonder if that person is lost forever. Nobody warns you insomnia isn't just physical; it's psychological erosion. It changes your personality, bit by bit, until you're a stranger to yourself.

I hit rock bottom when I realized my relationships were cracking because of it. Snapping at loved ones, withdrawing, feeling perpetually on edge – it wasn't sustainable. That's when I stumbled on something that started pulling me back.

I tested a simple 15-minute routine on myself after reading about how anxiety fuels these cycles. Not the usual ""relax"" BS that never worked. This was different – targeted at overthinkers like me, forcing a shutdown without fighting your brain.

Before: Snappy, isolated, guilty as hell, barely holding it together. After a few weeks: Irritation dialed way down, empathy creeping back, actually laughing again. Not perfect every night, but 60-70% better? That reclaimed pieces of me I thought were gone.

The protocol's just 3 steps, printable, sits on your nightstand. But here's the thing – it's not as straightforward as it sounds...

Each part has these subtle tweaks that make or break it. Skip them, and it might not stick, leaving you right back in that spiral (I wasted nights figuring that out). For instance, the first step seems like basic tension release, but without the precise order, your body doesn't buy the ""safe"" signal and the racing thoughts persist.

I could sketch the basics here, but honestly, you'd probably miss those details and end up frustrated. Or get the full ""Anxiety Shutdown Kit"" I pieced together – 20 pages with the exact sequences, why-it-works science, troubleshooting for bad nights, and a 3-day refund if it doesn't click. I paid $33.54 for similar stuff that flopped; this one's $27 for r/insomnia peeps.

   Full details on my profile.

If you wanna try piecing it together yourself, here's the rough outline ↓

**Step 1: Quick physical reset (2 min)** – Break the anxiety spike with body cues. (But the timing's key – wrong, and it amps tension instead. Full flow in the kit.)

**Step 2: Brain empty (5 min)** – Spill thoughts on paper. (Heads up: Specific rules stop it from turning into more rumination. Details in the kit.)

**Step 3: Mind occupy (8 min)** – Neutral distraction to block worries. (3 options by how wired you are; pick wrong, and thoughts slip back. All in the kit.)

(If this resonates and you've felt that personality shift too, share below – makes me feel less alone. But if you're ready to fight back and get ""you"" again, the kit's there. No BS guarantee.)",1766389071.0,0,0,SleepApnea,sleep

I have a few questions. 

The report said I may not be able to qualify for a CPAP covered by insurance because it is so mild. Has anyone dealt with this? 

84 seems like a low oxygen level for a mild case. Prior to this test, I had been having lots of weird symptoms with my heart rate and oxygen levels during the day time, bpm spiking when going from lying down to standing or oxygen dropping as low as 91. This also seemed to happen with physical exertion. So I am wondering if there is some underlying condition since I had these issues during the day, and if anyone else has dealt with anything similar?

1psctsq,Advice.... genioglossus advancement?,"Hi, I’ve been dealing with sleep issues for over 10 years. About 10 years ago, I had an in lab sleep study that showed mild sleep apnea. I was prescribed a CPAP, but found it impossible to use. I kind of just ignored the issue, but it feels like it’s gotten worse. However I’m not sure how typical my sleep apnea is. Every time I’ve used a device or had a at home sleep test, my oxygen doesn’t drop much, but I think there are a lot of breathing related awakenings, I’m also not sure if I snore, I don’t think I always do. I think my body wakes me up before it gets to the point where my oxygen drops much. I also usually only sleep a few hours a night, it feels like my body is waking me up because of the issues breathing and it’s decided it’s better off just being awake since sleeping is difficult. 

I went to an ENT and had a sleep endoscopy done and it showed that my epiglottis was collapsing during sleep. He suggested that I get a genioglossal advancement and that this would fix the problem. I also have issues breathing through my nose at night, but this issue did not show up during the endoscopy, it only happens at home. He suggested Flonase, but I’ve tried that and it doesn’t help. Basically, I was thinking of getting another in lab sleep study done since I haven’t had one done in 10 years. The problem is I’m worried that it won’t show severe enough apnea and that if it doesn’t, then my insurance will refuse to cover the genioglossus advancement. I’m very confused about what’s going on, because even though the apnea I’ve had is mild, it’s causing severe issues. 

I’m wondering if I should try to get another in lab sleep study or not. I could just move forward with the GA, but I am worried that it will A) change the shape of my face B) what if it doesn’t solve the problem and instead just leaves me with other issues? Any advice would be welcome.

1psaf7e,Should I try a full face mask?,"Since being diagnosed with SA two years ago, I’ve gone through a few periods of trying CPAP with no luck. All with a nasal pillow mask. I would end up mouth breathing. Even tried mouth taping but it still wouldn’t work. 

I’m pretty sure I have bad nasal structure (deviated septum, or bad sinuses, or turbinate stuff, or something else) that cause my issues. (I’m a runner, and have to focus on nose breathing. If I zone out, before I know it I’m mouth breathing.)

With my (likely) nasal structure issues in mind, do you think trying a full mask could help? 

I realize that if I do in fact have nose structure issues, I should probably get those checked out instead of relying on a “bandaid” (full mask), assuming it works. But at this point I’m just really curious. 

Full mask + more restful sleep, even if there’s mouth breathing, would be much better than my current state. ",1766334383.0,2,9,SleepApnea,sleep

I’m even using supplemental oxygen with the machine, but it doesn’t seem to be improving much. 

Before I got my new machine, I was using oxygen because I thought it was better than nothing. I'm not sure how accurate that really is.

Could this be related to something like pulmonary hypertension? Or some other condition? Has anyone experienced this before?

I feel like I need to consult my sleep doctor to figure this out, because I thought using my machine would help stabilize my oxygen levels, but they still seem way off. It’s honestly kind of stressful.

1ps8mdg,Getting Positional Apnea From Scoliosis,"I've been on CPAP for 20 years. It doesn't work very well, to be honest: if the pressure is high enough to stop OSA, I get CA, as well as ""chipmunk cheeks"" which are very painful when they last for hours. I have a ResMed 9, and my pressure is 13, while my EPR is 3.

Recently, I have been getting a lot of positional apnea (PA). I never had this problem, although I breathe through my mouth a lot, and I haven't found a good, full-face mask that doesn't tend to hold my lower jaw against my upper jaw. After talking with my doctor (not my sleep doctor: I can't get an appointment until next year), she suggesed that my scoliosis might be the cause. I hunch over more than I used to, and I've actually lost two inches in height over the past few years. When I lay down, I can feel my head--I am a side sleeper--""hunch over"" so that it puts pressure on my upper jaw to close. And, like I said, this tends to make the mask push the bottom of my jaw against my upper jaw, which causes PA.

I have tried different masks, but I haven't found one that works for this. My doctor suggested a cervical collar, but I've tried two of them, and they actually push my lower jaw up as well, so my mouth is shut. Like I said, I don't think it's a pressure issue, because I've had the same pressure for years.

Has anyone else dealt with this? If so, how have you managed this? I was denied the Inspire implant because my pressure is moderate, and when I did my sleep study, I barely slept, so the PA didn't really show up. I've been thinking about talking with my sleep doc about appealing the denial to the insurance company, but I don't have much confidence that it will go through.

If anyone has another mask recommendation, I'll give that a try as well. It's just like playing ""whack a mole"" these days: I can mitigate OSA, but then I get ""chipmunk cheeks"" and CA. I tried to loosen the straps on my mask, but that makes this worse. To really drive it home, I also have tardive dsykenisa (TD) from my psych meds, so sometimes my tongue moves on its own and blocks my airway. Right now, I am using Ingrezza, but it's over $5,000 a month, so once the insurance reimbursement I'm getting through the manufacturer goes away, I won't be able to afford it.

What I really need is a good way to breathe through my nose all night through. I use Flonase and take a decongestant at bed time, but it only works some of the time. I can't use a chin strap or mouth tape, because I do need to breathe through my mouth a lot of the time. So, if anyone has advice on that as well, I would be grateful to hear it.

1ps60jm,Is this sleep apnea?,"I have had this problem for about 5 years now. I consulted multiple doctors but none told me it was sleep apnea. However, they also weren’t able to tell me what the problem was, so I was wondering what you guys think because doctors aren’t perfect and can make mistakes. 

So for about 5 years now, occasionally, while I’m on the brink of falling asleep (on my side, worse if I’m on my back), I wake up gasping for air and sometimes, it’s really scary because I’m under the impression that I’m about to die from like a heart attack or stroke. So I breathe deeply for 3-5 seconds and I’m back to normal. 

It’s really handicapping because sometimes, I’m afraid of falling asleep because I think that I might wake up in a few minutes thinking I’m about to die. 

For context, I’m 30M, I vape and sometimes smoke, and I’m a little overweight. 

I quit smoking/vaping for an entire year last year and I don’t remember having these gasping episodes during that time. However, I picked up vaping again this year and they came back, so I thought it was because of the vaping/smoking. So I quit again 10 days ago and I still had once or twice these gasping episodes at night. Maybe if I quit for a little longer, they will completely disappear, and maybe if I lose a little weight too. 

But is it the nicotine/vaping/smoking that’s causing this or does it look like sleep apnea? 

Once I’ve fallen asleep, I don’t have any problems staying asleep. It’s only when I’m on the brink of sleeping. 

I’m seeing another doctor in a week so I’ll also get his point of view,  but I thought I should ask here first.

1prmoj8,"severe sleep apnea due to anatomical issues, can’t tolerate cpap","A few months ago after a lifetime of sleep issues I was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea. The doctor told me I have enlarged tonsils and tongue with a small airway and the sleep apnea has likely been longstanding. I have a nasal pillow mask and have been unable to tolerate the machine. It actually made my sleep worse, when I was first trying to adjust I would keep it on as long as possible and would literally lie there awake the entire night. I tried using it for shorter periods and can barely tolerate more than two hours. The pillows hurt my nostrils and give them a chapped feeling and they press into my septum (I’m a stomach sleeper) which also hurts  I also fixate on the hiss sound on exhale and can’t relax. To further complicate things I have autism and ADHD and can’t stand the feeling of having something strapped to my face. It’s a sensory thing for me to have my blanket right up under my nose where I can feel and smell it and the mask makes that impossible. 

The cpap machine has become another source of sleep anxiety for me and my doctor is insisting I keep trying but I can’t even bring myself to do it. I’m not trying to be noncompliant but I truly hate the machine and don’t even want to look at it. It took me over a week to even bring myself to clean it to prepare myself for using it again. It’s been weeks since that and I brought myself to use it once and again I could only tolerate it for less than 3 hours. I read a lot and have tried many times to put it on for at least an hour prior to going to sleep and I haven’t been able to tolerate it any better. I haven’t talked to the doctor yet but I feel like she’s going to tell me to just keep trying. I work in the medical field and understand they want to start with the most noninvasive method and exhaust that prior to other treatments but I can’t just keep being told to tough it out indefinitely when I really don’t think cpap treatment is going to work for me. Has anyone else dealt with something similar and successfully convinced your doctor that you need a different treatment?

I’ve tried two masks and currently have nasal pillows which hurt my nose bc I’m a stomach sleeper.

1prjzj6,Tongue stabilizer - legitimate solution?,"Hi everyone, I'd like to get some help from the group here on figuring out my apnea therapy. I've been at this for six months now with the AirCurve 11 (currently) and I'm not finding any success. I think my tongue dropping off the roof of my mouth is my main issue.

Here are the last 30 days of my SleepHQ data, plus Apple Watch data too: [https://sleephq.com/public/teams/share\_links/ad3abcd6-da1b-4a70-b1b2-b95d2f1544ec/dashboard](https://sleephq.com/public/teams/share_links/ad3abcd6-da1b-4a70-b1b2-b95d2f1544ec/dashboard) 

I'm going to try to condense my history as best I can into bullet points.

**BACKGROUND:**

* **2022:** Had a tonsillectomy because I showed an AHI of 30 on a sleep test and was waking up gasping for breath. The surgery reduced my AHI to 3 and I felt subjectively much better. 
* **2023-2024:** Definitely experienced periods of fatigue that were usually related to waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to go back to sleep. I assumed this was a psychological issue related to anxiety and sleep maintenance insomnia because I was shown to ""not have apnea anymore."" So I worked on some psychological approaches, but didn't really find any success with the night wakings. 
* **Late 2023:** Decided I needed to get tested for apnea again and found that it had increased to around 10 on a sleep study. I had gained weight so I tried to lose weight. I lost a significant amount of weight, about 20 pounds, but yet I still did not feel better and I still showed that I had an AHI around 8 on the post-weight-loss sleep study. 

**CPAP ATTEMPTS:**

* **First try:** Got an AirSense 10 through insurance. Did not help. I could not get full face mask to seal. I'm a mouth breather and realized I haven't been able to breathe through my nose all my life. Tried nasal pillows and could not breathe at all so I gave up quickly. 
* **ENT Surgery:** Consulted an ENT and got surgery to reduce my turbinates with a microdebrider device and also fixed my deviated septum. I can now breathe through my nose again. Which is really nice. 
* **Second try:** Tried CPAP again but auto pressures were no good. When I tried to raise pressure it felt like too much and would wake me up. I started reading UARS subreddit and Barry Krakow and did a consultation with him. I decided I would try to get a bilevel machine. I got my insurance to pay for it and I currently have an AirCurve 11. 

**BiPAP TITRATION JOURNEY:**

* Decided to get into self-titration because I wanted to try to solve the problem with BiPAP before moving onto more serious options like surgery. I started working with a sleep tech who I'm still working with now to try to titrate myself. I also consulted with Dr. Barry Krakow and he encouraged me to focus on nasal issues before figuring out best PAP pressures. 
* Used the BiPAP and tried a lot of different pressures to see what worked. I tried lots of things. Tried EPAP up to around 7 and then raising PS up from 4.  
* Around like 7 EPAP, 12 IPAP on S mode I couldn't tolerate it and backed off. I tried other settings, somewhere between like 5-10 EPAP and 4-8 PS, and nothing really worked. Higher PS seemed to cause leaks and definitely caused very bad aerophagia so I got a little scared of higher PS. 
* Since then I have experimented with higher EPAP. For weeks I've been using CPAP 13 with EPR 2. I don't feel as BLOWN UP as I do with higher pressure support, so it’s more comfortable. But at the same time I still am getting really inconsistent results. I wake up frequently throughout the night and just can't seem to get any solid sleep. 
* I still feel extreme fatigue nearly every day. Yet my AHI from the machine usually shows like somewhere between 0-2.  

**CSMA SLEEP STUDY (Dr. Jerald Simmons):**

* Frustrated with BiPAP not helping, I got a sleep study done at the CSMA clinic with Dr. Simmons in September. Flew to Texas from NJ for it. They found that my optimal pressure was 8 CPAP with EPR 2. They said pressures above that exacerbated leak. They did not even try me on BiPAP because they said all events were resolved enough at 8 EPR 2. 
* Later on Dr. Simmons told me that he thinks the Pes device actually stimulated my nasal airway and that that's why I had subjectively one of my best nights while there. Which, of course I thought was weird given all the wires I was hooked up to. But I really did feel I slept great. So he thought I probably needed more. 
* I consulted with Simmons after the test and he thought that actually something like 10/5 pressure made more sense because the Pes device probably overstimulated my nose giving a wrong result. Didn't feel great about going to Texas for that, but whatever. 
* Simmons also said that UARS is sleep apnea and there's really no reason to use the term UARS. So I didn't even get a real ""UARS diagnosis,"" but that said, he believes lower-obstruction arousals are included in the definition of apnea, so he's not writing me off or anything—he does think I have apnea. He just defines it differently. 
* I have not gotten much help from CSMA since then. I keep calling to ask for help given how horrible my sleep has been but they are very reluctant to do anything unless I have an appointment, and it's hard to get on their schedule unless you have many weeks' advance notice. 
* I also was tested for narcolepsy and hypersomnolence by CSMA (Simmons' clinic) and was negative. 

**CURRENT SITUATION:**

* Simmons' office is saying that I should give each pressure change two weeks to see if it helps me. I just don't understand that because in a sleep study, they change you every couple minutes if they feel your events are not being resolved. So why do I need to wait so long to make pressure changes? I really don't have so much time to suffer. 
* I am also not sure how much my nose is an issue. I am over 6 months post-turbinate/septum surgery. Up until a month ago, I used mometasone nasal rinse nightly (similar to fluticasone or Flonase) as well as azelastine nasal spray twice a day. But I stopped using all of this because I find that my nose doesn't feel any different with it. When I am upright during the day I can breathe well through my nose and it's great that I can do this for the first time in my life. 
* BUT I do feel my nose blocks up on the side I'm sleeping on at night. With the nasal pillows I feel I can breathe through my nose, but it's probably not perfect. And I use mouth tape and Intake nasal strips and a cervical collar. 
* Btw I've tried Afrin a few nights and don't notice a big difference. 
* **My setup:** AirCurve 11 and P10 nasal pillows mask. Generally the mask feels comfortable for me. 

**MY CURRENT CONUNDRUM:**

I am currently slowly increasing my pressures by 0.4 every night to see if it helps. But for example, last night I woke up multiple times after moving up from 13.6 EPR 2 to 14 EPR 2. Why was the sleep so much worse than the night before? I have no idea. But looking at my Apple Watch data I am waking up constantly.

My theory is that my biggest problem is my tongue dropping during REM. This happens to me nearly every night. When I am near waking time, I feel air rushing into my mouth behind my mouth tape and it wakes me up. Since I'm using a cervical collar and mouth tape (and I've used chin strap in the past too) I’ve struggled to solve this. I've experimented with what's happening when I'm awake and I'm pretty sure that even with those things in place, my tongue is dropping off the roof of my mouth. I've tried training my tongue to stay in place during the day but it just doesn't seem to work later in the night.

The other issue that I frequently experience is wetness in the tape I'm using. I use kinesiology tape horizontally across my lips and then I cover that over with a larger strip of Cover Roll stretch tape going cheek to cheek. I do have a beard so this kind of set up is the only thing that really works. The wetness seems to get better when the humidity is at one versus two, but it's inconsistent and sometimes I just get wetness regardless of the humidity level. It's hard to tell if it's caused by the humidity or the mouth opening and drooling or both.

**TONGUE STABILIZER EXPERIMENTS:**

I bought a cheap tongue stabilizer device ([this one](https://www.amazon.com/Snoring-Solution-Anti-Snore-Reusable-Stopper/dp/B0FXGFWFWT)) on Amazon and tried it last night. It did seem to keep my tongue in place but when I put on my nasal pillow, the pressure got really tight in my mouth and started squeezing my tongue and so I'm not sure if it would work along with CPAP. That said I was very curious to see if it would work and I'm thinking of trying it tonight without CPAP just to see what kind of effect that has on my sleep. The problem is I think I still need CPAP because I'm not really able to breathe through my nose without the nasal pillows.

I'm exploring some tongue stabilizing solutions and am hopeful that these may help me, though I'm not sure if they'll work alongside CPAP:

* Good Morning Snore Solution
* AveoTSD
* Airwaav
* NoseBreathe (trainer or full mouthpiece)
* QuitSnoringSolution ST-2

I'm hopeful that maybe something like the Airwaav or NoseBreathe might work better because it keeps my tongue on a shelf and creates natural suction, and not held in place by suction, which is uncomfortable.

I'm open to trying a mouth guard to see if keeping my jaw in place might also help keep my tongue on the roof of my mouth too. I've tried the ZQuiet one and it was very painful so I couldn't continue with it. But maybe holding my jaw forward is what I need.

I'm also very curious about the iNap device. I'm wondering if that might be what's needed to keep my tongue in place and prevent the drop which causes the air to flood into my mouth.

I should mention that I also at one point tried the MouthShield to try to keep my mouth closed, but I found that it was very painful and uncomfortable and I don't think it really helped anyway with my tongue location.

**BOTTOM LINE:**

I'd like to at least eliminate the tongue drop variable so I can figure out then if I need more PAP pressure and what to do from that point forward.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",1766252344.0,1,1,SleepApnea,sleep
1prjp3i,"Need some reassurance, anxiety is killing me","For the last 2 months or so I have had terrible sleep, 4-6 hours a night with waking up 2-3 times (that Im aware off), restless legs, extreme exhaustion (got worse over time) and feel physically very weak, dry mouth, over time I got anxious and depressed, more frequently having a sleeping/numb hand

Finally called the doc for some sleep meds, which did nothing, did get myself a referral to a psychological program, but nothing on the sleep front (blamed the sleep issues on stress from water damage in my home and having to handle all that, sand, paint etc the chaos being hard to deal with as an autistic and chronically ill person)

So after my visit to the doc I had a lightbulb moment and looked up sleep apnea and all my symptoms match up

Dont know if this is related or not, since a week Im struggling with eating, had nausea for several weeks before that, but now big loss of appetite and difficulty to actually eat something (did get meds for that)

I did get new pillows this summer, so I switched back to my old one and made sure I cant sleep on my back, I am obese and gained 16 kilos on my thyroid meds sinds august 2024

Anyways I have to wait the weekend before I can call my GP and get a referral to a sleep clinic, off course getting tested, the results and starting treatment will take a few weeks

My anxiety is killing me, it just wants me to belief I’ll drop dead any moment, I wont wake up one of these days and off course because Im so freaking exhausted its incredibly hard to combat that parasitic voice


Any reassurance you can give me would be greatly welcomed

Any tips you can give me to combat the anxiety, please do so


Im socially isolated since I have been chronically ill with a bunch of other stuff for many years and cant keep calling my 2 friends to deal with my fears, but feel like climbing my walls in loneliness/isolation (these feelings are off course elevated due to my lack of sleep)

1prhno2,Pregnant & stinky breath,"Hey folks. I’m a few months into my CPAP journey (moderate OSA, AHI = 17.2), and it’s been life changing - I took to CPAP no problem (except for rainout issues), and was happily compliant.  I no longer got up to pee in the night, I had so much energy, and I couldn’t take a nap anymore if my life depended on it (previously a daily napper). Then I got pregnant, and everything changed. 

I’m not sure why (hormones?? Increasing blood volume??) but all the sudden I couldn’t stand my nose mask anymore and felt like it was suffocating me and I’d wake up after a couple hours and rip it off. Then, I got influenza A and couldn’t breathe through my nose and could no longer use the nose mask. The sleep study company gave me a loaner full faced mask when I was sick to try and it’s been much better - I finally feel like I can breathe, and the claustrophobia feeling is gone and I seem to be sleeping with my mouth open now so the full face mask works better. However, now I’m finding that in early pregnancy, I’m hyper sensitive to smells and (despite brushing my teeth before bed) about halfway through the night I wake up and can’t stand the smell of my own breath and can’t sleep because of it. Unfortunately, I’m also an Invisalign user so brushing my teeth is a whole process of removing the aligners so doing that mid-night is likely to wake me up too much.

1prg93l,Do I have sleep apnea?,"I feel like I’ve only recently connected my sleeping experiences to sleep apnea after reading about people who have it, but I’m still not sure.

About me: I’m a 22-year-old woman, 52 kg. I don’t snore when I sleep, but I have severe allergic rhinitis. I’m just really concerned because I often experience sleep paralysis. My sleep paralysis started when I was 18 years old. It doesn’t happen every day, but I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve experienced it.

In my case, there haven’t been any bad elements appearing, but I do hallucinate. There are events where I think I’m doing something or seeing something, but it’s all just in my head. After that event in my mind, I wake up mentally aware, but I can’t control my body. I really struggle and fight just to wake up. Then, once I finally wake up, I feel anxious and I’m gasping for air. My heartbeat is very fast, too. I also feel extremely tired, like I ran a marathon, and somehow depressed because it’s so frustrating.

Also, these days, for reasons I can’t explain, I always get sleep paralysis whenever I sleep at night in a specific room in our house. It’s really specific. My sleep paralysis seems to choose that room lately, so I’ve been avoiding sleeping there.

I also have several sleeping problems, such as sleeping for very long hours, always 12 hours or more when I don’t need to wake up early or don’t have any plans. At the same time, I’m a very light sleeper. Even when I’m in deep sleep, if I hear people talking, I wake up immediately, and most of the time I can’t fall back asleep right away.

My sleeping patterns are extremely inconsistent, and I feel like that’s a big factor in why my anxiety is high, being moody and why my brain always feels foggy.

Getting diagnosed is expensive, and I don’t know where to start, so I just keep guessing what the root cause of my sleeping problems and sleep paralysis might be. I hope I can gain some clarity.",1766242745.0,3,2,SleepApnea,sleep

1pqar5l,I'm going rogue,"I was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea (7.4) and PLMD a few months ago (which I also posted about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/1ogjnhc/diagnosed_with_mild_sleep_apnea_and_mild_plmd_but/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) ) . As some people commented on that post, the initial treatment seemed a bit off but I think my doctor had the following reasoning-

I have three separate sleep issues which are all mild:

\- apneas

\- PLMD

\- spontaneous arousals 

I am borderline underweight so ""just loosing"" weight was not really an option, and perhaps because my current insurance doesn't cover CPAP treatment the doctor decided to treat the PLMD first. So for a month I took Mirapex (0.25mg) but did not feel much of a difference other than sleeping less than before (never more than 6h/night) but still being equally tired. The doctor then decided to try and treat the PLMD and the spontaneous arousals at the same time, so I was prescribed Mirapex and Xanax (0.25mg). I didn't really feel any difference besides now being able to sleep 8h although still feeling equally tired.  
Now it's month 3 since I was diagnosed and since I didn't really feel any difference with the recent medication the doctor instead prescribed Mirapex and Rivotril (0.25mg) to see if that worked better. So far I haven't felt any difference at all. 

I am not too excited about just trying a bunch of medications and see what happens when I see lots of people here with an AHI similar to mine who have benefited greatly from CPAP treatment. Luckily, in my home country you can buy CPAP machines without any prescription so I decided to just go rogue and have now ordered a machine which will arrive just in time for Christmas when I am going home anyway. It's a ""Philips DreamStation 2 Advanced Auto CPAP"" and I am planning on doing the home CPAP titration that I have heard is somewhat common. I bought the CPAP-mask AirFit F30i to begin with although I am aware I might have to experiment a bit with different masks. 

  
Since I know there are a few people here who have gone the ""home CPAP titration"" route, so I just wonder if you have any tips or recommendations that I should keep in mind once I get started? ",1766114927.0,2,5,SleepApnea,sleep

Started CPAP 3 weeks ago, and got the mask fitting great 2.5 weeks ago at which point I started wearing it all night.

Objectively my sleep is better. I'm down to <0.5 AHI, not waking up to pee at all which I didn't even think was possible, as I usually woke at least 3 x per night. Plus tossing and turning. Subjectively I feel like I'm sleeping more deeply as well.

I purchased a v-com and used it last night. Ramp was the best feature for me. It makes so much difference.  The only thing ai dont like it how top heavy the mask is with the tubing on top of my head. I might try different masks to see what works better. 

I'm not sure what to do about feeling bloated. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!

I have been trying the CPAP consistently for a week and had nothing but issues between the air not venting right, getting little support in making adjustments, etc. 

I’ve worn Invisalign before and assume the dental device will feel similar albeit with some added push to move the lower jaw forward. 


Because of this I’m wondering what the possible drawbacks would be of switching to a prescription dental device beyond the money. Do any of you have experience with this and what do you recommend?

1pox2oq,"2 month update after CPAP, good and bad.","Was waiting to post an update until I had time to really get everything sorted so I could just throw it all into one post. Here is my original post...

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/1ocbzdr/going\_to\_need\_help\_after\_a\_long\_resistance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/1ocbzdr/going_to_need_help_after_a_long_resistance/)

I tend to ramble a bit, but I'll try to keep this condensed.

The good.

Even after the worst nights of sleep on the CPAP I have never had to take another nap mid day. Getting tired and falling asleep in my chair has been a staple of my life for several years now, and ever since day 2-3 on CPAP I have not need those naps anymore.

Pain in my chest so bad that went through to my back when I woke up from the CPAP pressure on my lungs went away after about 2 weeks.

Daily heart rate has dropped. So much so I avoid looking at my fitbit HR sometimes so I won't freak out. Most importantly, my HR while I sleep has changed dramatically. It hovers around a stable 55-60 rather than 65-75+ w drops/spikes like it used to.

I'm more used to the machine. I tweaked it after reading a lot on here so now I use 7-20 instead of 5-20 and the EXP I dropped from 3 to 2 and those changes dropped my AHI from 5's to 1's.

The Bad

2 side affects from the CPAP. I know these are not common, but I now get slight vertigo during the day (possibly from inner ear pressure changes) and the other is I have ringing in my ears sometimes when I wake up. Neither is debilitating, but both symptoms only came after I started therapy...although one could argue that perhaps my increased anxiety is the cause of the vertigo spells. I do not have claustrophobia, but I still get anxious when I put the mask on for some reason.

Also, I can't sleep in...I know it's not really a negative, but on the weekends when I wake up, it's done. My body says "" i know it's 7:30 am, but you're good to go. No more sleep for you""  


Last thing...ever day I wake up and see my pressure listed from overnight was somewhere between 10's at 13's. Never higher or lower. Should I try and limit the machine range a bit more?

1pouisg,DIY positional device worked first night!,"I use a free app called Dream Talk, which records not only when I talk in my sleep (every night lol) but more importantly, is sensitive enough to record snoring and apnea events.  Although two sleep studies said moderate apnea, they didn’t recommend CPAP so I’ve been on my own trying to figure this out.  From listening to struggles to breathe when sleeping, it’s obvious to me I have the obstruction type when sleeping on my back and I probably need the MMA surgery.  

I tried buying the special shirt where you insert tennis balls to keep me off my back, but the shirt would just slide around on my body, so it was completely ineffective and I sent it back after the first week.

I decided to troubleshoot it and went shopping yesterday and created my own and lo and behold at worked the first night!  I feel much better this morning, and checking my Dream Talk app I had only ONE episode of sleeping on my back and that’s the one that woke me up.

Here are the things I bought:

1. Shorts with belt loops.  The belt loops are key so that the tennis balls don’t slip around. As a woman, I could not find any women’s shorts so I found the smallest size men’s shorts and bought them and luckily they fit me.

2. Three tennis balls. (I don’t play tennis so I just bought three dog balls at Walmart.)

3. A pair of women’s tights.

I threaded the tights through the belt loops, cut the toes out of the feet of the tights, and put the three balls in the back.  (See pix).  The tights can then be tied in front.

This ended up being cheaper than the version sold, as well as working because it did not slip around at all. I hope this idea helps somebody else. ",1765971931.0,24,12,SleepApnea,sleep

I’m 24M healthy weight. I have mild sleep apnea and severe symptoms but no physical life-threatening symptoms. I haven’t had any progress in the last few months with being able to sleep with cpap. I can fall asleep, but I wake up quickly because once the pressure rises above like 6 my cheeks are blown open even though I’m using a full face mask and am breathing through my mouth (I have a deviated septum and getting the surgery in February). I’ve already tried different masks, tubing, different pressures, changing the EPR, over/undertightening the mask, I’ve tested about every setting on the machine. No professional I’ve talked to knows wtf they’re doing and they say I need to get used to it (it’s been 3 months and I’ve made zero progress with getting used to it..). I’ve noticed that when I’m awake and testing a higher pressure like 12 if I’m really focusing on exhaling completely (even though it feels difficult) the chipmunk cheeks reduces a lot, but I can’t sustain that when I’m awake, let alone magically do it when I’m asleep? 

I also have borderline personality disorder, and sleep apnea has taken over my life. I’ve been in therapy (CBT and DBT) and taking meds (many different ones tried) for years but I think my sleep apnea is preventing me from healing past a certain point because I’ve been trying every day but my cognitive deficit makes me have a hard time with thinking through healthy skills and my body feels so vulnerable it wants to keep me feeling bad to protect myself. I haven’t discovered my sleep apnea until this past year because everyone told me I was just lazy or other negative things growing up and I believed that. High school was very, very, very difficult for me and I think I still have burnout/trauma from going way past my limit every single day for so long. Very rarely could I go to classes in college, I just skated by, and I can’t work because that type of cognitive exertion for me is extremely mentally straining. I know for a fact it has severely impacted my social life too and still does because I have a very hard time following and participating in conversations. I am quite, quite desperate at this point and I would really do anything to relieve my sleep apnea. Literally if it fixed it I would go without a tongue to feel normal otherwise

Anyways, this issue is extremely frustrating and I don’t know what to do and none of the professionals I’ve talked to are any help. As a last resort I asked chatgpt and it suggested I ask to use a bipap? Would that help? Is there anything else I should do? I’m very desperate

1pocolo,Tips and Experiences to Share?,"Hello all! I’ll give you a quick background. I’m 29M, and have always felt generally fatigued. Not so much so that I don’t do things, but everything feels like a chore. My brain feels slow compared to others, complex thinking can be difficult, and my working memory sucks. I’ve never woken up from sleep and said, “Wow, I feel refreshed and ready to start the day.” I’ve never felt energized after resting, I’ve always felt somehow worse than before I fell asleep.

Fast forward to now and I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD, got on a good combination of medicine to manage the symptoms, and have done a lot of hard work in therapy. However, the chronic fatigue and sluggishness remain. The symptoms are better with the medication, but I still feel extremely sluggish in the morning and god-forbid if I read in the afternoon because I WILL fall asleep. So, I decided to try a sleep study (turns out I do have a deviated septum). 

I got an at-home sleep study done and my RDI is 12, and I understand the at-home tests tend to underestimate the actual amount of sleep disturbances. I have mild sleep apnea (which is vindicating) and I’m waiting on the call to get my CPAP machine delivered.

1pocisu,Finally got my machine today...,"
Ugh. I’ve been through the literal wringer trying to get this machine. I was originally told they would ship the machine to me and that I could watch a tutorial video at home instead of having to go into their office. Apparently,  insurance requires tutorials on how to use the machine. 

Then today...when my machine was supposed to ship this week...they called and said they needed to do a home visit. A home visit? I've NEVER heard of a DME needing to do a home visit. 

A home visit doesn’t really work for me since I have two dogs who are TERRIFIED of people. To make matters worse, they then said they couldn’t even come to my home until sometime after January 1st. They couldn't give me a date at this time as I needed to wait for them to call me. I've been doing nothing but waiting. 

As you all know I need this machine ASAP and simply can’t wait any longer. After a brief sobbing breakdown, I checked online and saw they had an appointment available today at 1 p.m., so I took it...even though I had to drive almost an hour to get there. Luckily for me someone cancelled their appointment and I was able to snag it. I'm so grateful!

I don’t understand why they weren’t upfront with me. If I hadn’t been so desperate, I would have gone with a different DME. I'm sitting in the DME's office waiting for them to call me back as I type this.

 So I'm done with my appointment  and thankfully, I was able to get the machine. I'm now home and fully set up my machine. 

They gave me the ResMed AirCurve 11 ASV, and I honestly can’t explain the sheer RELIEF I feel having it now. 

Ive been noticing that my hands have been swelling while I sleep, which is another sign that my body hasn’t been coping well with low oxygen levels. Knowing I finally have this machine gives me so much hope that things will start improving.

1po38cc,All the symptoms fit sleep apnea / UARS… but my data and partner observations don’t — worried I won’t be diagnosed,"My below post got a bit too long, so **TL;DR:** Tons of symptoms pointing to mild sleep apnea/UARS (fatigue, brain fog, hormones off, family history), but wearables look great and my partner rarely sees events. Sometimes my SpO₂ drops to the low 80s. Worried my sleep study will miss it, even though it fits everything. Looking for similar experiences.

\-----------------------

Hey everyone, I’m hoping to get insight from people who’ve been through something similar, especially those with mild sleep apnea or UARS.

For many years I’ve been dealing with persistent daytime fatigue, low energy, low motivation/drive, brain fog, and ADHD-like symptoms (poor focus, poor follow-through, mental exhaustion). I also have elevated blood pressure, higher LDL cholesterol that is NOT hereditary (plus very healthy diet), and borderline-low hormones despite being otherwise healthy, active, and relatively thin. I've optimized my testosterone, blood tests show no issues with thyroid, great Vitamin D, iron, and magnesium levels but all symptoms remain.

Because of all this, sleep apnea keeps coming up as a possible explanation — but the confusing part is that a lot of the classic signs don’t really fit me.

**Things that make me doubt I have sleep apnea:**

* My partner has only seen me stop breathing once or twice ever
* I don’t snore regularly (maybe occasionally, not nightly)
* I only wake up gasping & choking maybe once every couple of months
* My Oura ring and Garmin watch show excellent sleep scores
* Sleep architecture looks great (good REM & deep sleep)
* Average nighttime SpO₂ is usually 93–95%
* Resting heart rate and HRV are great
* I’m fairly thin, with a neck circumference \~16 inches

**Things that keep me worried anyway:**

* I’m always tired, even after objectively “good” sleep
* I wake up unrefreshed and with a dry mouth every morning
* I yawn constantly during the day
* I sometimes wake up with jaw pain / teeth soreness (possible bruxism)
* I have a large tongue and a deviated septum
* Occasionally my wearables show SpO₂ drops into the low 80s (81–85%), though not every night
* My morning cortisol is low
* IGF-1 is low-normal
* My dad has diagnosed sleep apnea
* Stress tolerance is low and my nervous system feels “stuck in low gear”
* I’ve had these symptoms since teenage years, which makes me wonder about long-standing sleep-disordered breathing

**What really messes with my head is this:**  
I’m afraid that I don’t have sleep apnea — even though the symptoms all line up — and that I’ll be told everything is “normal” again.

I’ve been dealing with this for a very long time and have spent way too much time, money, and energy trying to figure out what’s wrong — labs, hormones, supplements, lifestyle changes, etc. At this point, sleep apnea (or UARS) almost feels like it fits the bill more than anything else plus it would be a very fixable cause for most of my issues...

Honestly, I would almost welcome a diagnosis — not because I want a condition, but because it’s treatable and would finally give me a clear path forward instead of more ambiguity.

I do have an upcoming appointment with a sleep clinic, but I’m worried that:

* A single “good night” during the study could miss something mild
* Mild apnea or UARS won’t show up clearly
* I’ll fall into that gray zone where nothing is treated even though I feel awful

So I guess my questions are:

* Has anyone here had sleep apnea or UARS with mostly “good” wearable data (Oura, Garmin, Apple Watch)?
* Did anyone have normal or near-normal oxygen averages but still feel terrible?
* Did anyone get diagnosed with sleep apnea without their partner ever really noticing them stop breathing or snoring?
* Did treatment (CPAP, oral appliance, etc.) still help even with a low AHI?

I appreciate any experiences or advice. Thanks for reading.",1765895115.0,6,16,SleepApnea,sleep

I'm going to get a second opinion and I have a pulmonology appointment coming up.

RECOMMENDATIONS:  
Consider treatment of mild sleep apnea with positive pressure, an oral appliance, ENT surgical intervention, and/or weight reduction based on clinical findings.

Consider referring the patient to \*\* Sleep Disorders Center for CPAP  
titration. Alternatively, consider initiating APAP between 4 and 20 cm  
water pressure and follow the clinical response and therapeutic download.

According to Medicare guidelines, a patient with an AHI between 5 and 14 can qualify for CPAP only if there is concomitant excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, mood disorder, cognitive dysfunction, hypertension, history of stroke, or ischemic heart disease.

Consider treatment with an oral appliance or ENT surgical intervention based on clinical findings.

Advise the patient to reduce weight if clinically appropriate.

Hi everyone

I’ve been dealing with sleep apnea for many years and I’m honestly at a breaking point. I started on Auto CPAP and it took a long time to get used to sleeping with it. Even after adapting, I continued to wake up exhausted with severe fatigue every day.

Because CPAP wasn’t helping, one of my doctors eventually switched me to BiPAP, hoping it would improve things—but unfortunately, my symptoms have stayed pretty much the same.

I use both SleepHQ and OSCAR, but I don’t really understand the graphs. The only things I feel comfortable interpreting are AHI (obstructive events), hours slept, IPAP, EPAP, and pressure support (PS). Beyond that, I’m lost.

Over the years I’ve tried *many* different settings:

* Very low inhale/exhale pressures
* Much higher pressures
* Medium/“balanced” pressures

There have been a few rare days where I felt slightly better, but even then I still felt terrible overall. I don’t understand why this is so hard to figure out or if there’s some kind of “magic” setting that I’m missing.

I’ve had one in-lab titration study. During that study, the tech set me at a fixed pressure of 7 with EPR of 3. That setup never helped me at all.

# Recent pulmonologist visit

I recently visited a sleep pulmonologist, brought my machine with me, and asked for help. The doctor told me that my pressure was too high and that I’m getting mostly **central sleep apneas**. He recommended lowering the pressure to **6 or 7**, but I’ve had no luck with that so far.

The past few days, I’ve felt *slightly* less terrible, but nothing close to what I used to experience. I’m still searching for that elusive ""magic number"" of settings that will get me back to a good, refreshing night’s sleep.

# Additional symptom

For the past \~4 years, I’ve had another strange symptom:

When I wake up—and sometimes throughout the day—my body will *automatically* start taking deep breaths on its own. When this happens, I often have to lie down and let it happen. I go into a semi-awake, semi-asleep state while my body continues these deep, automatic breaths.

Afterward, I feel like I regain *some* energy and can function enough to do the next activity. It’s far from perfect, but honestly, it has felt life-saving. Without this happening, I don’t think I’d be able to function at all.

# Sleep studies

* In almost all studies, I slept poorly compared to home
* Took a long time to fall asleep in the lab

# Data sharing

I’ve shared my SleepHQ link already. I’m not sure of the best way to share my OSCAR data, but  I’m more than willing to share my SD machine data directly with anyone who’s knowledgeable and willing to help.

I’m genuinely asking for help at this point. If anyone can look at my data or point me in the right direction, I would deeply appreciate it. This has been affecting my life for years, and I’m trying everything I can to get better.

I also discovered since then that I was quite deficient in iron, and maybe it’s just wishful thinking/placebo effect, but I feel like my energy levels are starting to pick up after about a week and a half of iron supplements.

I received my CPAP machine about a week ago, and while I know it isn’t a unique experience to hate it at first…I really do and have been finding myself daydreaming about driving to the beach and chucking the damn thing in the ocean. Some of the issues could be potentially resolved with trying different masks, but others are just intrinsic parts of being on CPAP that I don’t want anything to do with. I work in the medical field, and if I had an AHI of 80, finding a way to make it work would be a no brainer, but with an AHI of 5.8, recently discovered iron deficiency that may have been the culprit behind a lot of my symptoms all along, and recent weight loss to an almost normal BMI and plan to lose another 15 to 20 lbs, I’m struggling with the idea of incorporating something I hate this much into my life.

1pmkgne,Nasal device recommendations,"Hi all,

I have a mildly deviated septum and can breath fine during the day with no issues. The moment I lay down, one or both of my nostrils collapse, forcing me to breathe through my mouth.

If I force my muscles to open up my nostrils (the muscles at the tip of my nostrils), it's usually enough to allow unimpeded airflow through that nostril. My nostril(s) are only blocked due to a small contact point between two flaps of skin, depending on which I side I sleep gravity pulls the flap down and makes contact, so it's not like they're completely swollen shut like severe cases.

1pmd5ie,8 Months INSPIRE via Vik Veer Update,"The day they turned it on, I warned Vik and the rep that it is moving my tongue on my exhales and not my inhales

I was told this is normal, and during sleep, when my breathing slows down, it will sync perfectly 

I went away and gave it a go

Tried it alone and was devastated the next day so I combined the inspire with my BIPAP 

Didn’t really notice much or any improvements until I got to level 5/10

So I then trialled it without the BIPAP for a week and I was far from treated but felt as id feel on the BIPAP alone so thought let’s stick with this for a bit 

Not long after I felt terrible 

And I pushed everyday until a month ago when I had a follow up 

The 6 months of pushing through with the inspire alone took its toll on me I’m not gna lie

Worse I’ve been in the longest time

During my follow up I stressed to Vik and the rep it’s completely out of sync 

I even posted this on the FB forums

They all would tell me when asleep it works 

I’ve woken up in the night MANY times with an extremely slowed breathing rate, and even further slowed it down manually and guess what, it’s still all on the exhale 

Vik stuck a camera down my nose and we watched it as I breathed 

Completely out of sync like I said

And I again slowed my breathing to all paces you can imagine 

Sadly, the rep could only play around with a few settings

Strength
Duration of zap
And when it zaps…

Their software was somehow showing perfect timing of the zap on the inhale 

We managed to change the timing of the zap 
Sadly, the timing setting was very limited 

I think it had 2 changes possible which I went with 

Instead of basically missing 10/10 breaths 

It now would miss 4/10 breaths 

Sounds amazing right 

Well the problem is, I have hypervigalance 

If any breath is obstructed I wake up instantly, no apnea events 

So even tho I do feel improved a fair bit, I’m still FAR from treated effectively 

I’m kinda stuck as to what to do now….

There’s no point seeing Vik and the rep again because we maxed the settings 

I have emailed inspire but not got a reply 

I’m going to try dual therapy again tonight but I’m concerned I’ve got to get used to BIPAP again which is gna be a big problem 

My problem with air way pressure therapy is
- chipmunk cheeks 
- a heavy tongue that fills the hole and no amount of pressure moves it out the way, just pushed it in further 

👆🏻 both of these wake me up instantly all night long 


The only thing left for me to try is MMA
A dentist level MAD 
And a custom made large TRD 

I’ve used trd’s & mad’s off Amazon 
Mads were terrible 
And the TRD seemed to work a little bit before stopping a week later - making me think my tongue stretched out or something

Such a shame the TRD’s are so small
If I could use a big one I think I’d be sorted 

Anyway, I feel like I’m dying

I’m on an elvis Presley combo 

Edibles to block rem and sleep better
Stims to wake me up and work 

RHR is sky high 

We’ll see how dual therapy goes

Does anybody think a custom made MAD would be worth a shot considering it’s gna cost me £2k?

I’ll maybe try a mid range one first 

What else can I do guys?

Facts: he is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and sleep apnea. He is 41 years old, 6’2 and about 320lbs. He carries all his weight in his belly. He also chews tobacco several times a day including before bed. 

Although he was diagnosed with sleep apnea years ago and has many different sleep devices including the CPAP, he’s refused to wear any of it. I recently stopped sleeping over his home because I was so upset that we can’t sleep together due to his severe sleep apnea and extremely disturbing snoring. (I’ve compromised for months using earplugs, noise machines and ultimately sleeping in separate rooms)

What frustrates me is he knows he has these health conditions and says he desires to change, but he simply won’t put in the effort to stay consistent! We just recently tried to sleep together with his CPAP on and it worked actually fine 1 night but the next night it was terrible. He was fed up with me, he took off the CPAP and slept in another room. 

Every time we can’t sleep together it almost feels like it’s my fault. The way he acts, it’s like I caused his sleep issues. Am I being gaslit?

1pm4hx2,Could a car accident cause my sleep apnea?,"I (42m) was recently (~6 months ago) diagnosed with OSA (67 events/hr.) and now on a CPAP machine (down to 5 events/hr.). Probably will be even better since I’ve only used the machine for less than a week. I didn’t have sleep, breathing, or snoring issues prior to the diagnosis. However, I was hit (driver’s side) in a car accident a year ago that resulted in multiple herniated discs and a traumatic brain injury (TBI). I’m also being referred to a neurosurgeon because my lumbar pain has been getting worse. Now, I’ve read research that opine spine related injuries can cause OSA, and TBIs can also cause OSA. Is this medically factual?

There’s a wrinkle here… my BMI is 36 now, and has been for the last 10 years or so. I understand obesity also has correlation to OSA. So (and thanks for reading this far)… here’s the thing. I’ve been an athlete for much of my life. I ran a half marathon 10 years ago with a 30.8 BMI (no walking time of 2 hrs. 7 mins). I rowed nationally competitive intercollegiate crew with a 28-29 BMI (almost no fat on me though), while running a 5 min 20 sec mile. During my entire life, my BMI was high, though I was never viewed as obese and never had OSA.

I started CPAP about two weeks ago, and despite the diagnosis being mild, I noticed big changes in my energy levels immediately and they've only become more obvious since. Many of these changes are positive: I feel less brain fog, especially in the morning, mornings are much easier in general, I get less tired during the day, my memory is better and I generally feel more alert. But the weird thing is that my mood has shifted from feeling depressed and lethargic all the time to feeling anxious and fidgety. I feel like I have way more energy but it's mostly going towards anxiety, like my brain doesn't know what to do with it. I feel like I've gone from one mental health extreme to another.

1pluz5x,Trying to manage intermittent nasal blockage before sleep,"Hello,

I have a few nasal issues (deviated septum, turbinate hypotrophy, concha bullosa) that I’m planning to address with surgery in the future. In the meantime, I’m trying to improve nasal breathing while I sleep. I sometimes use nasal strips to enhance nostril openings and/or Flonase spray (using it sparingly). The blockage usually begins when I lay down to sleep, and it can feel like one nostril is deeply blocked.

Some nights, I can fall asleep and breathe freely through both nostrils, and I wake up without a dry mouth (so I know I didn’t mouth-breathe). Other nights, though, It feels like one nostril is blocked deep inside the nose (sides can alter). Tissue or nasal strips/Flonase don’t help. I’ve tried some YouTube “unclog your nose” techniques, but they haven’t really worked either. The only thing that seems to work is Afrin spray, but I know it’s only safe for short-term use (3–5 days max) because it can damage the nose if overused.

A few questions:

* What could cause this intermittent blockage in one nostril? Could it be the concha bullosa, the deviated septum, turbinate hypotrophy or something else?
* Could allergies cause this kind of pattern?
* Does the fact that Afrin spray helps indicate anything about the root cause?
* Are there safe, natural, or long-term remedies to help unclog a nostril? Would nasal saline rinses or steam inhalation help?

I’m curious what has worked for others experiencing similar issues.

1. The neck incision hurt the most and it's a sharp pain along my jaw line. I almost feel the pain at the bone rather the incision site. This is probably due to a nerve that runs along that area if I had to guess.

2. My tongue is SORE. I should've expected this, but I didn't think it would be soo sore. It is mainly an issue when eating and trying to move food from my cheek area with my tongue. 

3. I'm surprised that I have minimal bruising. I had some yellowish bruising appear on my chest, but quickly resolved. Also, the bottom of my tongue was bruised for 1 day.

4. I'm soo tired. I didn't think I would be soo tired during my recovery, but all I want to do is sleep. I've had several other surgeries in the past and this by far has made me the most tired. But hey, rest is important for recovery!

5. Swallowing is uncomfortable. Like my throat is not sore, but the back of my sore is sore and feels a little bulkiers? I think that's swelling. I'm guessing the mild discomfort with Swallowing will go away as my body gets used to the wires at the hypoglossal nerve.

I’m considering switching to Breathe Right Extra Strength. From the descriptions, both Original and Extra Strength are made of ""tan, breathable, form-fitting material that stays in place"" so I’m curious:

* Will the Extra Strength strips likely stay on better for me?
* Are there any risks with the stronger adhesive, or is it pretty much the same in terms of safety and ""toxicity""?

Also, I’m wondering if there are better alternatives to nasal strips, ideally something that:

* Avoids adhesive so I don’t have sticky residue in the morning,
* Still expands the nostrils effectively (similar to what a Cottle maneuver achieves),
* Preferably more natural or reusable.

I’ve heard about internal nasal dilators and some magnetic nasal devices, but I’m not sure which ones are comfortable or effective.

Has anyone tried Extra Strength strips or any non-adhesive alternatives that really work? How do they compare in terms of comfort, effectiveness, and morning cleanup?

Thanks in advance for any advice!",1765591277.0,4,8,SleepApnea,sleep

My doctor said to lose weight and try a saline spray and that a cpap is not clinically indicated. I am on a weight loss journey but still have a lot to go and I think getting better sleep would def help. I am so frustrated bcus she originally gave me a week trial run with a cpap and it significantly helped me. I am so exhausted all the time and just want better sleep 😭

1pl8liy,Help with my diagnosis (Questions),"Hi, I’m 58/f. Just got my sleep study results back (I did an at home test) and  I have a few questions. I posted the results of my test. 

Has anyone else had results similar to mine and treated it with a C-pap unit? Did it improve the way you felt? 

I do have mild symptoms-I’m obese, and I have pretty bad Nocturia, waking anywhere from 3-5 times a night to pee (I am Pre-diabetic) and from what I’ve read, Nocturia could be a sleep apnea symptom. I only occasionally have the daytime fatigue, and I’m typically up by 8, wide awake and feeling okay. Don’t typically wake with headaches. 

I’m not sure how they picked up the positional part since I did this at home. I’m a side sleeper only, and can’t sleep at all on my back. I’m thinking I must somehow roll onto my back in my sleep and snore, and that’s where they picked up the positional part. 

My husband’s sleep apnea score was a bit over 5 a few years ago when he did his at home test, and he still qualified for the cpap and has been using it ever since. 

Just curious what other people think about this, thanks. ",1765587950.0,3,2,SleepApnea,sleep

1pkzzce,Just diagnosed and feeling such relief,"Hi everyone! I'm brand-new to this subreddit and just wanted to vent my feelings since I was just diagnosed today with mild-moderate sleep apnea. 

I have struggled with feeling constantly exhausted since I was 7 years old; diagnosed with severe depression at 13 and treated with max doses of antidepressants that didn't help; dropped out of school at 16; prescribed sleeping meds at 21 and just two months ago, had them raised to the maximum dose; gave up my full-time position for a casual one since working full-time was killing me; 4-year relationship with the love of my life beginning to fall apart because I find no joy or pleasure in anything and can barely function.

All throughout my life, I've been certain there was more to it than depression, but every test came back normal. Thyroid, vitamins, lupus testing, everything comes back normal. Nothing explains my exhaustion, my body aches, my severe and seemingly untreatable depression. 

I went in for sleep testing, and today I received the call diagnosing me with mild-moderate sleep apnea. Finally, as I'm about to turn 27, I have a diagnosis. I feel so relieved, I can't even explain it. It feels so validating, and FINALLY, I'm feeling some hope for the future. I go in January to be fitted for a CPAP and this is the first treatment I actually feel hopeful about. 

I've gotten so sick of trying different antidepressants, upping doses, adding in other ones, talking to psychiatrists and therapists, all to end up with very little to no improvement in my symptoms. I started to feel like maybe this is just the way that I am and that I'll always be. 

But finally, I feel hope.

1pkz0lx,Mixed instructions from doctors,"2019 was diagnosed with moderate sleep apnea at 23 years old very fit male (AHI 18.4), assigned a cpap machine. I started using it religiously for 2 years before the Philips recall in 2021. Used off/on for a few years before they sent a replacement. By that point noticed it didn’t seem to make a difference when I was using it or not — felt like crap either way. Had gained about 40 lbs, felt horrible. New doctor ordered a new sleep study in 2025, results showed no sleep disorders (AHI 2.2). WTF. Same clinic, same test procedure, same lab, same everything.

… now I can’t get a straight answer for whether I need this machine or not, or if sleep apnea is even my problem. My PCP seemed totally nonplussed that I would be diagnosed NO sleep apnea five years later and 40 lbs heavier after being diagnosed as a young skinny boy, and didn’t care to investigate other potential problems. Was referred BACK to sleep clinic who basically shrugged their shoulders. I have many classic symptoms associated with sleep apnea, exhausted in the morning, headaches, fatigue, anxiety, irritable, frequent urination, general malaise. Less common but most frustrating I’ve gone from a super competitive long distance athlete to really struggling with exercise and packing on weight like crazy.

1pkxw3j,Sunosi Prior Auth Denied????,"I was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea in July or August of this year. My sleep study showed I had 63 apneic/hypopneic episodes an hour.

Sunosi is on my insurance formulary but requires a prior authorization and has a quantity limit (1 a day). My PCP put in a prescription for 75mg once a day (which is compliant with my insurance rules). But I just found out the prior authorization was denied. 

My PCP is not the best when it comes to paperwork and prior authorizations. So I have a feeling he left out important information (like mentioning I am seeing a sleep doctor and I am compliant with my CPAP).

1pkvyqt,I’m confused about what happened during my sleep study.,"I had my second sleep study last night into today. My first was for diagnostic purposes and this one was split night, but I didn’t know it was a split night study and not a full night study until yesterday. There were some communication issues when I scheduled this sleep study which is why I wasn’t aware of this till I showed up. Last year I was diagnosed with central sleep apnea that bordered on severe according to my results, and this sleep study was meant to see how CPAP may affect me. I was under the impression that the CPAP would be placed on me just before laying down to sleep, but right before she left the room for the night, the tech told me that this wasn’t the case and that she would come into the room to apply the CPAP if I needed it, in her exact words. A wave of anxiety immediately came over me, because I was scared that somehow my brain would choose to function correctly leading to no CPAP, and then my diagnosis would be revoked. I’m terrified of this because if that is the case, it means I’d be starting from square one with trying to figure out what is causing my symptoms, and it would put me even further away from getting any kind of treatment. I know this sounds dramatic, but right now the thought of being told that I don’t actually have central sleep apnea nearly has me in tears. Just to clarify, the tech didn’t give me any information about what she observed during the night, it’s just the fact that I was told I’d be put on CPAP “if I needed it”, then not being put on CPAP that is making me anxious.

I had a hard time going to sleep and I don’t know how much that may have contributed. I must have lied awake for and hour in a half in the beginning, and I woke up about 3 times during the night. My only hope is that I just wasn’t asleep long enough to complete the tritation.

I’m sorry if this post is a mess, I’m just dealing with the mental fog of having not sleep very long or well. I also don’t know if all of this is just my anxiety talking or if it’s all justified.",1765556274.0,2,3,SleepApnea,sleep

1pkkzht,Higher AHI with CPAP than without – normal during first days?,"Hi everyone,

I’m on my 3rd night with CPAP (Prisma Smart Max) and I’m a bit worried.

Before CPAP my AHI was ~22/h.
With the machine, it’s worse: last night AHI 31/h over ~5 hours, with 0 leaks.

Settings:
	•	Min pressure now 5 cmH₂O (was 4)
	•	Max pressure 14 cmH₂O
	•	No humidifier
	•	Nasal mask
	•	SoftPAP level 2

I struggle a lot with exhaling against the pressure, dry nose/throat, poor sleep and fatigue.

Is it normal to have higher AHI at the beginning?
Could this be pressure-related or treatment-emergent central apneas?

Any advice appreciated. Thanks 🙏",1765520967.0,3,16,SleepApnea,sleep
1pkjwp0,"My throat closes and I stop breathing unless I lay on my stomach, even with CPAP??","Okay so context is that I was dx with acute sleep apnea at age 11, wore a cpap till age 18. At 18 the sleep study showed no apnea and so I stopped wearing it. But sometime in my teens I noticed that when I try to sleep on my back or side, my throat closes up and I choke. If I drift off it will wake me up because I am suffocating on my own throat. The cpap, which I still have, does nothing for it. It’s very annoying because I have neck issues and they are made worse by always sleeping on my stomach but I am unable to sleep any other way.

1pkahag,I think I almost died that last two nights.,"I was diagnosed with mild OSA a few years ago after my doctor suggested a sleep study for chronic headaches. I tried a couple masks, but would sleep worse or wake up with the mask off my face, and cleaning the parts was annoying, so I gave up after several attempts. I didn't give it a lot of effort or take the issue very seriously. I'm not old, not obese, and have always been a poor sleeper, so don't really know what good sleep is supposed to feel like. I just assume everyone is always exhausted.

My spouse does complain about me not using the cpap and I had recently spoken to my doctor about giving it another shot, but I hadn't prioritized it.

The night before last, I was dreaming that my mouth was dried out and I couldn't get any air in. I was gasping, suffocating and barely getting the words ""help"" out of my mouth with the little air in my lungs. No one could understand that I could not breathe or help me. I was pouring liquids in my mouth and it wasn't helping open my throat so I could breathe. I finally woke up gasping and felt like I had not been breathing. My mouth was open and dried out. I drank all the water from my bottle, and spent several minutes catching my breath while I tried to process the feeling that I almost died and no one could help me. I wasn't sure if I could have actually died, but I felt like it almost happened. 

After all that trauma, I decided I have no choice but to try the cpap again, but didn't order a new mask yet.

Last night it happened again. Same thing. Stuck in my dream, not breathing, no one can help me. My spouse was asleep on the couch
couch (worked late,) so if I was making noise, he wasn't hearing it. 

IS THIS WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME ALL THE TIME? IS THIS WHY MY MENTAL HEALTH IS IN THE GUTTER AND I FEEL LIKE TRASH ALL THE TIME??? WTH? ...That was rhetorical. I already know the answer. I just didn't want to believe I really need a machine to function. 

I also now realize my recurring dreams of plunging off a bridge and drowning I have had for the last decade might be related to the OSA. Good news is, maybe I dont die that way! Maybe I die in my sleep instead!? (Hopefully when I am a lot older though, not right now.)

So after my second near death awakening in two days, I am just here to say, WEAR THE STUPID ANNOYING MASK! YOU ARE GOING TO DIE YOU STUPID IDIOT!! Mostly to myself, but also to anyone else making irresponsible decisions about their health when the solution is within their reach. A lot of people aren't that priviledged.

1pkaa3m,At home sleep test,"At my annual physical I told my doctor that I am tired a lot despite getting plenty of sleep (I sleep 7-9 hours every night, sometimes 10+ on the weekends - I even set alarms for the weekend because I rarely wake naturally). I have kind of always been this way but as I get older it is worse. I get plenty of sleep hours and it doesn't ""feel"" restless usually but no matter  how many hours I cannot wake up and find it so hard to get out of bed. I also feel tired during the day but not to a point where I am literally falling asleep doing normal stuff.

The thing is I do not snore at all according to my husband though I do have pretty bad sinus/nasal issues which cause me to mouth breathe often. (my  nose is stuffy and I wake up with a dry mouth and a headache)

Anyway I did a home study, obviously that night my nasal passages were perfectly clear! lol. But the doctor messaged me and said your home study doesn't show signs of apnea but if you want you can do a lab test.

Now a lab test sounds a lot more invasive and makes me think more like.. ok am I being dramatic, isn't everyone tired. And again, I do not snore at all. My husband has pretty bad apnea and his snoring is INSANE if he's not using the cpap.

Just wondering should I still do the lab study or given a clear home study, not a snorer, not actually falling asleep at the wheel of the car or anything, is it most likely I just am a normal person who is tired a lot for regular reasons?

Rant paused.  So my question is for a mask for someone like me. I am a nose breather with clenched jaw that sleeps on my side and fairly active.  I have an Asian nose bridge (relevant bc I think this makes the F&P solo leak) and BMI 26 (relevant bc rep said losing 30 lbs would help and I said I’m looking to lose some to look better in a bathing suit but not interested in heroin chic).

The Fisher Payne’s solo feels great but when I move it bursts me with air.  I’d love to find something like it with a better fit.

1pk6di6,Interesting data point,"I don’t know if I have sleep apnea but I have been having health issues for 2 years and all of my symptoms are listed as symptoms that could be related to sleep apnea. 

My O2 ring shows that my blood oxygen dips below 94% at night (although it does that during the day too) and in the high 80s. I assume there is an apnea problem,central or obstructive I don’t know yet. The xray of my chest is clear aside from some minor scarring presumed to be from an old infection.

Over 50% of my sleep time has been below 94% blood oxygen for the week I am measured. 

Anyhow, I wore a mouth guard 2 night ago, a bulky uncomfortable mouth guard and  that was the only night only 25% of the time was spent under 94% blood oxygen.

I did not notice any difference in my sleep pattern aside from the same 1 hour of smooth oxygen level just like the first day with the other mouthguard. But my mouthguard was set to neutral so no jaw advancement. Overall the quality if sleep was worse but I also had a lot to drink that evening. My HR was a little under 90 bpm all night so I don’t think this was a good reference night for the mouthguard. 

I am still intrigued by that hour of smooth oxygen intake because it only has happened ld while wearing mouthguards. i just need to figure out what causes that and then I need to extend it to the whole night. I am thinking of setting up a camera and record myself sleeping.

His doctor was useless. She just said he isn’t using it enough, he told her the issue, and she said “you might just need more pressure”. That was it, no guidance. We are working on finding him a whole new medical network because all of them he sees right now have been awful in general, but I digress. 

He’s tried both the nose only mask and the full nose/mouth mask. He keeps saying he feels like he can’t take a deep breath in with it on. He’s had congestion issues so he’s taking a decongestant now and I’m getting him back on allergy pills. He’s from FL and has only lived here close to 18 months, so I don’t think he realized that he can end up with different allergies based on region. I personally have indoor and outdoor allergies, so I have to take meds all year. 

I know the CPAP has the water in it but we have put on a humidifier at night to see if that helps (it helps me at least). He’s only using it for maybe 2 hours a night at this point because he ends up ripping it off and waking up without it on. I tend to be awake later and playing on my phone, so I’ve been awake to see this happening. I also had access to the app linked to his CPAP. 

When he was tested, he was having something like 30 events per hour. He’s overweight at 270lbs and 6ft but they said the circumference of his neck makes him more susceptible. His mom had sleep apnea also. I’m concerned about him not using it enough. He wants to use it but is so frustrated with it and feeling suffocated. 


Do you think a different doctor can help? I don’t fully understand the pressure settings so it’s hard to see if any of that changes things. I’m able to access those settings. Right now it’s set to a range of 4-20 that ramps up from 4 (sorry I don’t know the measurement, just the numbers).

Just got my Air-sense 11 this week and the first night was horrible. I have the full face mask as I tend to breathe through my mouth when asleep. I tried it an hour before I sleep as other posts had recommended but could not fall asleep for 3-3.5 hours. Then finally tired and irritated I removed the mask and slept normally. I got to 1.8 events but that’s because I never slept.

I talked to the doctor and he mentioned the pressure and other settings are set by them and I cannot change it. Only thing I can change is the ramp and climate control settings.

1pjwh1a,UPDATE: redditors help me find out i have allergies instead of sleep apnea,"A while ago I posted my sleep apnea results on here to see if a CPAP would be helpful. My fear is that I won't adhere to using the CPAP or it be uncomfortable for me to sleep through the night. 

The top 2 comments suggested there's sign of hyponeas or RERAS. I did a little more digging on the thread and somebody mentioned in the UK it's standard procedure to go to the ENT to check your airways. I scheduled an appt to check just to make sure my airway is clear and it's not the anatomical structure of my nose that's causing me breathing problem.

Guess what? It IS MY NOSE that's been the problem. I didn't even know i have serious allergies to the point where my turbinates were very swollen and cause major congestion. For example, if regular nose is like a boba straw, my nose airways is the size of a regular straw. I've been mouth breathing my whole life to compensate so i didn't even notice it was a thing. Although i do recall waking up with thick mucus and congestion  in nose but i thought it was because my room was too cold. 

Dr put my on steroid spray everyday twice a day. It's only been week 2 and i was able to sleep for more than 4 hours and actually woke up feeling refresh. I can feel the air (instead of mucus) coming out of my nose now whenever i woke up first thing in the morning.

I also prop up my pillow, sleep on my side and do myofunctional facial exercise as some ENT on youtube recommended. It doesn't cost me anything so I thought why not give it a try (I'm desparate to fix my sleep at this point) . I can't tell you its effectiveness yet, i'm pretty sure the steroid spray does most of the heavy lifting. Maybe it's a combination of everything and I can finally sleep now and doesn't feel as depressed anymore.

1pjus92,2 months on CPAP: Waking up hot at 3-4 AM with intense dreams. Still feeling tired.,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been using my CPAP machine for about a month and a half (almost two months) now. I’m finally reaching the point where I can sleep through the entire night with the mask on.

However, I have a specific issue: I keep waking up at almost the exact same time every night (around 3 or 4 AM). When I wake up, I feel really hot, and it always happens right after a period of extremely intense dreaming. I feel like I’ve done nothing but dream since I started my therapy.

I’ve read that this (REM rebound) is normal and supposedly a ""good sign,"" but frankly, it is exhausting me. I don’t feel like I’m getting better quality sleep, and I don't feel any more rested than before.

**I wanted to ask the community:**

* Has anyone else experienced this specific waking up/overheating pattern?
* How long did it take for you to get used to it and for the crazy dreams to settle down?
* When did you actually start feeling rested?

Any advice would be appreciated!

*Ps: 23Yo, 80Kg, AHI 55.*  
*Just goes to show that anyone can be affected by this. I invite anyone who feels constantly tired to go consult a sleep center!*",1765450874.0,3,7,SleepApnea,sleep
1pjullx,First night with CPAP,"Hey, 

I posted a while back asking how things would go after finally getting my machine and let me tell you….

Nor what I was expecting. 
The lady that handed me the machine yesterday was extremely nice and knowledgeable, trying every possible mask, making me toss and turn while lying down to check for leakage and all around being very reassuring and nice.

So I went home with my Airsense 11 and an N30i mask.

I was a little excited about going to bed with the thing last night and went about my regular nightly routine, brush teeth, doomscroll a bit on reddit and then put on my headband (with headphones for something to listen to while falling asleep) and my mask.
Snort into the mask like she told me to to get the machine activated so-to-speak and laid down.
Around 30ish minutes later I was asleep but sadly got woken up by my gf coming to bed another 30ish minutes after that. Put on a new video to listen to and went back to sleep.
About 4 hours later I wake up having to pee, but it felt like I just had to instead of just going because I was awake already.
After that I could not get the machine to cooperate anymore. No amount of snorting into the mask made the machine reawaken. Only using the big on/off button at the top made it go again.
Slept another 3 hours with it on, occasionally readjusting for any leakage or uncomfortable feelings.

In total the machine says I‘ve used it 9 hours and had an amazing fit on the mask. But I feel incredibly anxious today. Like I haven’t slept at all and something horrible is about to happen. I have not felt this anxious in a while.
I was hoping I would wake up a little more refreshed than I had been for the last 10-15 years but instead I feel like running away and quitting again.
Today is my gfs birthday and we are going out to Dinner tonight. I sure hope my body settles down by then ans gets out of this whole fight or flight crap.",1765450185.0,14,24,SleepApnea,sleep

1pjiqe5,Alpha intrusions during Rem sleep?,"So I finally got my ASV titration study results and it showed 2 interesting findings. 

One:  I apparently experience alpha waves during rem sleep. I never get to REM sleep stage so the ASV machine must have helped me.

 Does anyone know anything about this alpha waves during rem sleep? 

And Two: I also experienced REM without Atonia. 

A quick Google search says Rem without Atonia means...

 REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) means your brain is in REM sleep (dreaming), but your muscles aren't temporarily paralyzed; instead, they show increased tone or activity, which can manifest as talking, punching, or kicking, and is a hallmark of REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD), a precursor to neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's. It's diagnosed via polysomnography (sleep study) and can be linked to brainstem issues, certain medications (like antidepressants), or other neurological conditions, serving as a vital biomarker for future neurological decline. 

With all of the sleep studies I have had throughout my life I have never had these 2 findings. Thoughts?",1765411048.0,4,2,SleepApnea,sleep
1pjhvcx,"Inspire Experience, this is NOT a paid testimonial.  It's my real experience.","I'd like to share my experience with Inspire, which was implanted in July 2025.  I also want to share that my experience could be unique, and uncommon, but I'd like to share nonetheless because deciding to have a foreign object put into your body with a significant surgery is something to think seriously about, with all data and exposure to all reviews and experiences.  In retrospect, I should have relied less on youtube reviews, and demanded live references, many of them.  

Following the surgery in July, the recommended pulmonary facility that works with post operative activation was a time-consuming disaster and the ENT that did the surgery was little help.  Just know that once the surgery is done, your ENT is out of the picture unless there are medical complications.  There is no direct Inspire support, at least none was provided to me.  Anyhow, activation was expected to happen a few weeks after the implant procedure.  Scheduling the activation was a series of unreturned phone calls from both ENT and pulmonary facility, wasted hours making phone calls trying to schedule activation, and botched coordinated communication with ENT, the Inspire rep, who must attend each activation and adjustment session.  Finally, after 3 months of attempting to get the damn thing activated, I was finally successful, albeit months of frustration and lost time.

Once activated, I can share that the tongue movement is jarring, and unnatural.  Think about that.  By design, it does move the tongue, but just know it's weird, takes time to get used to, and it does take time to find the right setting, with additional visits to the the facility, equally hard to schedule.  It took about three visits and adjustments to get the thing to operate at a level that was commensurate with my tolerance, while trying to be effective.

For the past two or so months I've been consistent each night activating the device.  It is weird because the intensity of the shock varies, despite being on a single level.  I'm not sure if this is normal, or if my device is defective?  Nonetheless, I have not experienced a balanced, consistent shock and the variability does wake me up, and makes it difficult to tolerate.  

If you tend to be a sleeper that wakes up multiple times in the night, be prepared that you will need to put the device on pause, and then you have a window of falling back to sleep, but if you do not, the device kicks on, and it is pretty much impossible to go back to sleep, so you have to cycle through the pause timeline many times, hoping to return to sleep before being awakened by the device once it kicks on.  This has actually cause me less sleep, than more restful sleep as I do wake up a few times.  So, be prepared for that.  Often, I just get exhausted with the cycles and turn it off entirely.  Not many people discuss this in reviews, but it's a thing.

Does Inspire stop snoring?  For me, no.  Therefore, I continue to wear my CPAP so my partner can rest.  Yes, I'm still wearing my CPAP, Inspire did not replace this for my case.  I can share that my partner does state that my breathing gaps have improved, but my snoring has not, hence the CPAP, which is not a 100% fix for me, never has been.

I live in Austin, Texas and the Inspire folks seem very disorganized, hurried, and they are not accessible for issues.  I have contacted the main support line because the Austin team is such a mess, and this was moderately helpful, but not terrific.  

With each activation/adjustment session, the Inspire reps must accompany the pulmonary doctor adding to the scheduling challenges.  They have limited availability and this is problematic.  I had an appointment today to adjust and review my usage and levels, but the Inspire rep did not show up, I was not contacted, he just didn't show up.  I took more time off of work for the appointment, and was sorry to see that the Inspire experience continues to decline for me due to the no show.

Where to from here?...Now that I have this damn thing in my body, and after a moderately serious surgery, I am inclined to continue trying to make this work as I feel I have no other choice.  I will give Inspire a few more months, but if my APNEA and snoring do not improve, I will move toward total extraction and get this damn thing out of my body.

Maybe the Inspire infrastructure, reps and organization are better where you reside?  Perhaps you will have better coordination between your ENT, Inspire and a pulmonary facility?  And, perhaps you will have better results from the implant than I have experienced?  I do see positive reviews and I did my own limited research of the reviews and testimonials pre surgery, but I suspect many reviews were very orchestrated, paid for by Inspire or simply, untrue.  

It is a big decision to make having something put into your body.  I would really encourage all those considering Inspire to actually think about the time this requires, and how odd the physical sensation is with your tongue involuntarily jutting out of your mouth while trying to sleep. Do your research on your ENT and make sure there is a good handoff from Dr to Inspire to pulmonary facility.  I have had the worst experience and do not think the Austin Inspire team is set up properly to truly care for patients.  These things are expensive, and Inspire is making a lot of money at the expense of patients experiencing their dysfunction and improper set up, unprofessional standards and missed appointments.  

All that suffer from APNEA for years are eagerly open to anything that proposes a solution.  I fell into this trap, hopeful this was a great solution.  It has not been for me.  I wish all much better support, and results if you choose to put this thing in your body.

1pj6cnh,First night on CPAP (prisma SMART max) – only managed 2 hours. Is this normal?,"Hey everyone 👋

Last night was my very first night using CPAP (prisma SMART max with a nasal mask), and I wanted to share how it went to see if others had a similar experience.

I only managed to keep the machine on for a little over 2 hours. After that, I couldn’t continue. I had:
	•	a feeling that I sometimes had to “force” my breathing,
	•	a pretty dry nose,
	•	an odd sensation from the airflow,
	•	and some trouble fully relaxing with the mask on.

The app showed an AHI of 12, but I’m pretty sure that’s from me testing the mask before actually going to bed — it already showed 12 events before I even started sleeping 😅

On the positive side, I had 0 leaks (0 L/min), so the mask fit seems good. And my overall sleep (without CPAP) was decent: almost 8 hours in total, low heart rate, good HRV. So the short CPAP session didn’t seem to mess up my night too much.

My question is: Is it normal to only tolerate CPAP for 2 hours on the first night?
Did you also experience things like a dry nose or feeling like you had to work harder to breathe?
How many nights did it take before you could keep the mask on for several hours?

1pj3a2f,any tips for pre-diagnosis?,"I'm not looking for a diagnosis, I already have a doctors appointment booked to find that out, I'm just curious if anyone has any insight or advice.

I've been told by multiple people that I snore like a lawnmower/chainsaw/I 'snork' but I don't 'mimimi'. I always believed them, but never really looked into it, I just apologised profusely. I also always wake up dehydrated, and have a lot of tension/temple headaches. Recently I started using nose strips which my housemate (who used to be able to hear me in her room!) has said helped quite a lot with the volume of the snoring.

However I recently downloaded a sleep recording tracking and recorded a night of sleep, and GEEZ. My snoring is truly horrendous, I sound exactly like a revving chainsaw, it's hard to believe its even a person making the noise, and its constant almost as soon as I fall asleep. I can't even imagine how it was before my housemate said it dramatically improved with the nose strips. My disturbance score was 38/h, which I've gathered from this subreddit is very high, and may indicate severe sleep apnea? Although I understand an app on my phone sitting on the side table isn't going to be 100% accurate. 

Does anyone have any tips to improve this at all even a tiny bit between now and a diagnosis? I imagine its going to be a relatively lengthy process to get a diagnosis (and probably a CPAP), since I'm relying on the NHS, and seeing the results from the app is concerning and a bit scary and makes me want to try and fix things a bit in the meantime. I'm 26 f, and to be completely candid, I am overweight (and have been struggling to loose weight, even on a strict diet and weight loss injections, which I hear is also a side effect of sleep apnea!)

As someone with bad anxiety, any tips to provide even a tiny bit of relief would be great. I already use nose strips, I sleep on my side/stomach, and I am going to be trying to elevate the head of my bed with some sofa cushions under the mattress tonight to prop myself up. I also know weight loss helps, and I am working on that atm (lost 2 stone so far).

It's also worth noting that I don't have a lot of money, so buying things to help beyond the nose strips I already get isn't really an option for me.

1pivngz,"30+ years of fragmented sleep, sinus problems, nighttime asthma… and recent improvement with Daridorexant","# 30+ years of fragmented sleep, sinus problems, nighttime asthma… and recent improvement with Daridorexant

Hi everyone,

I live in East Asia and I’ve been dealing with sleep problems for more than 30 years — probably since high school when my sinus issues first began.

Back then I already had chronic:

* allergic rhinitis
* sinusitis
* constant runny nose
* headaches
* and very poor sleep

Things never fully resolved and over the decades it turned into a long-term, life-shaping problem.



**My worst period: waking up at 2–3 AM with headaches**

For many years, I woke up almost **every night around 2–3 AM**, usually with a headache or tightness around my temples.

After staying awake for a while I *could* fall asleep again, but the whole night was extremely fragmented.

The fragmentation became so severe that I eventually developed a kind of **fear of sleep** — I was afraid of going to bed because I knew I would wake up in the middle of the night again.

So I began forcing myself to stay awake until I was *completely exhausted* before going to bed.

This obviously made everything worse.



# Cognitive impact — the part that really scares me

Over the years my:

* memory
* attention
* and executive function

have all taken noticeable hits.

Some days I feel mentally sharp, and other days my brain just “shuts down” in complex situations.

This terrifies me because my mother developed dementia, and I’m scared I might follow the same path if my sleep doesn’t improve.

# Sinus surgery helped but didn’t solve everything

About 10 years ago I had a balloon sinuplasty for frontal sinusitis.

It worked very well — the frontal headaches disappeared.

But my **left temporal headaches** continued, and the nighttime asthma kept waking me up.

So the surgery helped, but it wasn’t the full solution.

# Trying CPAP (ResMed)

I eventually bought a ResMed CPAP machine.

It helped with breathing and stopped the choking events, but even with CPAP:

I was still only sleeping **3–4 hours** a night.

The 2–3 AM awakenings continued.

My sleep remained shallow and fragmented.

# Recently I tried Daridorexant

This is the first time in many years that something made a **real difference**.

With Daridorexant:

* I can sleep until **5–6 AM** (amazing for me)
* very few nighttime awakenings
* almost no asthma-triggered arousals
* the night feels calmer and more stable
* the sleep fragmentation has decreased noticeably

It seems that there is too many dreams in the night,but the Autosleep APP(apple watch) monitor results is much better than before,Deepsleep time more than 2 hours, I could only sleep for about 30-40min deepsleep before.

# About the dosage:

* **50 mg is too much** → I feel mentally foggy the next day
* **25 mg is about right** → I sleep longer but stay functional during the day

It’s not perfect, but compared to the last 30 years, this feels like major progress.

# Why I’m posting

If anyone else here has:

* long-term sinus problems
* allergic rhinitis
* nighttime asthma
* chronic early awakenings
* CPAP but still poor sleep
* cognitive symptoms from years of sleep fragmentation
* fear of sleep
* or is experimenting with Daridorexant

I would really appreciate hearing your stories.

I also want to know if anyone else worries about long-term cognitive decline after so many years of poor sleep.

I got to take the pressure bandage off and look at the incisions. I have two: one at the right jaw and one above the right greasy.

I have notice my tongue being super sore and noticed they cut my tongue tie. I am guessing that will help with allowing my tongue moving forward when the device is active.

I left the house today to go out to eat with my husband. It wasn't too bad by my jaw incision hurts the most. Most of the pain is controlled with Tylenol. However, I have taken a few of the Oxy pills since surgery as the pain sometimes jumps to an 8. The Oxy doesn't take away all of the pain, but it brings it down to a 2 and then it can be controlled with Tylenol.

Sleep has been rough with waking up every 2 hours. Not necessarily due to pain, but I think it is due to general discomfort.

I bought a sling and I were it when I'm moving around a lot which takes pressure off of the chest incision. Some ENTs will send you home with one, while others don't.

At the 48 hour mark, I will be allowed to shower and can get the incisions wet, but no scrubbing.

Is this normal or should I go see someone about it?,"We live in a dorm, bigger than a traditional dorm but obviously still shared living spaces. They're already not a good sleeper, so they're up in the middle of the night while I am still sleeping. They say that it isn't loud snoring, and it doesn't disturb them when they go to sleep. Throughout the night I apparently snore for a few minutes and then stop for awhile (an hourish?) and then I might start again. 

  
My mom has sleep apnea. I asked her about it and she said its normal, my roommate keeps insisting I do. One of the symptoms I see when I search them up is being tired in the day, but I feel fine unless I didn't sleep well, and I have low iron so I'm always a baseline of tired.

Lately if I do wake up during the night and go back to sleep, my heart rate jumps to the 90 - 110 range, waking me up. I have one of those finger pulse ox measurement takers. My resting rate is usually anywhere from 80 to 95.

  
Pulse ox reads as 95-98 % but then I'm awake by then and breathing on my own so not sure if that means anything.

  
I'm thinking that in the middle of the night maybe I'm falling asleep too quickly, and my ramp time means that the pressure isn't enough to keep my airway open and I'm choking without noticing, but aside from the heart rate I don't feel unwell. 

Third time it's happened this week, before that, yes I do wake up at least once a night. I think that's a habit I just haven't broken where I just go use the toilet and go back to bed.

My machine just recorded 0.1 event per hour (anything up to 3 ahi is my usual) which is the confusing part. Mask seal reads as good.

1piajyi,New to this. Suggestions?,"Hi,
A bit of history:
During the pandemic I started smoking heavily and became more sedentary. I gained weight. Then, 2 years ago I started having elevated heart rate during the day (average used to be in the 60s before, now it was in the 90s). I also started waking up at night with palpitations and I would sweat profusely and feel nauseous. I decided to quit smoking and, after dealing with that, i was not waling up sweating and nauseous anymore. But I still had headache and heart rate random spikes. I have been since trying to look for a cause and wore holter monitors and did all sort if tests. They can’t figure out what’s happening.

My doc always asked me if I said but I said no. There was only one time, when ai was at my heaviest, that I remember i was snoring. Since the headaches are getting worse and are in the morning now, she ordered a sleep study which I scheduled the consultation for in April (yup, California’s healthcare times). 

So i bought an oximeter to wear at night. I was shocked to see that, first of all, that my blood oxygen is 95% during the day which just a few years back was consistently 98%. At night, it dips to 86-88%. I noticed that my heart rate spikes up but it is not regularly after my blood oxygen is at its lowest. But I think this finding may be the cause of all the issues I have been experiencing. 

I have been unable to lose weight. When I eat nothing i still plateau at 225 lbs and if I eat anything I hover at 235 lbs (were I am now). Then I read about sleep apnea and that it causes all sorts of problems including making it harder to lose weight. It’s all making sense but, i won’r know for sure until next summer when i get the sleep study done. 

So I ordered an online test that arrives today and will try to do tomorrow. The website says that if sleep apnea is diagnosed by one of their doctors the will wrote a script for a CPAP machine. I am not particularly enthusiastic about that but I would try anything at this point to get a night of sleep. I also bought a couple of mouth guards from Amazon that should get here today to try. 

If I do get a CPAP machine, I plan it to use it for few weeks to interrupt the cycle and hopefully be able to lose weight and exercise again. Is my thinking correct or a CPAP is something I would need the rest of my life?

I am going to attach screenshots of my O2. Does that look like sleep apnea to you? I ll also list sone if the issues I have been having which I looked up and all are relatable to sleep apnea (although it could be a lot of other things too). 

Thank you for the help.

1pi4mo3,MAD Trial - My Experience,"Hi folks,

I am coming to the end of my on-off trial of a mandibular advancement device (MAD), moving to a period of two months where I should wear it every night and I wanted to share my experience so far and some promising results. I will give my context and experience first and then dive in with some results.

**Context**

For context, I am a 30-year old guy who is probably of average build, exercises regularly and a bit taller than most. My main problem is my excessive snoring, waking up during the night, and some sleepiness which isn't usually a problem but my snoring can be heard from several rooms away.

I was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea with a ridiculously high AHI in August 2024. Sorry I can't be more precise with the 'ridiculously high', I don't have the letter to hand anymore. Following this, I went on a CPAP trial for three months and during that time I barely slept, I really struggled to get even a couple of hours sleep whilst using the machine. I persevered for all three months but in the end my consultant and I agreed it wasn't the right therapy.

Fast forwards to about a month ago I had a MAD mold taken, 2 weeks later the device was fit and adjusted. I was told to wear the device on Mon, Wed, Fri for 3 weeks and then start wearing it permanently.

**Experience of MAD**

The device itself is a two-piece tight-fitting mouth piece with a metal plate behind/on-top of my bottom front teeth and a metallic hook hanging from the upper plate. The hook 'catches' the bottom plate keeping my jaw forwards. (Saying hook makes it sound way worse than it actually is!

Wearing the device at first was a bit odd, the orthodontist told me to wear it for an hour a day before the 'trial' started (I received the device on a Friday and started the 'trial' on the following Monday). This could not have been better advice. When I started wearing it I learnt very quickly that the device was so much more comfortable than any off-the-shelf solutions and whilst it did feel weird to begin with I got used to it very quickly.

It wasn't all sunshine and roses though, the first 2/3 nights of wearing it I found I dribbled in my sleep which wasn't ideal to wake up to and in the mornings my jaw felt stiff (not painful, just stiff). However, these symptoms faded very quickly. Now I wake up, have a shower and the feeling is gone.

In terms of maintenance, I clean the device each morning when I clean my teeth (using a different toothbrush and soap not toothpaste as was advised).

I have felt no other side effects.

**Early Results**

Initially I found I wake-up less frequently during the nights in which I wear the device and I don't know if this is just circumstance but I don't get my usual dreams in which I am falling over (waking up) or drowning which is mentally amazing.

Last week I felt brave enough to pick up my Fitbit and try wearing it again to see if I could notice any difference. (For context, I used to wear a Fitbit but it never recorded my sleep properly and the SpO2 graphs would be pointless to look at as they were mostly empty or varied soo much it was too anxiety inducing to look at). So for the past week I have been charting my SpO2 every morning (after nights with and without the MAD).

I tend to go to bed at 21:00-22:00 and will usually fall asleep between 22:00-23:00, I set my alarm to 07:00 but generally I wake up anytime between 06:30-07:30.

Below are the results, the red charts show nights without the MAD and the green charts show nights with the MAD. The dates can be read as the ""night of"", e.g. the top left chart shows the ""night of"" the 30-11-2025.

[SpO2 readings for the nights with and without the MAD device.](https://preview.redd.it/xdjxn1y6g56g1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=949b876bff429c165f61adf3658cac51dd612276)

I thought after doing the first couple of nights that the charts were just a fluke or I was biasing the results subconsciously but I have intentionally done nothing out of the norm to mitigate any bias. This has included keeping my diet fairly normal (no takeaways or late night eating but also not being unusually healthy), exercising as normal and going to bed at my normal times. Unfortunately I can't control when I fall asleep which has caused some fluctuation.

Despite all of this, I have to say I am pleasantly surprised by the results, the differences between the nights with MAD and without are consistent. Whilst there is still room for improvement the fact the Fitbit can actually tell when I'm asleep now says a lot! For those of you who are Fitbit savvy it's the first time I've ever seen a Fitbit sleep score above 75 (averaging 92 a night with the MAD). Whilst I accept Fitbit tracking is not medically accurate, the disparity between nights with and without is pretty significant.

**Conclusion**

I am very happy with the results so far wearing the MAD, although I fully accept a lot of this testimonial is based on my experience and Fitbit tracking. However, with the noticeable symptom relief (especially the lack of waking up and dreams forcing me to wake up) and somewhat quantifiable evidence it is working I am really excited to start the next phase of the trial. I now have two months of wearing the device 'as much as possible' during the night and hopefully I will start to notice some long-term effects.

My main aim in this post was to hopefully help reassure anyone who is uncertain or, like me, finds this whole thing anxiety inducing. I was very keen to get this out there as whilst the community here is amazing I find there is a lot of negativity about therapies related to sleep apnea.

I'm more than happy to answer any questions about my experience so far and going forwards.",1765278042.0,9,14,SleepApnea,sleep

1pi1d2a,I stopped snoring finally!,"I thought I’d share my experience with you guys in relation to snoring and finding ways to reduce it or stop it completely. I know most people snore because they are overweight and simply losing weight can help fix the problem but for me my weight wasn’t the issue as i am weighing at a healthy weight for my size and height.

I tried a lot of things like sleeping on my side, mouth tape, nasal dilators, nostril tape, magnesium tablets, etc.. and nothing worked. And then I came across mouth guards that keep your lower jaw in front of your top jaw to keep it from falling back whilst you sleep because when your neck and jaw muscles relax they narrow your windpipe thus creating the snoring sound.

Anyway there wasn’t much information online about mouth guards or actually reviews/videos from real people using it so at first I was skeptical. But might as well give it a try because it’s better than ending up on a CPAP machine.

I bought a product called SnoreMD. It’s very expensive (160$ AUD) praying that it would work and wouldn’t be another fail and to my surprise it did! And to know if it worked or not (as I live on my own) I downloaded the snore app on my phone that records my sleep and every night I had the mouth guard in I didn’t snore!! It takes time to get used to sleeping with it in your mouth but over time my body has been adjusting to the mouthguard. Now I know SnoreMD is expensive for most of us but I’m sure there’s cheaper mouth guards that work just as well!

So before you guys give up try an anti snoring mouth guard. It might be the solution your looking for 👍",1765265116.0,0,5,SleepApnea,sleep
1pi03ea,"Sleep study in June vs now with weight loss. This is improvement, right?","37F. I decided to ask for a sleep study because I was feeling a lot of sleepiness for a year or so. Wanted to see if it was sleep apnea from weight gain or just my psoriatic arthritis causing fatigue. It took forever to get an at home one, so by the time I did get one I wasn't having the symptoms like I was. My worst symptom was my head flinging back and passing out on my couch constantly. Also, my Samsung watch 7 was showing consistently lower oxygen levels during sleep.

During the first sleep study I was going through autonomic nervous system dysfunction due to a biologic I was on, which also caused a huge GERD flare for months. By the time I got the first sleep study, I had already lost 15lbs. I started at 185 and was 170 during the first study. The first study seems a bit skewed due to the time not being correct, I only slept 5 hours and the breathing light kept coming on when I was still awake due to my natural shallow breathing. The first test was with the Alice NightOne.

[First sleep study results](https://imgur.com/a/3hROJub)


I ended up with a sleep specialist after that. We tried CPAP, but I just couldn't do it, I have too many sensory issues with my face and air, I even have a hard time doing a cannula in the hospital. I also wasn't having any symptoms anymore and the side effects from the medication I was on were much better after a few months. My smartwatch was showing consistently higher oxygen levels during sleep too. I ended up losing more weight and I'm at 157lbs now. So my sleep specialist wanted another sleep study to see if things are truly better for me. I didn't want to wait months again and like doing things on my time due to my nightshift work, so I got a sleep study from Lofta with the Watchpat One.

1phnkch,Inspire Update - 8 Months Post-Insertion,"For those considering Inspire, just wanted to provide an update on my progress, now 8 months after surgery. 

Pre-op sleep study showed 32 episodes avg per hour, 56 episodes per hour during deep sleep. Blood oxygen was 78%.

Got the implant in April. Zero complications, easy recovery. Scarring is minimal now. No issues with the box or wiring.  

After turning it on a month later, I have used it probably 98% of the time. The calibration process has been a bit lengthy, but over three in-office visits, my Dr. and the Inspire rep were really good in tweaking my settings and guiding me to the ""right"" (for now) level (which is 1.9 for those in the know.) 

Just completed a second sleep study on Friday, and now I'm at 13 episodes avg per hour (anything under 15 is considered ""success"") and 24 episodes per hour during deep sleep. Importantly, my blood oxygen was consistent at 90%.

Even though my doctor is happy with that result, we're going to do a lab sleep study in February, where the techs can monitor and adjust the implant in real-time to find the absolute best setting. 

Random notes:

\~I have the implant set to start 45 minutes after I click it on, which is enough time to go to sleep about 90% of the time. 

\~It never wakes me up when it turns on. 

\~I still wake up about three times a night, usually 4-5 hours in, then a couple of times in the last three hours of an 8-hour sleep cycle. 

\~I still feel a bit tired during the day, but that's likely related to occasional insomnia when I do wake up at night. Working on that.

\~When I do wake up at night, I can hardly feel the pulses. In fact, sometimes, I have to focus on them to make sure they're happening. 

So, all in all, I'm very happy that I got the device. C-PAP just was not working at all for me. I know others rave about it, but Inspire is so much easier and, it appears, almost as effective.

I noticed that I wasn't sleeping well about one year ago and tried to medicate myself to sleep better (melatonin or unisom). One day in March, I got sick from overheating and then things really changed for me. GERD happened and I ignored it for a few months. I started getting headaches right after that. Eventually I went to the ER (3 times) thinking I was having a heart attack. On the third trip the doctor admitted me to the hospital for tests. I did a stress test and the heart was healthy. They ran an endoscopy down me and found that I had gastritis and GERD. Started meds protonix however they made my blood pressure go up so now just using OTC meds to help with GERD. Life style changes help alot (raised head while sleeping/diet changes/eating 3 hours before bed/etc). Did a sleep study about 2 months ago and had 25 AHI for mild sleep apnea. Started CPAP about 7 weeks ago and the improvements are slow but steady. My AHIs are usually 1 or less. My issue is I have tension headaches that start in the temple area and move to forehead to the top of the head daily and usually all day long.

1ph81aa,Concern about a possible 83% desaturation — artifact or real?,"Hi everyone,
I recently had a full polysomnography and something is worrying me a lot.
In the report, my lowest SpO2 is shown as 83%. Naturally, this scared me, so I contacted my sleep doctor.

She looked at the recording again and told me that the oximeter signal was slightly shifted, meaning the drop is most likely an artifact, not a real desaturation.
She said it is not urgent and not dangerous, but she also told me that it should still be “explored” (“à explorer”).

I am confused about what “to explore” means in this context.

Here are my questions:
	1.	Does “to explore” mean she thinks a real medical issue is present, or is it just standard protocol when the sensor isn’t reliable?
	2.	My SpO2 average is around 92%, and I have mild sleep apnea (AHI 6). Could this mild apnea cause real dips to the 80s?
	3.	On the curve, the lowest values appear at the same moment the signal clearly looks unstable. Does this confirm it’s a sensor issue?
	4.	The nasal cannula did move at some point, but the finger probe was taped and didn’t move. Can the signal still drift even if the probe stays in place?

The doctor reassured me, saying “nothing serious”, but I want to understand why a shifted signal can cause false drops and how common this is.

Thanks in advance for your explanations — I’m trying to calm my anxiety and understand the data properly.",1765185648.0,3,8,SleepApnea,sleep

1pgvckd,ESP was supposed to fix my sleep apnea - it made it worse,"I'll try to keep this as concise and fact-based as possible, so feel free to ask clarifying questions if needed.

It's been 9 months since I had ESP (Expansion Sphincter Pharyngoplasty) done, and not only have I not experienced the slightest improvement, but I now cannot even fall asleep without ASV. As I relax and start to fall asleep, there seems to be significant resistance during inhalation. My breathing becomes more shallow until I need a big corrective breath that wakes me up. I do not think this is central sleep apnea as this didn't happen before surgery. Sure, the quality of my sleep was terrible if I slept without ASV, but I could at least fall asleep. If feels like ESP somehow made the obstruction worse.

Has anyone had a similar experience? What do you think I should do next?



# OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT TIMELINE:

20/03/2023: Initial diagnosis - PSG L2. AHI 26.6  
22/06/2023: Bilateral turbinoplasty + septoplasty  
17/07/2023: Transoral biopsy of uvula lesion (probably pointless)  
07/09/2023 to 31/01/2024: CPAP (ResMed AirSense 10 AutoSet APAP)  
31/01/2024 to present: ASV (ResMed AirCurve 10 CS PaceWave). I had to switch to ASV due to treatment-emergent sleep apnea that didn't resolve on its own.  
12/03/2025: ESP surgery (surgeon predicted a 75% chance of success since he suspected lateral pharyngeal wall collapse as the main cause of obstruction)



# FAQs

**Have you seen your surgeon after surgery?**

Yes. I didn't raise any concerns at the time because I was still using ASV with good results and hadn't attempted to sleep without it.

**Have you done another sleep study after surgery?**

I'd like to, but how am I supposed to do a sleep study if I can't fall asleep?

**Any other relevant information?**

My surgeon noted that my epiglottis is V-shaped. He thought this was due to lateral pharyngeal wall collapse, but it's possible he was wrong and that epiglottic collapse is actually the main obstruction

**What my gut tells me:**

Enough guessing or sloppy diagnosis based on questionable techniques that cannot truly replicate what causes sleep apnea. I think a DISE (drug-induced sleep endoscopy) is the best next step to properly identify what is actually causing my sleep apnea.

1pgva4f,Unsuccessful first night with a pillow mask -- what went wrong?,"I was diagnosed with moderate sleep apnea, and my doctor ordered me a ResMed AirSense 11. I was trained to use it on Friday, and the instructor showed a few different mask options. I chose the pillow mask to start, because it seemed less cumbersome, therefore less likely to disrupt my sleep rather than help it get better. 

I didn't get far with the pillow mask. While I was awake, it was fine. But I'm a mouth breather, which among other things means I'm constantly thirsty. And every time I nodded off, I opened my mouth and was awakened by blasts of air. 

I'd love to make the pillow mask work, but it doesn't seem likely and I don't know what changes I can make if I try again. Can anyone advise me? 

I'd also like to hear from other mouth breathers. I can change masks any time in the next month, and the instructor tried to steer me towards a full face mask, but it's massive and felt awkward and didn't seem compatible with side-sleeping. 

I know people say to newbies ""You'll get used to the CPAP."" And there are things I've gotten used to even though I swore at some point I could never get used to them. But it feels, genuinely, like I'll never get used to using a CPAP. 

If you're a slide sleeper PLUS a mouth breather, and have found a mask solution that makes life easier rather than interfering with sleep, please speak up. Thanks for reading.

1pgff0n,CPAP Usage and CSF Leak,"I recently had a sleep study and was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea with AHI 10 or so, and I am receiving a Resmed 11 CPAP tomorrow which, up until yesterday, I was really excited to start using. I have really poor sleep as of late and my oxygen has desaturated down to the mid 70s on quite a few occasions.

I have a complicated medical history; hEDS (Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome), history of Tethered Cord Syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, degenerative disc disease, and now OSA.

Also, since March of last year, I have shown signs of Intracranial Hypertension (a known problem related to OSA) and CSF leak: clear, watery discharge from my right nostril, repeated bacterial infections in my right ear, one of which was confirmed to be staph, pockets of fluid building up behind my right ear between the mastoid and cartilage, balance problems and vertigo, constant tinnitus and hearing loss, and visual problems including nystagmus, difficulty centering my eyes on what I'm looking at, etc. Of note on imaging is partially empty sella and opacification of the sphenoid sinus. Otherwise MRI and CT of sinuses and brain has been labeled grossly normal.

My sleep has gotten really bad and my doctor thinks the home study might have underestimated the severity of my OSA. Here is where the crux of the dilemma exists: I read that CPAP should *not* be used if there is suspicion of an active CSF leak. I have been trying to find specialists in my state who can diagnose and treat CSF leaks, but they are rare and poorly understood and I have been unable to get any treatment thus far as my ENT is relying on the CT which doesn't show any leak sites. But I have read that standard imaging, along with techs not trained to see these minute bony defects, is not enough to really nail down if and where there might be a problem.

Thanks for hanging with me thus far. My question to you, dear Reddit, is if there are any of you out there with current or past history of CSF leak who were able to use CPAP to treat your OSA. I am concerned about the risks of meningitis as I would essentially be pushing air and bacteria into a potential hole in my dura. I have to have a minimum compliance with this machine to satisfy the insurance company. Any advice? Should I try the CPAP with full face mask and see what happens?

My wife also has noticed me gasping for breath in the middle of the night and that my snoring has gotten miles worse. I figure their diagnosis is fairly spot on.

Anyway, I bought the Snore RX 'snoring device' and it really seems to work. My wife says I'm basically quiet throughout the night, as long as I have the mouth guard in. When I don't wear the mouth guard I snore like a chain saw. I can't tell if this is placebo or not but I've also noticed I wake up feeling way better, more alert, more awake etc. when I wear the device. 

The problem, my bottom teeth hurt like fuck. I even think my bottom front teeth moved forward since wearing the thing. 

Has anyone had experience with the custom fit mouth devices? Are they more comfortable on your teeth?

I know Daybreak makes a device but in dealing with them... I'm not stoked. The device is $3500, they have a monthly plan but it sums up to more. And in working with them, they've seemed kind of pushy sales wise. Maybe I'm wrong and they're dope.

My first sleep study, the technician said he didn't think I met the parameters, but the nurse practitioner said I did. I tried the CPAP for a while but I never felt that amazing ""bird on my shoulder feeling."" A coworker of mine had a more severe case and described his first morning after using the CPAP as incredible. 

Honestly, I think my issues were due to a lack of sleep, and too much beer and caffeine. 

2nd sleep study with the tiny, easy take-home device. Same diagnosis. I tried another CPAP and it didn't make a difference. At that time I was in a good depression and/or experiencing burnout from undiagnosed AutDHD. The physical symptoms can be significant. 

I even saw a hematologist once to check on something my GP was concerned about. I asked him and he added a test to my blood work. I forget what value he checked (arterial blood gas?), but it showed that my blood oxygen levels looked good. (The value represents an average or cumulative measurement, and a low value would show that I was experiencing some sort of 02 deficit.) 

I'm not trying to discourage anyone from getting tested, but it goes to show that doctors can (mildly) misdiagnose you if it looks close enough to the disease in which they specialize.

Fast forward to today. After 5 different sleep doktors this year I found one that was eager enough to really look into my data and found that central and mixed apneas are more frequent than purely obstructive ones. I finally bought a resmed cpap which I later flashed into a bipap machine.

I had a level 1 sleep study done which resulting in 18.7 AHI when side sleeping, AHI skyrockets to 68.2/h when supine. During the night I had 176 arousals/microarousals (plus 346 autonomic arousals at 53/h). Deep sleep (N3) reduced to 13.4%, light sleep (N1) increased to 20.3%, REM slightly up at 21.3%. Marked alpha intrusion (brain waves indicating poor relaxation into deeper sleep).

I’m trying to understand the amount of real deep sleep that I actually have. (As my phone statistics are most of the time full of shit) 

Most of the time I feel pretty tired and depressed. But when I take 1000mg of L-tyrosine + 25mg of Bromantane my dopamine levels skyrocket and I’m back to feeling my happy self again. But this is not a real solution to the problem. I need my body to fix these levels.

I guess there is a big correlation between the marked alpha intrusions, poor deep sleep and dopamine levels?

I’m looking for more information on this matter and how to fix those dopamine receptors.

I’m currently on bilevel mode S with epap 6.4 and ipap 10.4. This is helping. I’m keeping the mask on 8-9h every night and I’m gradually feeling a bit better. Currently AHI after a night is in the 3-5 AHI area with most of the time 50-% are central’s.

I do think my deep sleep has been so bad for so long (20 years plus) that this is not fixed within a few weeks or months.

Any help would be more than appreciated 🙏🏻

1pdhe28,Sleep Studies: Outpatient? Home study? Buy an Oximeter?,"I have no insurance and little money to spend. I’m pretty sure my issues are simply physical, deriving from my tongue and uvula relaxing and blocking my throat. The consensus seems to be that OTC devices (boil MAD’s, Head straps, etc.) are either not worth trying or have side effects (primarily the diy MAD fucking up your jaw and teeth). 
I’m thinking my best option is to purchase my own oximeter and monitor my own experiments, the first would be a tongue retention device. 
An at home test, while more affordable, is less comprehensive. Would an at home test be able to definitively recommend whether or not to jump straight to a cpap? 
An outpatient sleep study is comparatively out of the question financially, and would still result in needing to save up for whatever treatment it would potentially recommend. However, I could make it a goal to save up for one (and the treatment).

I am a cancer patient post CAR-T for multiple myeloma with inflammation and pain in most major joints including knees, hips, elbow and shoulders. I am a side sleeper so I wake continually throughout the night switching sides due to the pain. My Dr wants me to do a home sleep apnea test but if I am waking due to the joint pain discomfort, would this test be able to identify that it's due to sleep apnea vs my pain?

1pdf8jm,Difficulty exhaling and unable to fall asleep with cpap machine on,"I’ve currently been given a resmed airsense11 auto set by the nhs with the standard nasal plugs and piping, no humidifier. 

The first few nights I managed to sleep but since I’ve been really struggling to exhale and have been short of breath, I’ve looked at the videos and other posts on this and found the epr setting and it was set to two.

The trouble is I’ve now set it to three and I don’t see any noticeable difference. The starting pressure is already set as low as it will go at 4 so I can’t reduce this. Does anyone have any tips or tricks?

I’m not that fit at the moment so I’m guessing just improving general cardio fitness would probably help?

Thanks for any advice!",1764793100.0,5,11,SleepApnea,sleep
1pdcnxo,Does anyone seem to feel sluggish or sleepy at the exact same hours each day?,"Just curious. For me around 1:00 p.m. is when I start to feel just a bit off and it goes away after one or two hours and I'm back to having a normal amount of energy. 

I'm not currently using CPAP because I'm a side sleeper whose masks have leaked awfully because I tuck my arm under my pillow. But I'm working on a resolution at the moment. 

For now, just curious if anyone else seems to have the same hours per day that they feel sluggish. ",1764787443.0,4,1,SleepApnea,sleep
