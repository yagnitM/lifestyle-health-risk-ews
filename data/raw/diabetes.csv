1qan9dz,Diabetes and wounds,"35. M. I've been a bad diabetic for a while, and it all culminated a few days ago. I've been avoiding insulin and took Metformin and Jardiance, which I didnt even take that correctly. Well I got an ingrown hair on my lower buttcheek mid December that turned into a full blown abcess and sepsis.

After Emergency Surgery on 12/31, they did a debridement and took off a bunch of skin and infection from my undercarriage. My sugar was 768, and the docs say it was elevated due to the infection but lets be fair that was my constant I just didn't want to admit it. 

Now I'm on short acting and long acting insulin and honestly I feel better and feel so fucking stupid that I let this go on for so long. Now I have to deal with a gross wound for the next few weeks if not a few months. 

So, this is just a progress post so I could get my thoughts out. ",1768198174.0,1,0,diabetes,diabetes

1qaipk4,Accidental double dose of Jardiance today (10mg tablet),"Hey all. My Mother called me a bit ago pretty frazzled because she took a second Jardiance pill this evening on accident (she said that she normally takes on in the morning and that's it for the day). Apparently she mixed one in with her evening pills and now she's worried. I just don't know much about this sort of thing other than what I've found on Google, which isn't much to be honest.

Is there anything that she has to worry about? I'm not sure if I will need to head over there to make sure she's ok, or if it won't affect her much. Could I get your opinion, please? Thanks so much in advance.",1768184713.0,2,5,diabetes,diabetes

1qagcqt,Overwhelmed is an understatement.,"Even though I got diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in January 2025, I still don’t know enough of what I should know when it comes to this shitty disease. It feels like there’s no end to learning about diabetes both medically and physically. It also feels like such a heavy ball and chain and makes me feel so overwhelmed with navigating having to constantly figure out what you can/cant eat, giving up foods that you enjoy, figuring out what meds work while experiencing ugly side effects that wreck your body, having to figure out what causes spikes, having to constantly check your blood sugar levels, log it, cycling through apps to find something that is both helpful and effective, etc etc etc I’m so over it like all of these restrictions feel so fucking suffocating but on the bright side I’m now working with the help of a dietitian which thankfully she’s been helping educate me about nutrition, diet, and about how diabetes works. I barely had my first session last week but she’s been very helpful however I am still very angry at the diagnosis and scared because I don’t want to experience diabetic complications like amputation, neuropathy, blindness which I have had a taste of when my blood sugar was high that I woke up with blood vessels in my eye that burst when I was sleeping, brief periods of impaired eyesight and things like that… I’ve already had a stroke that physically disabled me at 19 years old, had cancer 4 years later, and now I have diabetes too??

1qabl4b,What's the worst part of maintaining of this disease for you?,"For me it is by far sensor changes. I don't have my personal stats, but I would say easily 30 percent of the time there is an issue of *some* kind when I change my sensor. 

The rest is.. fine. Pump site changes are never an issue because I'm using a metal cannula and it doesn't kink. When scar tissue builds up that might be a different story but for now they are easy. Cartridge changes are nothing as well. I've become very used to removing the bubbles and everything. 

It's changing the damn sensors. I dread that day because there is at least somewhat of a chance my night will be ruined dealing with a stupid sensor. And being on a closed loop system, I can't just ""let it fix itself"" or I'll either get way too much insulin or not enough. It's a nightmare every 10 days.

1qa32bd,Low carbers - cheaper konjac noodles,"I know there are a variety of diets in here - but for anyone eating low carb, I recently tried ""Miracle noodles"" brand noodles of konjac aka shirataki noodles and really enjoyed them as a rice noodle substitute. 

My fasting glucose this week has been really good, and I think eating these at lunch this week has played a role. 

They're reallyyyy low calorie, high fiber, and filling! But it was basically $5 for two servings of noodles...

Anyway, did some research and found the same noodles for $1.79 (on sale, normally $2) for 3 servings at my local Chinese grocer in the refrigerated section. For those who don't live near a Chinese grocer, there are many online options as well that are cheaper than the dieter-focused brands like Miracle noodles. 

Eating low carb is expensive, glad to have found a way to save a bit...

1q9v0oz,First Time CGM User Complaints,"Hi. I've been a t1 diabetes for 17 years. I just switched to a Freestyle Libre 2 Plus (3 is not available in my country) CGM. I find it a bit inaccurate. I know that CGMs have a margin of error and that's completely normal due to them not monitoring the glucose from blood, yes, I am aware of that. However, this inaccuracy situation eliminates the only reason I wanted to buy these things, the low glicose alarm. I find my CGM to always be 20 to 30 units LOWER than my actual blood glicose readings. The device thinks that my glucose is 55, and It's time to wake me up with an alarm, however, It's actually steadily 80 and It's been like that for hours. So I don't actually needed to be woken up. This drives me crazy!!! And in the app, you can't lower the low glicose alarm past under 60, which is stupid af. If they let me choose something like 40 for low alarms, that would be perfect, but no, I can't decide on that because the companies that built these sensors thinks they know the diabetes care better than us.

Monday I went to see my massage therapist that I see every 2 weeks just for general relaxation massages as I have anxiety. I have had trouble with my siactica in the past and on Monday she said it felt as if my siactica was swollen, hips super tight and lower back tight and she was honestly surprised it wasn’t causing me any pain. When working my siactica like normal, I notice that my blood sugar tends to drop but it always rises back up after and I’ve never had any problems all these years (I started seeing her in 2023). Fast forward to mondays session my sugar went low during & seemed to get worse as I was grocery shopping 30 mins after the appointment. (Of course I treated it) but it got so low that my legs were shaking, bit of confusion, and hands shaking. I barely made it to buy a juice and get to the car. Following this I spent 2 days out of breath from just simple conversation mixed with forgetting my words/thoughts mid sentence but good blood sugar.  

This has since passed and I am feeling better minus the occasional forgetting my words again mid sentence & today I’m having a bit of a headache/ feels as if I’m having congestion in the middle of my forehead  but I’m blaming that on what should be starting my cycle in 3 ish days. 

I am out of state and messaged my primary care, she is concerned because my sugar dropped to the 60s which normally does not cause me to be out of breath for days. Once treated everything is okay I might be a bit tired but okay. 

Primary would like me to be seen in person for physical exam because she is worried it could have been something else causing my symptoms since this normally never happens to me. 

I guess my question is since my symptoms have subsided, is it even worth taking up a spot at the walk in clinic on Monday for something I’m not fully experiencing anymore?

1q9e4es,Relationship with a T1D going through burnout,"Hi! I (20f) have been dating my T1D boyfriend (22m) for a few months now and I absolutely want to build a life with him, but there’s one thing that has been bothering me since the start of our relationship. I believe he’s burnt because his A1C has been around 9.5 for about 4-5 years (he told me). He knows he should take better care of his body, but he always injects his insulin way too late after meals and does it based on feeling because he doesn’t check his blood sugar and refuses a CGM (they’re quite expensive in our country and not covered by insurance for everyone + he said he didn’t wanna spend so much money on something that would only be of little help – which I disagree with, but can’t convince him). He also eats A LOT of sugary snacks, drinks and fast food and every time I ask questions about his diabetes management both out of curiosity and also to gently remind him that he should go easy on his body, he says he knows there are things he needs to improve, but never does anything. I can only imagine how hard it must be to manage this condition, so I understand why he’s like this, but for me health is a very important thing as I have horrible health anxiety and tend to worry about not only mine but also my loved ones’ health A LOT. I’m very aware that I can’t help someone who doesn’t want to be helped, but if he doesn’t change anything, I’m not sure how I’ll be able to deal with that in the future. I’m very careful about bringing up this topic with him because the last thing I want to do is pressure him or make him feel guilty or like a failure.

I have been prediabetic for the past couple of years. I tried several approaches but could not reverse it, and it seemed to be progressing toward diabetes. Recently, I also developed mild fatty liver. I started a **ketogenic diet (carb<30 g/day)**, **calorie deficit (<1200 kcal/day)**, and **intermittent fasting (18:6) simultaneously**.

My glucose level is now \~5.0 mmol/L (it was \~6.5 mmol/L for about a year). I have lost \~10 lb. It is still too early to draw conclusions about my liver condition.

**My questions are:** Is that really it? was it actually this simple? is this improvement permanent of temporary? how long should or can I continue this approach? I am somewhat concerned because I am consuming very limited fruits and vegetables and do not feel I am getting enough energy. To be safe, I am mostly relying on multivitamins.

Normal bread that I can buy in my country would shoot my BG to the stratosphere so I've started baking my own bread from nuts and seeds and holy I had to skip dinner yesterday because it was so good I couldn't stop snacking on it. I'm slowly creeping my basal up so I can start reintroducing fruit into my diet, very much looking forward to that.

I have been stagnating for many years now. It is improbable that I'll die of old age, best case one day I'll fall happily asleep and never wake, worst case I'll start loosing digits and eyesight which will force me to end it myself. But that day isn't here yet. Life deals punches sometimes, I hope this one makes me pivot and finally get my life on track. Thank you for reading this far.",1767959908.0,10,5,diabetes,diabetes

I receive a glucometer for free through a diabetes program offered by insurance. I signed up because I was just overwhelmed. I tested my blood sugar immediately after waking up, right before eating a meal, 1 hour after and 2 hours after a meal. At one point, I was pricking my fingers 11 times a day.

I had a follow up with the nurse practitioner Monday. I requested a cgm due to burnout from constant finger pricking and just sometimes forgetting because I suspect I have ADHD and get hyper focus on working or doing something else and forget to test or ignore alarms. he said I did not need it and insurance probably would not approve it since I'm technically a controlled diabetic without the need of insulin. Said I can test if feeling off but just concentrate on healthy eating and eat when I'm hungry. Don't force myself to eat if my body isn't signaling it's hungry. He said it wasn't my blood sugar levels to worry about. Just my A1c. 

So I stopped checking. I randomly woke up and have been reading more about managing T2 and foods to eat. I haven't been eating because 1)we are on a budget and we don't have the money for me to try out different specialty foods and 2)I'm barely hungry as is.

My endocrinologist prescribed me with Mounjaro and Dexcom G7 sensors, and both have been saints for me. With those, plus a much better diet and much more exercise, I was able to lose 30 pounds and am feeling better than ever. My A1C dropped from 9.4 in September to 5.8 in December. 

A few months before I was diagnosed, my mom retired from her job and her very, very good insurance, and we switched over to my dads insurance. I’m still a college student, and my job doesn’t give benefits to part timers. Going from a PPO plan to a HDHP has been tough. Last year I didn’t have any copays since we met the deductible with my hospital stay, but new year, new deductible. Thankfully, my insurance is still covering my Mounjaro, which was our biggest worry, and I only pay $25 for it. The Dexcom on the other hand went from *nothing*  to $390 a month until the deductible is met, which is not manageable, for obvious reasons, and the deductible is around $1800. My pharmacist and doctor have talked with the insurances, which lead nowhere even with prior authorization. I was also given a number to call Dexcom about copay assistance, which I’m going to do tomorrow.

Scrolling through instagram I saw that there are a few alternative sensors that are marketed for weight loss (similar to the difference between Mounjaro and Zepbound), like Stelo and Signos. These would be much cheaper, Stelo I can get for around $90 a month, which is manageable. I also saw adds for a year round implanted sensor, which would be amazing since these Dexcom can be a pain in the ass when they fall off or fail. But A. That’s for insulin users, which I don’t use, and B. If my insurance won’t cover Dexcom, they sure as shit aren’t gonna cover something that costs 10x as much. There’s also Freestyle Libre, but I doubt my insurance will cover that too. 

Does anyone have any advice or experience with these alternatives?

1q6v3qm,Unsure how to help my mom with her Type 2 Diabetes diagnosis,"Hi, 

My mom was diagnosed this past summer with Type 2 diabetes. She is 60, and has been in denial for a while. She refuses to say diabetes and just says ""my blood sugar problem"". My brothers and I have stepped back and let her do her thing, as when we first tried to help her it was not well received and she was openly hostile. 

She visited for the holidays and new information has come to light that has us extremely worried. At her last Dr. appt her blood sugar was so high the Dr wanted to admit her to the hospital right then and there. When my mom refused and tried to leave they had her sign some form releasing them from liability if she had something happen to her once she refused care and left. That freaked us out enough but her behavior over the holidays also raised alarm bells for us. These are a few examples:

\- Having to ask questions 5-6 times, and still not remembering information. 

\- No longer wanting to participate in games she had previously played with the family, saying they were too complicated. 

\- Focusing hard on conversations and mouthing the words of a conversation to try to follow along.

1q6r2e1,Everyone is different…,"This sub really really really helped me when I was first diagnosed, so at different timeframes I feel like I owe it to come back and share any updates. 

Diagnosed at 7.1 in March 2025. 35 YO male. Was 210 lbs. 

=> 5.0 in July => 5.1 in September => and 4.8 today at latest labs. 750 mg metformin a day. 

Went really really low carb. STRICT keto from diagnosis until July. It helped tremendously. 

Lost 55 lbs and obviously got those BG numbers down. I never really counted my carbs tbh, but just aimed for as low as possible. (I would stress about 2 carbs in a Gatorade Zero..)

My labs in Sept. had really high cholesterol. Quite high - super high in almost all of it. 

After September in particular I really started backing off keto some. Added in eating small amounts of real bread, some fruit, small bites of dessert, more “keto” breads tortillas, ect. 

I feel so much better at about ~75 ish carbs a day than >20 where I was. Bowl  movements so much better. Less stressed about eating. More fun eating out, being present instead of stressing about carb counting. 

I still watch what I do closely. I still test in the morning about 5 days a week. Have weight stabilized since July. And feel good. Cholesterol numbers were a lot more normal this round, too. 

I know it’s so early, and obviously at 75 carbs a day I’m not going wild, but I think adding those in purposefully helped everything, whereas I saw it as straight danger before. ",1767818599.0,9,7,diabetes,diabetes

Im fucking tired and over this fucking disease. T1 22 years and i am exhausted.

Im over my body being so damn skinny and having no fat left for injections or CGMs. Im over all this fucking scar tissue FOR WHAT.

Im stuck in this useless cycle of not gaining weight cuz im not eating enough - not eating enough because im so mentally tired and because in order to eat i have to what?? Take a shot - but taking the shots i need increases the scar tissues, but if i dont take the shot then i get ketones - ketones burn off any fat i BARELY HAVE ANYWAYS - cycle repeats.

Im tired. Im so tired.

This is my… idek… 3-5th failed sensor now??? Why??? PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE SCAR TISSUE. But theres no where else on my body i can put then BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS DAMAGED. It started in November, readings started to be 30-100mg lower than bs. Next one killed itself 4 hours in. Thought it couldve been a batch issue. Got them replaced. Next ones same fucking issues. Got maybe ONE that was consistently just 20mg off, that was fine. Least it was consistent yk !! Since then been using only the replacements, last one was AGAIN 50mg lower and killed itself 3 days early. Whatever fine, aint the first time atp.

What has broken me down today was this morning- after waiting 12 hrs for the new one to presoak, activating it and gts (and YES i made sure best i could to sleep on the opposite side). I got readings for… 5 hrs? Then 6am it screamed at me LOW (i was 80) then went out… came back for a split second 30 mins later and never fucking came back.. i spent THREE HOURS doing absolutely everything i could to try and “set the environment” correctly so it could reconnect. Sat up straight, drank like 25oz of water, peed, walked a little, stayed still, put absolutely NO pressure on that side and let that arm just be completely relaxed. Nothing nothing nothing.

11:30am BEEP BEEEP BEEEP BEEP. Sensor fucking dead AGAIN. Im so over this im… im so over it. I already know my A1C is royally fucked from the past 2-3 months of faulty technology and being too busy to manually check myself all the time. But GUESS WHAT. Now im going to have to now!!! Because clearly my body is broken and there is no point in constantly back to back to back stabbing myself for NO REASON just to let another sensor die on me. And like… WHY does it take weeks to MONTHS for scar tissue to heal??? LIKE WTF.

Im so exhausted i dont have the mental energy to barely wake myself up and eat breakfast nonetheless having to hurt my poor fingers daily again just so i dont fucking die. Im so over this shit bro. Ive been out of burnout (which lasted over a decade) for about 2 years now…. CGMs spoiled me and brought me out (along with this community i had found).

1q6ifkm,How to start eating well when I don’t want to eat at all,"My doctor was very insistent that I try Ozempic because my blood sugar wasn’t adequately controlled by Jardiance and Metformin. It wasn’t controlled because of my diet.

I take Adderall for ADHD, so it’s not unusual for me not to eat all day, and graham crackers and bagels are staples in my diet. Now I’m on week 3 of Ozempic and I just don’t want to eat. I’ve always been a very picky eater, and it’s almost impossible for me to eat something I don’t like, but I’m scared of losing a lot of weight rapidly and destroying my gall bladder. Should I start relying on Ensure? Even MetRX bars are too much to force down.

\*\*Update that turned into a therapy journal prompt:\*\* Thank you all so much. I realized why I really don’t want to take Ozempic. My partner has cancer and he’s on a feeding tube. This has complicated my eating (feeling uncomfortable eating food in front of him/smelling up our apartment with cooking) and being a caregiver makes it really easy to ignore my own health. Part of me likes the idea of Ensure because then the burden of food is removed altogether, just cartons of liquid for both of us. But snacking after he’s fallen asleep and my Adderall has worn off has also become me time.

How I look has never mattered less to me, and rapid major weight loss would be a stressful change even if it came via a fairy godmother’s wand, much less with loose skin and gallstones. So…I’m going to see a dietitian to work on a meal plan to control my sugar while losing weight slowly, and maybe help finding support/accountability.

1q6g1ov,New T2D diagnosis - Looking for some wisdom.,"Hi everyone: just got diagnosed a couple of weeks ago after a direly stressful period in my life-- I've basically been in hell since July, and have only recently come out of it. I probably could have developed it in October after I got a call from my HRT provider about a concerning UA result, but I think dealing with it back then would have been too much for me. Went to see my PCP about a yeastie that's been stubbornly sticking around since Labor Day, and walked out with a *lot* of new prescriptions. I've been trying to cope with humor, *'oh, y'know, no sugar, I'm sweet enough'* and all that, but it's...not really working that well.

I'm just kind of mystified here, because this REALLY came out of nowhere. My glucose has never been crazy, and I've never been prediabetic. I'm a really active person; I can walk 10 miles at a clip AND I'm in the gym twice a week with a trainer who gives me hard workouts. I don't even really like sweets or soda, bread's a different story, but I don't eat bread like that either. I don't even feel any different than normal! I already spoke with a dietician, showed her pictures of my fridge and meals and all, and she noted that I'm basically doing everything right. Honestly, my PCP and I agree it's probably genetics and stress that did it, but god, this sucks. 

I'm probably going to be starting Ozempic soon, along with the metformin, and I'm just...nervous about that. I've got some conflicting feelings about it due to how gladhanded everyone seems to be about trying to make everyone with more than 5% bodyfat shoot up. 

Ever since I was little, my mom has always reacted to me eating something sweet, even something small, with 'you're going to get diabetes', and now that we're here, Jesus, my self-confidence has taken a hit, even though, logically, I know it's not my fault. Plus, I've got ADHD, and now I have to add a hell of a lot more steps to my daily routine all of a sudden. I'm just glad I stomped out my needlephobia long ago by being trans (i HIGHLY recommend getting yourself some 1 1/2"" 18G needles to compare your other needle to and go ""wow! I sure am glad I don't have to use THAT""), but jeez, it's like I'm collecting all the things that make me stab myself with stuff.

So, questions: What do your morning routines look like? Is there anything that made the initial period easier for you to adjust to, and is there anything indispensable that you wish you started doing or using earlier on? If I can somehow stop feeling like I'm being chased by wolves, will it help?

1q65mud,My father has Diabetes,"This is just a post to just get things off my chest. 

My dad...well he has diabetes type 1

The past year for him has been a roller-coaster to say the least from beating stage 3 kidney cancer to then being ""gifted"" immunotherapy induced type 1 diabetes. 

The past 5 months I helped him navigate the VA system getting him setup with his doctors. He's a little older in his years at 58 and so struggles with medical stuff.

He started on MDI as most diabetics do, eventually moving into getting a CGM and then moving onto a omnipod 5 since December 19th of 2025

He struggles and constantly worries having only one kidney at 60% to 70% efficiency that the diabetes is a death sentence. 

I talk with him daily, upwards of 10 plus times a day helping him with his dosages, guiding him through best practices and learning numerous things to aid him in his diabetic journey. 

The Omnipod confuses him alot with all the different settings, but we work through it day by day dose by dose to cement his understanding and muscle memory on what to do

Some days he has bad days and some days he has good days.

Today he called me and he had a mini episode of just feeling like life's not worth living. 

For the first time I felt lost in how to help him, I don't have the disease and so I can't say I relate to his struggles, but I try my hardest to show him how well he's doing and how he's managed to keep his TIR at 84% plus.

My dad who has always been pretty strong willed just broke and was saying, if I have to deal with feeling this shitty all day for the rest of my life, what's the point in living.....

That....killed...me tonight, but I know things will get better, I just have to be strong for him when he's down.

I called UHC to ask about my coverage and they said it will be covered but I will need to order from their list of durable medical equipment supplier. From the list I chose Byram Healthcare. 

My midwife was taking too long to respond to Byram's request for additional information so I asked my endocrinologist if she can send the prescription. She did and sent the required notes and labs. A few days later I received an email from Byram that the cgm has been shipped. 

I checked my online account and saw my balance was zero. 

A few weeks has passed and today I received a letter from UHC that the cgm prescription from my midwife has been denied, as it is not medically necessary. I wasn't sure why they would then cover the prescription from my endocrinologist so I went and checked. Byram's website still says zero so I wanted to keep record and clicked the download invoice button, and upon checking the invoice, only there the balance says $975. 

Next, I checked my UHC claims and it says they denied Byram Healthcare claim. 

I had a sample cgm and it was reliable so I didn't use the six that Byram has sent me yet. Byram didn't tell me it was denied by UHC prior to sending it to me. And seeing the zero balance under order history, I thought it was covered. Also since the insurance rep said it will be covered if I buy it from their list of suppliers. 

 If it was not covered I wouldn't have ordered it. I called Byram but they were already closed today. EOB from my insurance company only says $0 patient responsibility and that they denied the claim. 

Can anyone advise how I should approach this situation?",1767671497.0,2,19,diabetes,diabetes

Finally the Doc agreed, but then told me I could only get enough test strips to test 2x a week. How am I supposed to effectively monitor my glucose with 2 strips a week?

1q4g4bb,I hate having a cgm sometimes. + how to cope with bg obsession?,"This December became the 10th anniversary of me being diabetic (24F). A year ago around March i ran out of cgms and struggled w getting the prescription renewed since the year prior i had moved. This led to me going months and months without using a CGM and in a lot of ways it felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. But I had some frankly scary moments where I had pretty low lows that turned into instances of what felt like derealization, and other effects of hypoglycemia. So tonight, I started up a CGM again to avoid those dangerous lows.

And now starts the trouble. I'm quickly remembering why I hated using this thing. I use the G7, and I'm constantly staring at my screen to monitor BG highs and lows. I get super frustrated seeing it start to go up, even if it's normal that it does (like after eating) and I can feel the compulsion to overcorrect with insulin and micromanage it. 

I want to manage my highs and lows, but I hate the mental stress this causes me. My range is healthy (if a bit low due to my overcorrecting problem), so really I shouldn't be feeling this way. But I hate having to wait to eat if its too high or the way I physically feel if it's high or low. 

Has anyone found ways to manage this? Other posts I've read about CGM obsession say it will wear off but. In my experience, even after all this time, you can clearly see it has not.

Thank you in advance, and thanks for reading if you made it this far.

1q3tqbi,Diagnosed but I still don’t know what type I am.,"For context, I’ve been diagnosed as type 1 (October 2025) but I don’t think I’m actually type 1

Because I’m only 21 and not considered obese, I don’t really fit type 2 characteristic so getting diagnosed as type 2 didn’t make too much sense for me.

During my initial diagnosis, I was hooked up to a cannula with insulin for over 48 hours with multiple fingerpicks, blood pressure taken and bloods taken for testing so I’d hope I was giving them enough data to work with. It was genuinely a very stressful time since I did not even intend to get my diabetes checked - I was in a completely different clinic for something else - yet was brought to different hospital beds and rooms to monitor my levels.

Skip forward about a month, I get a letter stating that the type 1 antibodies weren’t present in my body and that my c-peptide levels weren’t typical type 1 levels either (can’t really remember the exact details though it was brought up on the letter) but for some reason my body isn’t using the insulin it produces correctly. I was advised to get genetic testing done for MODY but have yet to get that done due to the holidays and just unfortunate timing.

Currently I’m on insulin (Novorapid + Lantus) and that seems to be working quite well according to my CGM (freestyle libre2). Im glad insulin’s working but there’s something uneasy about knowing I’m not fully diagnosed yet, just considered type 1 until further clarification. 

It’s stressful and honestly quite exhausting attending STEP meetings for type 1 diabetes knowing I might not even fully belong there, just cause I’m taking insulin.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m very grateful for the services I’m given and that my body is reacting beautifully to insulin (85% in range currently!!) it’s just very confusing when I’m also getting checked for blood pressure issues and dental issues at the same time. 

Just hoping to get a final diagnosis this year and to finally know what medications are meant for me. I know there’s a chance I’ll just stay on insulin - and I’m ready to accept that - but if oral medications are actually all I need, I would love to get it all sorted.

I’ve always been a bit embarrassed about the need to do testing and I don’t know the best way to do this when I’m out and about.

1q3h2y7,Our dad has been lying and we don’t know how to help,"I hope it’s okay I’m posting as family, if not feel free to remove

My dad (66M) is a type 2 diabetic, we thought managed with just daily meds. Most of his side of the family is type 2 - and his relatives have experienced a wide range of complications, so we assumed he was taking his diabetes seriously. Our family has such significant history my PCP even has me proactively doing things to reduce risk (nutritionist, exercise, checking A1c 2x a year). 

Three days ago we (my sister and I) made the decision to bring him to hospital because he’s gone septic before easily and was having concerning symptoms (we don’t live with him but we have family that checks on him, then calls us, and we end up making a lot of these decisions). He was feverish, bg 261, had a stomach bug for the past few days, couldn’t stop throwing up and wasn’t coherent or able to communicate functionally. After we brought him in he kept trying to check himself out but eventually the hospital kept him to monitor for diverticulitis and then another night later sent him home today saying it was a stomach bug and he is improving. 

When I brought him home I found out he’s been taking his metformin but not his Amaryl since October. He also stopped checking his blood glucose around late October (I checked all his glucometers). When he was testing he was ranging from 70s-330s according to his devices, and late in the day often 150-270. I set up one of the glucometers to sent notifications to my phone via an app whenever he tests and told him if he’s not testing I will know and bug him and he said okay fair. 

My sister and I are worried he’s been depressed and not taking care of himself. He’s got a lot personally going on that’s really hard on him but always says he’s okay. We don’t know where to start. We talked to his sister in law (his brother is type 2 as well) and agreed he probably needs to see a doctor asap to get meds straightened out, decide if he needs emergency insulin to keep around, and come up with a better plan. His pcp doesn’t really do much if at all to manage it. Any advice what to do? We don’t want to be overbearing or impinge on his ability to decide risk/his autonomy but we are deeply concerned for his health after seeing how hard this stomach bug hit him and how he’s not been keeping up with his meds and testing ",1767503067.0,36,37,diabetes,diabetes

1q3ai24,Minimalistic Travel Case/Bag for Someone With T1D,"Hi everyone! My best friend is going to graduate from college this month and I was thinking of what to get them as a graduation gift.

They mentioned considering [this product](https://www.muji.us/collections/toiletry-cases/products/hanging-case-with-pouch-ohca1a2s), potentially for their diabetic supplies. I honestly don’t think it would work too well, but I could tell they are looking for something that doesn’t look like a medical bag [like they have now](https://www.amazon.com/MEDMAX-Resistant-Insulated-Medication-Organizer/dp/B09WYK9D66?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1).

As I was looking into bags, I also remembered that they are going to Norway for two weeks in March. They told me that packing diabetic supplies for a trip is super stressful, and I want to help take some weight off their shoulders. So I was thinking of also getting them a larger bag or luggage insert that will help them organize everything and put a list inside of everything they should bring to help guide them. They have traveled for a month before, so they do have experience, but I want to help in any way I can.

That being said, I would like help finding the following products:

1. A small travel case for daily usage that doesn’t look like a medical bag, but that would organize their diabetic supplies well.
2. Either a large bag (again, preferably one that doesn’t look like a medical bag) or luggage insert that will help them organize enough diabetic supplies for two weeks out of the country.

I would also appreciate help in curating a list of what they should bring, so that way they wouldn’t have to think too much into it. If it helps, they have Type 1 Diabetes, use the Omnipod 5, and the Dexcom G7.

Thank you so much and Happy New Year!

1q3a8xi,Scared about advanced diabetic retinopathy and retinal detachment — looking for stories of recovery,"Hi everyone,

I’m 41, have had type 2 diabetes for many years (mostly uncontrolled until the past year), and recently experienced some serious eye problems. My right eye had a retinal detachment involving the macula back in August and has been recovering with silicone oil in place. Cataract surgery and oil removal are planned, but I’m still dealing with limited vision right now.

A few days ago, I noticed sudden changes in my left eye — increased wavy lines, blurry vision, and some dark spots — and I was told the retina there is starting to detach as well. I was given an injection in that eye and within a day symptoms started to rapidly accelerate in the left eye. Now the left eye is barely more useful than the right- very dim and blurry, cannot read and type without magnification. I’m barely functional right now. I’m scheduled for surgery soon, but I’m scared about the possibility of being without ANY functional vision for a period of time and about what the long-term outcome might be.

I’m not asking for medical advice, just looking to hear from anyone who has been through something similar:

	•	If you had a retinal detachment due to diabetic retinopathy, how did your vision recover?

	•	What was your final visual function like — could you read, see faces, drive?

	•	Did your vision improve over months after surgery, or was it permanent loss?

Hearing real experiences would help me understand what to expect and feel less alone. Thanks for sharing.

Despite this, my insurance refuses to cover it - and I’d gladly pay cash, but pharmacies won’t let me do that because my insurance forbids it. This just seems absolutely ridiculous.

1q1yygx,Update on Recent Diagnosis,"This is my first post on Reddit as I normally come on just to check things out. At the end of September, I went to the emergency room, experiencing symptoms of what I eventually found out was Type 2 diabetes. I could barely walk into the hospital and to be perfectly honest, I wasn’t going to the doctor and maintaining a healthy lifestyle like I should have been. My A1C was at a 14.1 and the doctors told me my blood sugar was over 1000. They immediately put me on an insulin drip and I was in ICU for 4 out of the 5 days I was in the hospital.

Upon discharge, I was prescribed 50 units of Lantus, twice daily, 20 units of Novolog before meals, and a dose of metformin before meals. However, the hospital told me I didn’t need to take the Novolog or metformin if my blood glucose was below 120 mg/dL. I was also prescribed a blood glucose monitor to prick my fingers 4 times a day. 

Now here’s the update. I’ve been seeing my PCP more often, prioritizing my health and managing my diabetes. I have nothing but great things to say about my doctor and his practice. I no longer take any of the medications I listed above (the Lantus pens were a pain and they kept getting stuck). They switched me to Tresiba, which I take 36 units once a day (stark contrast from the 100 units I was taking in October). I also wear a Dexcom G7, which for the most part I like and it lessens the number of times I prick my finger. 

The doctor also prescribed me Mounjaro as I expressed interest in losing weight. I’m currently taking 7.5mg. Since June 2025, I have lost a total of 60lbs (this was a combination of being sick, the Mounjaro and change in diet. Just factoring the Mounjaro and change in diet, I lost 30lbs in 2 months). 

I also visited a diabetes and nutrition center that the hospital referred me to. I took a class learning about diabetes and proper eating on diabetes. I had two other appointments with a nurse that works there and she was amazing. My last visit in early December, she told me I only need to come back as needed, that she sees me possibly going off insulin, and that she hasn’t seen a success story like mine in a long time.

Now for the big news since you all are probably wondering (or maybe not lol). What is my A1C currently? As of December 24th, 2025, my A1C is at 5.4! I was so excited to see that number! I’ve come along way since that 14.1 on September 28th. I visited my PCP on December 31st and he said he was proud of how far I’ve come

I know there are some things I still need to work on, like the motivation to exercise, but I’m so proud of the results. Also, an endocrinologist referral will probably happen in the future. However, so far, I seem to be managing as well as I can be, for being a newbie to all of this. ",1767361456.0,11,3,diabetes,diabetes
1q1xk0d,Thoroughly confused this week after letting loose during the holidays.,"Hi,

So I was diagnosed with Type 2 in early November. Had an A1C of 11.7. I was scared, but knew I had to make big changes. I decided to go without meds and try lifestyle changes first. I lost about 20-25lbs, went on a very low carb diet (not keto but not far from it either), ate no added sugar during this time, walking almost daily, and then taking some supplements (Berberine, Garlic, Magnesium, and Cinnamon along with my multivitamins and collagen that I have always taken)

All of that stuff was working for me, after the first week I was floating around 100 at the highest, and then for the past month I have consistently been seeing myself in the 80s and 90s, and some 70s here and here on my BG monitor, only time I would ever see 100s is dawn phenomenon in the morning which would be like 103-105 at worst before going back down to double digits.

During the week of Christmas Eve and New Years, I decided to enjoy the holidays, and let go a little bit. I ate a ton of carbs, mac & cheese, mini calzones, pizza, ramen, potatoes, sandwiches, fried foods, bread, etc. When I had my first meal on Christmas Eve, I was happy to be eating regular food, but also worried about how high my blood sugar was going to go. But this is where it gets confusing, I checked after 60 minutes, and then again at 2 hours after eating. The highest I saw my blood sugar at that time, was 88, I was stunned.

That then prompted me to let loose a bit, and had some of the foods I listed before during the course of this past week to keep testing and see how my blood sugar responds, almost all of it after 1 and 2 hours, I was still in double digits, some 80s, and some 90s, some I did multiple tests at the same time. I did have one spike that was short lived, but that was 115 which is still not that bad.

I just don't understand, I am not on meds, and a few days also forgot my supplments. I had a high A1C, I can't help but wonder if something threw the blood work off and maybe I was misdiagnosed, but I do not believe that is the case, since the A1C is a 3month average, so even though the year prior to it I ate very unhealthy and frequently, I know that is very unlikely. Can the lifestyle changes really make such a big difference is such a short time?

1q1u28g,Flat amount of insulin every meal regardless of what the meal is… is that normal?,"Hi all, not looking for any medical advice here. I just want to see if other people think this feels “off”. I have a checkup in a couple of weeks so I’d like to go into that as informed as possible…


So I’m coming up on 3 months on insulin and maybe 5 months type 1 diabetic.  When they put me on insulin, they just told me to do 2 units of fast acting before every meal. No matter if that’s a burger and chips, or a salad. 

I assumed this was a “starter” strategy to get me used to regular injecting before starting to refine it. I assumed that at my 6 week follow up, they’d get me adapting my insulin but they didnt. 

Now I have a CGM, I can clearly see that I might be at 6.0 before a meal with low amount of carbs and I inject 2 units. Or I might be at 12 .5 and about to eat something heavier on carbs and I still inject 2.

I suppose my basic questions are:

1. Did anyone else approach it this way at the start?

2. How much should I challenge this at next checkup?

3. Am I crazy for thinking this is weird? I generally trust doctors and the medical fields but I can’t get my head around the logic here…",1767345225.0,5,21,diabetes,diabetes
1q1su2n,any diabetics using R-ALA supplements like Neurazenx for nerve pain or fatigue?,"
not giving medical advice, just genuinely curious.

i’ve been managing diabetes for a while now and recently started noticing more nerve discomfort and fatigue, especially later in the day. blood sugar is fairly controlled, but the nerve pain and low energy still creep in.

i’ve been reading about how some diabetics use R-ALA (R-alpha lipoic acid) for nerve support, energy metabolism, and oxidative stress. some people mention combining it with b vitamins or carnitine, but it’s hard to tell what actually helps long term vs what’s just hype.

1q1mtcj,"Recently diagnosed, need help with fiber.","Found out two weeks ago that my GP should have diagnosed me with type 2 in april, but failed or neglected to do so.  That resulted in a possibly related health incident that sent me to the urgent care and thats where we found out about my situation.  Following that I got an appointment with a diabetic nutritionist and a endocrinologist. Both recommended adding fiber to my meals via vegetables to slow down the release of sugars from the foods I eat.  My issue is that I am autistic, ADHD and I receive a lot of dopamine from food.  Unfortunately for me, that almost never includes vegetables.  I find the taste of many of them repulsive and has in the past actually caused me to vomit.  I'm aware that this is likely why I am in my situation, and I'm under no illusion that my dietary practices for a lot of my life have landed me here. 

 I'm in no way trying to skirt responsibility for it, and I am dedicated to making changes and since my diagnosis I have been working very hard to try and get over these hangups and my nutritionist wants me to work on a phased plan to change my diet over some time, so I'm not crashing my blood sugar from where my body is used to.  The goal is a phased reduction to give my system time to adjust to the new norm.  I've already eliminated all sodas from my diet before this diagnosis, so that thankfully is out of my daily intake.  My problem comes partially from my family.  They have latched on to this idea that I must include fiber at all times, and that often means lettuce being included. I do not like lettuce.  I find the taste of it extremely overpowering and find that it can effectively ruin a food for me.  I can handle salads sometimes, but for example if I have tacos, I find the lettuce just overpowers most of the other flavors and almost makes it taste watered down somehow.  I can handle broccoli most of the time, and generally enjoy it, but as a foodie, I cannot just have the same food over and over again, or I *will* begin to hate it.  I've had some reasonable luck with asparagus and spinach lately.  Beans unfortunately are a textural nightmare for me, that includes basically every variety of beans, and peas.  

So I guess what my big ask here is, can anyone share any way to incorporate fiber into my diet in ways that don't completely kill my desire to eat?  I don't expect I'll be like this forever as I expose myself to more vegetables on the regular, but I'm deeply concerned about the next month or two.  I feel like I'm developing an eating disorder here, as there are many times I'd just rather not eat anything at all, and I end up having to force myself to. Going to the grocery store right now is a torment matrix of depression and resentment, so I've not had the mental energy to explore my options yet.  I'm struggling to come to terms with the diagnosis alone, and lumping the dietary issues on top of it has me really, really in a bad spot.  I've also got to figure out how to tell my family that I don't need a food police.  I appreciate their concern, but having every decision judged and analyzed regarding food is getting old.  I understand they're just concerned, but its really starting to rub me the wrong way, but thats a topic for another time.


Edit: Thanks everyone for the kinds words and tips.  I've put some of these suggestions into practice already and I'm currently researching which veggies do what in terms of health benefits.  I appreciate all the feedback.

1q19rsk,"High a1c, fasting glucose and overall not happy with blood panel results —is there still hope?","Apologies as this is a long post. 

Hello ya’ll I hope everyone had a very good Christmas and New Years! 


I am a 34 F | 114kg 170cm have been overweight all my life althoughI was a very active althlete even towards collegiate years and lost a bunch of weight on my last year of college. Covid years were not good for me I started gaining weight, living sedentary lifestlye alot of life stuff happened where I became the guardian  of my dad and my father had 2 strokes in a year and later on was diagnosed with early alzheimers. A year ago I was told by my OB that I had a huge myoma and I was confirmed for a dx of PCOS altho in college my then OB told me I was suspect for pcos didnt take it seriously and he left it at that. Given my weight my OB told me to speak to an endo and have my labs done to possibly get prescribed a glp1 to help lose the weight. 

 Low and behold just before christmas my labs came back and it was a shock or basically shouldnt have been a shock? But my panels were all bad except for my thyroid 
My a1c is at an 11 and my fasting glucose was at 223 which is a bit shocking to me as I rarely eat rice or pasta. Maybe from potatoes? Or could be my insulin resistance anyway. Its very scary esp given I live alone and I have to be there for my dad. I hve high anxiety especially after this. i’ve started reading and binging Dr Ekbert, Dr Bikman and Dr Fungs YT videos and reading their books. I’ve already started myself on shifting to a low carb diet and walking 10-15 minutes after every meal and take an evening 30 minute walk per day. Asides from the slight dizziness which I read is temporary and could be from adaptation I am enjoying learning low carb. 

I want to believe there is still hope altho I don’t know anymore.. I havent seen my doctor yet since holidays theyre all on leave and dont come back til Jan 9th so I figured I could start just by fixing what I eat. Since I love veggies shifting to a low carb seemed it for me just to start I feel the keto diet might be too drastic for me to maintain for now. Also started a food journal just so I can really track my food intake as even my peers were shocked to hear the news since even they admit I may be bigger than them but I eat way more healthier. 

I’ve been reading this reddit forum as well throughout my diabetic education binge and when I feel lost and panicking about my situation I get some comfort to read that others have been able to turn their situations around and gives me hope that I could do it too. 

I’d appreciate any sources you could ahare or recommendations you think I should do to help this process esp to those who were able to get their hba1c levels and blood sugars back to healthy maintenance numbers.

1q14wda,Newly diagnosed 27F,"Hi everyone, I'm really glad that I found this community as reading the posts have made me more aware of the consequences of diabetes and the possibility of reversing this disease.


It started when I checked my glucose level at home and got a 7.4, I wasn't entirely shocked because I really love to eat sweet stuff and I've been living sedentarily for a few months now. What prompted the check were a few symptoms, sour taste in mouth after eating something sweet, pinching sensation on legs at night, fats on the back of my neck and fatigue. 


Few weeks later, I went to the pharmacy and did another glucose check and it came out 13.7. This time I was really shocked and immediately all kinds of thoughts came to my head. I felt like my life was over at 27. Then few days back I got a blood test result with HbA1c at 9.2 and glucose at 12.2. All of these were results from fasting after 12 hours. 

Reality hit me of how severe this is and I started medication yesterday. Since getting the results I've been cutting off carbs and sugar and I've been eating  homecooked meals. I really hope this will be effective in bringing down my HbA1c levels because I don't want to live a life of discomfort because of moments of indulgence.


Also just last year (2024) I checked my HbA1c levels and it was 5.6. Back then I used to be little less self indulgent in food and I was exercising 2 to 3 times a week. All that was helping me to control my sugar levels. 


To be honest, since being diagnosed I've been having health anxiety everyday and am afraid that my pressure will rise and I'll get a heart attack and end up in a stroke and I've been a little too aware of how my neck feels or how my arm feels or how my chest feels. But today I distracted myself and today was a bit better. Thanks for reading till here. I hope that all of us will be safe away from this disease and I wish you all a happy, healthy year ahead.

Anyway… I have a problem with my diet. I decided to start little by little, replacing pasta and bread with whole-wheat versions (they don't taste that bad, actually, they're good). I eliminated sugary drinks and now I drink water, unsweetened milk, and unsweetened tea, but I still eat fast food and cookies, brownies, and other things, although I try to eat sweets in moderation. I also have trouble finding foods I like (I have an extreme hatred for vegetables… possibly because of my autism, because they taste bad to me and make me want to vomit for some reason… especially carrots, and now I hate them even more because of the diabetes. I only like lettuce or can tolerate it, so when I can, I try to eat some salad). My numbers are still surprisingly good (every morning my blood sugar is below 100, at night it's usually below 100, and if it goes up, it doesn't matter). The next day it goes down…) I can only prick my finger twice for some reason, and the doctors won't let me use a glucose sensor… This is because of the medications I take: metformin 850mg (one in the morning and one at night) and diamicron 60mg (one in the morning). I also use 16 units of Toujeo insulin (it used to be 22, but my doctor lowered it). I've been like this for three months.

But I'm tired of it. Every day I'm scared something will happen to me. I seriously can't stop thinking about this damn disease every second. I can only relax when my blood sugar is low at night (which it usually is) and I can sleep peacefully. The mental burden this disease carries is huge, especially being young… In fact, I'm still depressed about it.

Lately, I haven't been able to exercise as often because of personal things I won't mention… and I try to do it when I can… I like to go for walks, actually… although with the cold weather because it's winter, it's difficult…

The doctors I spoke to before my last My appointments weren't very helpful. At my last appointment, they barely let me ask any questions. They didn't help me with the trauma of having an incurable chronic illness that could take my sight or require me to have my feet amputated at any moment, nor did they refer me to a nutritionist or anything... or even a therapist. At my last appointment, the doctor I spoke with was kinder. She told me I was improving a little (despite still eating fast food and sweets). I've actually lost weight; I used to weigh 80 kilos and now I weigh 70, an improvement... I suppose.

In my last blood and urine tests, they sent the results to my mom, and my A1C was 5.0, or at least that's what my mom says. Should I be happy?

How did you do in school as an autistic and diabetic person?

At my school (basically a school for autistic children), which is my last year of school, thankfully… I always feel alone because of this condition (I'm the only one with diabetes at school; there isn't even anyone with type 1). Sometimes I don't want to go to school because of it, and I'd rather study at home or something, but I can't… Luckily, my teachers and classmates didn't judge me or anything like that; they were actually concerned. The teachers even told me that if I needed to cry or be alone, I could… I also often talk to a teacher about my struggles with this condition (who, by the way, was kinder and more understanding than most of the doctors I spoke to)…

The truth is… since the diagnosis, I've lost the confidence I had in moving forward and starting my adult life… and I don't know how to cope… I just want to know if there are any autistic people here who have felt the same way and were able to cope.",1767184706.0,9,14,diabetes,diabetes

They used some giant glucose machine that needed what seemed like a gallon of blood and told me it was 120 (it wasn't, I can feel about where my blood sugar is).

They sent me back out to the waiting room, which was filled.  After 2 hours and then not calling a single name, I left.

I know this sounds like I'm in denial but truly, diet-wise, we eat quite healthily. We are both avid cooks so i would say we eat 90% of our meals at home/home-cooked. We're strict with meal planning, we rarely eat red meat or fried foods or fast foods, and he doesn't drink alcohol. I think this is part of why I'm taking this news quite hard. I know areas we need and can improve on though, so I'm already thinking of how to be even more disciplined with our meal prep and diet.

Here are some questions I had for this group:

* Do you use any apps to track your meals or apps that can help identify what foods are low-GI and diabetic-safe/friendly? Thinking about something that can help with packaged things like bread for example. I've been researching and haven't come across an app that catalogs such information.
* Should I invest in a blood glucose monitoring device for him? Any thoughts on traditional finger-pricking method vs CGM devices?
* Doctor currently has him on Metformin but the side effects haven't been too pleasant. With more advanced medications on the market (semaglutides, etc.), is it worth asking his PCP for a change in medication? If you have experience with moving from Metformin to something like Ozempic, i'd love to hear what your thoughts or experiences have been.
* Is there such a thing as being too anxious, especially as someone who is supporting a person living with this diagnosis? I don't want to stress my husband out further, but I want to be prepared and help with this new reality. One of the ways I do this is through cooking and preparing food, and I don't know what's being too restrictive vs being disciplined.

Is all this saturated fat really the culprit behind my type 2 because of the insulin resistance it causes, as the mastering diabetes guys preach, and which there is certainly some research to back up?  I know they propose a vegan diet, and any diet that leaves out, say, fish, to me is suspect and I start thinking they are driven more by ethics than what is optimal.  I think most people will tell you fish is healthy if it isn't contaminated. 

  
But fish aside, Is the answer living on greens, other vegetables, beans, and fruit to reverse insulin sensitivity? Or should I just switch to full on keto and not worry about LDL as long as CAC score isn't concerning? First thing I saw when looking up statins is increased risk of Achilles tears.  That injury will certainly put your exercise routine and therefore your health in jeopardy middle age.

1pyw892,my diabetics foodies: what are we eating?,"For a variety of reasons currently outside of my control or desire, I'm raw-dogging carbohydrates with the assistance of a CGM. Every time I see that line go ↗️ from as little as 20g of carb, I debate whether being fed unflavored Huel with a turkey baster like a foie gras duck is the only way to meet my nutritional needs and, if so, whether life is worth living at all.



So, my fellow diabetic foodies: what's your fanciest, tastiest, maximum-effort low-carb dish that will restore my will to live? 



I'm talking the dish you make from scratch, the showstopper, the one that makes you hit up three different ethnic markets or spice stands. I'm talking whole-food or minimally-processed ingredients, because you can \*taste\* when the ingredient list is made of fractionated foods.



(No shade if you enjoy fractionated food, I'm actually quite jealous. I just.... can't. Protein powder makes me cry. Stevia and monkfruit make me gag. No amount of gaslighting myself that ""it tastes the same"" stops me from being able to taste the difference.)



Bonus points for a vegetarian dish, the true realm of chef creativity. Anyone can make a steak 🥱 but a real chef knows how to make vegetables \*sing.\*



I can go first, even though this will dox me to anyone who's eaten at my house before:

* pepita brittle made with maple syrup, urfa biber, and smoked salt (relatively low carb if you tweak the proportions so that the sugar is juuust barely holding the pepitas together)
* whole cauliflower braised in a saffron, cumin, and turmeric broth, then drained and broiled in the oven until crisp and caramelized. served with a schmear of tahini lemon sauce underneath and a drizzle of balsamic reduction + pomegranate molasses on top, garnished with toasted pine nuts
* double-frozen tofu, squeezed and then quick-marinated in reduced vegetable broth, dredged in an egg batter plus a quick pass in some breadcrumbs or matzoh meal and then deep-fried until crispy. honestly more flavorful and moist than the last time I got chicken wings
* whole milk kefir with smoked salt, cumin, and sumac for a quick savory smoothie (inspired by the masala lassi I had at my local Indian restaurant)
* jerk seitan sloppy joes (without the bun) with a side of coconut-creamed collard greens (shamelessly lifted/adapted from The Post-Punk Kitchen)

  
The only thing that has piqued my interest recently is learning how to make silken tofu from scratch, because it seems fun and also the silken tofu from the store doesn't taste very good.

1pysxe8,Has taking a GLP-1 allowed you more flexibility with your diet?,"Pretty much the post title. For those taking a GLP-1 medication, especially those who are well controlled, has taking a GLP-1 allowed you to feel less paranoid about what you eat?

For context, Dx T2 last year with A1C of 7.1, potential LADA dx in Feb (C peptide is solidly normal). 1000mg of metformin and really yanking it in with diet brought me down to 5.9 at 3 months, 5.8 at 6 and 9 months, and adding 2.5mg tirzepatide brought me down to 5.4. Down close to 30 lbs from weight at dx. Not using insulin, no complications.

I'm still trying to be rigorous about my diet, but seeing the effects of the GLP-1 has helped me relax a little more about food in general. Obviously it's not an excuse to eat whatever whenever, but it's definitely helped me to feel less guilty about having carbs at meals and a treat from time to time. I've always been a foodie and prefer quality over quantity/frequency, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel like I've been ""cut off"" from favorite foods/meals.

I found out I had type 2 diabetes on October 14 after going to the emergency room. My A1C was 8.5, but that honestly wasn’t the part that hit the hardest.

The doctor came in and told me they were going to have to remove my foot.

Long story short: I didn’t know I was diabetic. I didn’t know I had neuropathy. I didn’t know I had an ulcer on my foot — because when you can’t feel anything, you don’t know anything is wrong. Turns out I had gaseous gangrene building up in there.

Luckily — if that’s the right word — I “only” lost two toes.

I spent the holidays learning how to be diabetic overnight, and that was… an experience.

I’m still learning, still adjusting, and honestly still wrapping my head around all of it. I found this group and thought maybe this is where I’m supposed to be now.

1pxpsaj,How do I navigate life from here as a 24 yo?,"I got diagnosed last year in April, it was very difficult to accept, I didn't know any other 23 yo who was diabetic and honestly, a lot was going on. I had recently shifted to a whole new city for my job and I was not ready for that life at all. I missed my mom, had no friends, barely ate or binged till food coma, gained back all the weight that I worked so hard to shed back in college. The doctor assured me that I can go back to being ""normal"" with medication and a good diet+routine and it did work. A1C went from 7.7 to 7. 

Two months later, my mom had a heart attack and I almost lost her. She's my only family and it was scary to a point that I was contemplating unaliving myself if she doesn't make it. Gladly, she did but developed myopathy due to being comatose for a month. We fixed it, it took 6-9 months of hard work but we fixed it (my only achievement in life so far lol). 

However, I relapsed BIG TIME, in context to everything. Depression, PTSD, Anxiety, insomnia, Psychosis, Eating Disorder, Diabetes, everything came back. I was the heaviest I've ever been at 120kgs. Vit. deficiencies, higher ALP levels, Anemia, you name it. Work was so stressful and I was eventually laid off 2 months ago. 

Since a week, I had been feeling dizzy everytime I got up and I knew my blood glucose must be high. When I checked, it was 325 mg/dl post meal. Although I don't trust the doctors here in my hometown, I still went to one and he stated the obvious. 

I'm on medication. The usual has been suggested. Lose weight, eat healthy, dOnT sTrEsS (yea, piece of cake) but I'm really genuinely shitting my pants rn because I've seen what diabetes did to my Mom and I don't ever want to end up like that. She was comatose for a month because diabetes and obesity made it impossible for her to recover from the damage and infection. It's a permanent condition. Remission is very difficult afaik and everything changes. You can't eat rice, potatoes, consume normal milk and paneer (I'm Indian and majority of our staple is made up of foods with a higher GI). I still don't have a job and everything's stressing me out. 

I can work on the weight, the food even till some extend but I don't know how to deal with the anxiety of being a chronically ill person now. I don't know how to apply precision to that aspect. I don't want to live like a patient for the rest of my life, I'm only 24. I've cried so much over it that it's difficult to decide where should I start from? What comes first? Walks? 10k steps?

It's really unfortunate but I do think there's some silver lining to it all. For one, I am *mostly* healthy still. I stay physically active and eat as healthy as I can, only slightly overweight by 10lbs. I workout for a total of an hour a day (30 in the morning, 30 in the evening.) No junk food, fast food, restaurants, I don't drink or smoke. So much so that my blood sugar has already dropped significantly before I received my medication and the doctor even recommended I take it once a day rather than twice. Also while I do still still have to say goodbye to a lot of my favorite meals, I've had experience to limiting my diet before (did keto in the past) and I think if I toughed it out before I can do it again.

TLDR: I have a CGM now which is a bit harder to hide but scared of judgement and shame from family if I tell them I'm T25. But so tired of the hiding and worrying and internalized shame.

They always warned me about my weight (despite literally shelves full of chips and cookies and other snacks) and to eat better (again not great role models). My grandmother is T2 after all the cancer and meds and has been for decades now but they excuse it with all the medical stuff as the trigger.

I'm tired of hiding the truth. Especially now that I started wearing a CGM this fall when I got out on insulin.

It's gotten better and having insulin and trulicity have helped it climb down to a better mid 100 range and sometimes even closer to 100. Haven't had that happen in a couple of years. I want to get back on track just struggling with being burnt out on being T2, struggling with death and existentialism, just burnt on ***life***.

I just needed a place to rant because I *know* my fiance is right that it will be easier if I just tell them. And I know it will be for my sisters' benefit for them to know so they have an accurate understanding of their risk. Even my dad recently admitted sorta that he had a weird incident a bit ago where they had him on insulin temporarily but did not say if diabetic or not, just that it was temporary and it's all better now that he reversed the cirrhosis he got diagnosed with.

Logically, I know I need to face this. My fiance assures me I'll breathe easier and that no matter what, he won't let me be bullied. He'll stand by me and help me stand my ground if need be.

But I'm terrified. And so, so tired. Tired of being terrified tired of hiding it from most people tired of worrying if my sleeve will be long enough and missing my sleeveless shirts and tired of the what ifs making my own denial and hesitation and shame worse... /End rant.",1766861026.0,26,33,diabetes,diabetes

1pw8e9z,Rapid drop in blood sugar,"So we’ve been working on getting my dad’s blood sugar down, using Metformin and also diet. For a while, he’d been dealing with pseudo-hypoglycemia. And we thought it was because we were cutting back on the carbs pretty quickly. But it went on even when his A1C dropped. Doctors weren’t much help; they couldn’t even clue us in on the pseudo-hypoglycemia, it was Reddit and my cousin. 

It wouldn’t happen consistently and soon I figured out it was these blood sugar spikes and crashes. I used to give him some carbs in the morning - usually a piece or two of fruit, a few tablespoons of rice mixed with cauliflower rice, or a hash brown. Carb grams wise it wasn’t much; but sometimes he’d still get the pseudo- symptoms - extreme hunger, grouchiness, overeating. Checking his CGM, his blood sugar wouldn’t get too high, maybe 200-225, but they’d follow with severe drops, and it was in those situations he’d get the symptoms. 

I’d like to not deal with these anymore. One way is to just cut the carbs even more. But mistakes do happen. Is it at all possible that his Metformin has something to do with this? He’s on 500mg XR x two per day. His A1C is in the low 6s (from 8.3) and we have his diet under control for the most part. I don’t want to cut his carbs too much more because he’s at around 50g per day.

1pw5z1k,Emotional Battle with Lows after Surgery,"I developed diabetes last fall as a complication of necrotizing pancreatitis caused by gallstones. For most of this last year it's been not only a physical battle but an emotional battle learning how to take care of myself.

Well around the begging of November, I really began to develop a healthy relationship with my diabetes. I got into cooking most of my meals from scratch with a focus on trying to eat mostly whole or minimally processed foods (without demonizing more heavily processed ones). I really noticed how eating this way made me feel physically and emotionally. My sugars were looking much better. I went from high teens and 20s to being in range (4-7) or a bit above (7-11) without being astronomical.

Well that's when my stomach pain started again. I tried to brush it off as something not so serious. Told myself it's indigestion, gas, acid reflux. Anything but gallstones and maybe pancreatitis again. I mean the pain wasn't even as bad as when I was sick last year is what I kept telling myself.

But I was anxious and deep down knew better. So one particularly painful day, I went to the hospital to get checked out. They found an infection and gallstones but luckily no pancreatitis. I was admitted, placed on IV antibiotics and then consulted to surgery. 

They removed my gallbladder and I returned home. For the first week or so my sugars were out of whack again but eventually they leveled out.

Then this Monday (about 3 weeks after surgery) I began waking up low in the morning. My sugars have been 3.4 to 3.9 everyday this week. And this is where I've started to break down emotionally.

When I first got discharged after my initial diagnosis, I was also an emotional mess. I had very disordered behaviors around food and my diabetes. I believed being low made me a success but there was never any such thing as low enough. And so much more intertwined.

Anyway back to present day. Seeing my recent morning lows has put me on edge and I've been experiencing urges to intentionally make myself low or stay low. It's because somewhere in my brain success has become acquainted with low numbers. In my head low means good. High means bad. 

I haven't acted on the urges and I want to continue to take care of myself. I have been feeling deep shame just for having these thoughts because it feels like the relationship I've built with taking care of my health (diabetes) is slipping away right now.

Disclaimer: I have an endo & an internal med doc I’m working with, but both are a little stumped. I’m not looking for a diagnosis- just looking to see if anyone else has experience with any of the weirdness I’m encountering?

Short background: Slapped a cgm on about a year ago at the advice of my personal trainer. Kept going into the 200s, so ended up seeing an endo. My fasting bg has been in the pre-diabetes range since I was 20 (over 10 yrs), but my retired GP always said no biggie since A1C was always in the 5s. However, the endo agreed that seeing such high spikes after eating was notable since Im fit, active, & young (I’m a personal trainer, so consistent healthy eating & keeping very active is a non-negotiable). 

Blood tests all come back kind of… off? My c-peptide is on the very low end of normal (& has continued to decrease this year), but antibodies for type 1 were negative…. So I’m not Type 1, 1.5, or 2???

Additionally, there are weeks on end that my blood sugars will be in the 200s & even poking into the 300s, but then random weeks it’ll suddenly be solidly under 100 without ANY change to diet or exercise routine (again, I track my food & exercise every day- neurotically lol)…. I’m lost? How can it change so drastically? I get fluctuations are normal even in non-diabetics, but these are huge swings that doesn’t match my eating/ fitness behaviors at all.

I’m on 500mg of Metformin currently & other medical conditions are autoimmune that I take a biologic + Methotrexate for. I’ve noticed some bg fluctuations occur when the autoimmune conditions flare, as well as periods, & weather (hot & cold).

After she was hospitalized for numbers over 900 and not taking her thyroid meds (took a month).  I took over her care.  I live 15 min away and she lives on her own.  We have people by daily and she tries to be active.

Managing her insulin needs went from terrible (hospital had her at a large amount of insulin which caused a lot of crashes) to now,  4 months later.  Up until 3 weeks ago she ate some sugary things daily but her diet wasn't terrible.  I encouraged her to cut most of it and she did.

Fast forward to a week ago.  All of a sudden her insulin needs dropped significantly which caused me to overdose.  I am so worried that I'll either over or under dose her that I am sometimes just staring at the g7 screen looking for patterns and trouble.

My sliding scale is way off, I have no idea what her correction number is, I can no longer determine what to dose her without spending 30 minutes per meal analyzing and digging through chatgpt.

1pv4cvq,Night time lows,"So I have the following problem.

My mother is a T2 diabetic who had a gastric bypass for various reasons in August. 

An issue started up in October where, at night, her sugar would drop. It wasn’t severe, and she could treat it herself. Beginning in November, her sugar dropped below 40 mg/dl (CGM readings) for over two hours in the middle of the night resulting in an ambulance being called and her being dosed twice with glucagon (or whatever brand thy had)

This has happened several more times since and is a nearly every night problem where she can drop over ten points in 5 minutes. She has stopped using her insulin pod entirely, as well as trying to snack before bed.

1pu5tn8,"Normal BMI, active, type 2 54YO","Hello. Finally coming to grips with the fact I'm legit type 2 after a few years of denial. 

My highest weight was around 30 Years old when I was over 200lbs, not eating well, drank a lot of sugar drinks and beer. Growing up ate terribly and inhaled sugar, but never put on weight due to activity levels. Had a bad blood test with high triglycerides around 32, cut out all sugar drinks.  Since then I've been 190lbs or less.

  
2019 blood test, fasted glucose around 95. Last clean one.  

Had a blood test around 3 years ago, fasted glucose was around 150, (no A1C measured) told doctor I hadn't fasted properly (I probably did), he said ""watch the carbs and get another blood test in 3 months."" 

Got another blood test last year, and 24 hour fasted glucose was 135 (early morning dawn effect) and A1C 6.5. Dr wanted me to go on meds immediately, I got a blood glucose monitor and started watching my diet using it. I'm 6 foot and weighed around 190 with last years blood test, but that was the heaviest I've been in 15 years.  I lift weights 2-3 times per week, play an intense cardio sport 1-2 days a week, and walk a few times a week.  I'm 180lbs now and lifting more and heavier than I was then and getting a bit more cardio in as well. I don't have much fat left to lose.  So much of the talk around diabetes focuses on weight loss being part of the equation. I'm probably around 12-13% body fat, so again..not much there to lose. 

During the summer, I was averaging around 5.6 GMI on the libre, which is pre-diabetic..then I stopped using the monitor for a few months, and diet slipped up. Started wearing it again, and fasting morning glucose is just too high, like 130. I've proven incapable of managing my eating without this thing being stuck in my arm yelling at me.  

My doctor mentioned jardiance after I mentioned Metformin. Someone I know said it made them urinate frequently, which I'm already doing as a diabetic and a middle aged man. 

When I refuse deserts at outings, telling people I'm diabetic, they look at me and usually say ""YOU are diabetic? How?"" 

Just posting here to see any others in the same circumstances. I hate the idea of going on meds, but it seems like the thing to do now. I also have high cholesterol, but my calcium score was 3, so not particularly concerned enough about that to start statins also.

I thought everything was fine. I didn't feel off or notice that I was acting differently. But apparently, I scared the people in the allergy shot clinic. I was clumsy and slurring my speech. 


I explained to them that my blood sugar was a little low and that I had had a glucose tablet. It would come up shortly. All my symptoms were just temporary. And I wasn't on drugs or anything like that. 


I was informed that my behavior was inappropriate for the children and other families who were in the shared allergy shot room. And asked not to come in, if I couldn't keep my blood sugar under control and my behavior in order......

Here is my bread machine recipe (i have a zojirushi) which I believe will work in any machine with a dough cycle. 

If you give it a whirl, please let me know what you think!

Low carb pizza dough bread machine version

★★★★

Dinner

Makes 1 x 12 inch pizza (8 slices)

INGREDIENTS

Dry Ingredients

• 1 cup besan (chickpea flour) (92 g)

• ¼ cup vital wheat gluten (30 g)

• 2 tbsp whole psyllium husk (10 g)

• 1 tsp salt

• 1 tsp sugar

Wet Ingredients

• ¾ cup warm water (105–110°F / 40–43°C)

• 1 tsp olive oil

• 1 tsp apple cider vinegar

Yeast

• 1 tsp active dry yeast

DIRECTIONS

1. Add Ingredients to Bread Pan

1. Pour wet ingredients first: water, ACV, olive oil.

2. Add dry ingredients on top: besan, VWG, psyllium, salt, sugar.

3. Make a small well in the center of the dry ingredients (do not reach the liquid) and add the yeast.

This prevents premature activation.

⸻

2. Select the Program

• Choose Dough Cycle.

• Estimated time: \~1 hr 30 min.

• This handles kneading + bulk rise.

Note: Dough will be stickier than typical wheat dough — if machine beeps or struggles, scrape sides once or twice.

Dough will be very sticky so oil hands to remove.

⸻

3. Optional: Cold Fermentation for Sweet Spot Flavor

1. After the dough cycle ends, remove dough from the bread pan.

2. Place dough in a lightly oiled container.

3. Refrigerate 12–24 hours to improve flavor, elasticity, and browning.

4. Remove from fridge 1 hour before shaping.

⸻

4. Shape Pizza

• On oiled parchment, shape into a 12-inch circle (⅛–¼ inch thick).

• Dimple edges slightly for a better crust puff.

⸻

5. Par-Bake

• Bake at 425°F (220°C) for 8–10 minutes until lightly set.

⸻

6. Top & Final Bake

• Add toppings and bake 8–12 minutes until golden and bubbly.

NOTES

Tips for XC-20

• Hydration: Dough may be stickier than wheat dough — add 1–2 tsp water if needed.

• Kneading: Machine may need you to scrape sides once if dough sticks.

• Batch size: Don’t exceed \~2 cups flour per cycle; for doubled recipe, make two batches.

• Freezing: Dough can be frozen after kneading; follow thaw + cold fermentation steps.

Thawing + Cold Fermentation for Frozen Dough

Step-by-Step

1. Thawing

• Remove frozen dough from freezer.

• Keep it tightly wrapped and place in the refrigerator 12–16 hours (overnight) to thaw slowly.

2. Optional Room-Temp Warm-Up

• After refrigerator thawing, let dough sit 30–60 minutes at room temperature before shaping.

• This helps the dough relax and makes shaping easier.

3. Cold Fermentation (Flavor Development)

• If you want the full “sweet spot” artisan flavor, allow a 12–24 hour cold fermentation in the refrigerator after thawing.

• If dough was already frozen after initial kneading (before any rise), this step is crucial to develop flavor.

• If dough was frozen after a short bulk rise, you may only need 6–12 hours to finish flavor development.

4. Shape, Par-Bake, and Bake

• Follow the usual shaping, par-bake, and topping steps.

• Par-bake time may be slightly longer (1–2 minutes) if dough was previously frozen.

⸻

Key Points

• Freezing pauses yeast activity — thawed dough needs time to reactivate yeast.

• Cold fermentation after thawing restores flavor complexity, chew, and rise.

• Dough will behave very similarly to freshly made dough after this step.

1pstx7c,Stomach Bug need BRAT tips,"Please comment no matter your type. I need ideas but food is the last thing I want to think about. 

[Not asking for advice on the sore tummy just foods and self care.]

I have an upset stomach. Its not outrageous like c.diff with 10+ bathroom trips but it's still knocking me around. I'm probably avoiding  food on an already pretty poor appetite during a summer heat wave. I'm not on insulin just ozempic (ceased metformin) until MODY results come in and we transition possibly to a SU. But honestly I feel like If i can't keep my number above the bottom of the range how will I ever handle SU

My question is every time I come close to regular numbers and go normal food I get a worse stomach. So besides gluco-gel and BRAT mostly doing toast and plain pasta as rice for one stores terribly. Aka pasta with no sauce as a sub for rice.

What are some really bland moderate carb foods?
Apples and bananas are the 2 fruits that already upset me so no apple sauce but maybe pear?
I figure root vegetables, straight up pasta, toast, maybe some pumpkin? The fibre seems to work in both stomach extremes.
Also nauseous so avoiding anything really dry or strong aroma.

I have a meter that does sugars and ketones 
I see my CDE tomorrow 
Nutren diabetes formula i can stomach some.
Well meaning family keep saying toast is not sustainable lets eat a bunch of veggies. 
Or  ""but can you do sick day management more than 2 days?""

Also can shitty hydration or electrolyte issues affect the dexcom or is it just the hot weather. Or lets be real dexcom in general.

1psfnhi,Newly diagnosed,"Hi everyone,

I was diagnosed with diabetes on 9th December. The current plan is to start metformin and see how I respond – if it helps, it’s likely Type 2; if not, they’ll look at Type 1. I’ve got my first appointment with the diabetic nurse on 6th January.

My GP said to largely carry on as normal but in moderation – e.g. over Christmas don’t have all the chocolates, just one or two, and when choosing ready meals or takeaways aim for green/amber traffic-light labels rather than red (I’m in the UK).

After reading the Diabetes UK guidance, I decided to go straight to the plate method:

• half the plate non-starchy veg

• quarter lean protein

• quarter low-GI carbs

I’ve cut out sweets and alcohol entirely. The only issue I’m finding is that I’m struggling to get enough calories in – I’m barely hitting 2,000 kcal/day – so I’ve been using a Huel Black shake to add \~400 calories.

My wife is worried I’m not following the doctor’s advice to “carry on as normal in moderation” and that I might be going too hard too fast.

So my question is:

👉 Am I potentially doing myself harm by taking this approach?

👉 Or should I be sticking closer to my old diet, just in moderation, until I’ve seen the diabetic nurse?

I’d really appreciate hearing from anyone who’s been through those first few weeks after diagnosis. Thanks.",1766347427.0,3,15,diabetes,diabetes
1pscw1j,Need guidance on situation; Mom got a stroke due to high blood pressure and diabetes,"TL;DR:

My mom has long-standing Type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 10.2) and recently had a stroke with near-zero mobility, along with a severe carbuncle infection requiring debridement. During hospitalization, sugars were very high (400+) and controlled with insulin. After discharge, sugars were stable briefly but are now running higher again (fasting 140–150, PP 180–200). She’s on metformin and increased sitagliptin, strict diet, and physio only. Trying to understand if this fluctuation is expected during recovery and how best to control sugars without insulin for now.

Hi all, new to this community and already overwhelmed with what a struggle this condition is. My mom got a brain stroke recently on impairing her mobility on the left side arm and leg. It all started with a boil at the center of her back 3 weeks ago. She suffered a stroke 3 years ago which made her lose 20% vision in left eye. In September she started noticing numbness in her left arm which led to restarting blood thinners. But 3 weeks ago when the boil went unnoticed she started to have a lot of pain. 2 weeks later she started having the same problem of left arm being numb again and we got an MRI done. Within a span of 11 hours she wasn’t able to move her left arm and led and we got to know that the boil was a carbuncle because of which her sugar levels shot to 400+ with high BP.

She got admitted to the hospital with insulin shots every 4 hours only to stabilise blood sugar levels after 4 days.

The carbuncle was removed through debridement and we got her home. Since then she’s been on strict diet and regular vital monitoring with daily physio.

Sugar levels had been stable for almost 3 days with fasting being <110 and PP <140

However for the past one week the fasting sugar has been in the range of 140-150 and PP 180-200.

There’s been some change in medication with sitagliptin dose being doubled and metformin being the usual dose.

I’m not sure why the sugar levels haven’t been stable. She’s extremely apprehensive to take meds since long and hence insulin is also something I’m trying to stay away from for now.

I would love to have some guidance on how it can be controlled. Additionally her movement is close to zero with only physio therapy being the physical activity through the day. She’s responding well to physio which I take as a positive sign but I’m afraid the wound of debridement will take long to heal due to diabetes. 

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

1ps7xqv,My 1 year-old son diagnosed with Type 1.,"We noticed that my boy was drinking too much water and suddenly started to pee a lot while sleeping, and we had to change his diapers often. We took him to the pharmacy to run some tests and his blood glucose was 500 mg/dL. His pediatrician told us to rush to a hospital with better infrastructure in another city, 150 km away from ours. It was probably the longest trip I have ever had in my life.

When we arrived, I had to watch three nurses and one doctor try to find a vein in his arms, neck, and head while he cried his lungs out. That was devastating for me. He had to stay in the ICU for three days and then in a regular room for another three days. We learned about diabetes, insulin, and how to administer it. We are trying to adapt now, but my wife is extremely sad. Our 4‑year‑old boy is autistic, so he needs a lot of care as well.

I worry about what it means to teach a child with diabetes. An adult is aware of what to eat, of checking their glucose, of exercising… but for a child, my wife and I are literally his pancreas. Will he understand that at birthday parties he can eat, but not overdo it? Will he feel very different from the others? These are a father’s worries.

Right now, I check his glucose every night at dawn. We are still in the period of adjusting his insulin dose. The sensors are not recommended for his age, but I will try to use the Libre 2 Plus that is sold here in Brazil anyway. I will do everything possible to ensure that my child has the best quality of life.

Lowered it down to a 6.2 this December, and hoping to lower it down to somewhere in the 5s. 

Mid-September I suddenly developed a bloody floater, one that moves around whenever I move my eyes, like something gloopy. My mistake was that I didn't get to do the retina exam immediately because I've been busy with work. I only got time to do the exam this December... where I saw major bleeds in both eyes! The doctor who saw my scans said I'm for a vitreoctemy since there was severe hemorrhage and tiny blood vessels, and that laser wouldn't seal off ALL the membranes.

I couldn't schedule any consultation with that retina specialist this December since it's the holidays, and his next available schedule is on January 10th. Absolutely insane.

2. They've denied my PA for Mounjaro claiming about 5 different things everytime we've submitted one with an excuse of - we didn't get the chart notes OR you're not in the insurance (which is wild because I've never had anything else for insurance).

Anyway, today I put on my CGM and I'm curious if anyone knows why my data looks like this? Granted I've never fingerpricked myself at 1am (2:30am as I write this), but it looks like I am exceptionally HIGH for it being nighttime and it seems to be climbing.
I don't know what I'm expected to do if I have highs overnight.
I fingerpricked myself and it's 143 (at the time of writing this). I know CGMs are logging over time, and the current reading is behind what it would be if I picked my finger, but I'm definetly trending upward overnight. 
My provider recommended this CGM because my insurance was being a pain.
I'm going to ask my provider after another day and night's worth of data, but this doesn't seem like something I can even control. 
Even before this, I'd be below 170 when I checked manually. Even during the day, between 1hr and 2hr after a meal (I was checking a lot to get a ton of data). I only spiked to 180 yesterday for a period of time after dinner and it wasn't for very long because I have to take my metformin with food (or I get bad GI issues, even on ER). 
I'm currently only on 1000mg of ER Metformin (because my insurance sucks and so I'm doing over the counter semaglutide per my provider).

Am I going crazy? Could all my past ""highs"" be over night while sleeping and I have no control over it?
I was diagnosed after an A1C of 11.2. I have PCOS (with insulin resistance) and Hashimotos (Thyroid Autoimmune Disorder). Has anyone else had their glucose do this? Is this a common thing for Type 2? 

I'm just really confused and concerned that before the metformin and my diagnosis, I was having highs at night that were out of my control and lead to a high A1C when everything else (this is prior to me poking my fingers) was possibly normal and in range when I was awake.

I was shocked that I had an A1C of 6.8. I haven’t gotten a call from my healthcare provider for the next steps, but am definitely going to be taking it seriously. 

That being said, would it be beneficial to get a finger prick glucose monitor to go ahead and start tracking my blood sugar while waiting for next steps? I’m not sure how their schedule will be during the holiday season and definitely want to start making the right choices.

1pqmpvy,"Switching from type 2 to type 1, Lada","

So yesterday I received my lab results. 

I was diagnosed I had type 2 diabetes a couple years ago, and I was put on a couple different medications by my primary care one of them ended up hitting me into dka.

Now, my endocrinologist that I picked up while in the ICU from that thought I was type 1 because type 2 normally does not go dka. However the blood work came back with none of the autoimmune antibodies and my body was still producing insulin. At the time I was 32.


Fast forward a few years to present day and we are still battling overnight blood sugar spikes. PA of my endocrinologist order another round of lab just to take another one. The results came back again yesterday. My body is no longer producing its own insulin has not reading came back as less than 0.1. The antibodies that attack against the production were at over 100.

I have yet to hear from my immunologist as I get copies of the lab work as soon as they're available and he has not yet had a chance to review them. However, I am familiar enough I am looking at.

The good news is my blood sugar is mostly under control even now with an A1C of 6.7. I know this is going to have a few changes and at 34, I can't believe I'm going to admit this to a bunch of strangers on the internet, it's both reassuring and terrifying.

I say that as before I became a diabetic, 5 years ago, I was 360 lb. When I received my diabetic diagnosis, I'd already got myself down to 260 lb. And I still have people saying that my diabetes was because I was overweight. I'm currently down to 240 lb and I know now as of the realization this morning at the diabetes was not caused by my weight. However, switch from a type 2 to a type 1 is a lot of unknown, just as I was getting used to the idea of being type 2.

So, I'm hoping, I can get some insight on this and what I can expect in any change whatever finally been used to.

1pqdafo,Sigh... I hoped this wouldn't happen,"Short history:

I was diagnosed as a T2 diabetic about a dozen years ago.  For the first six-seven years or so, I was in denial and ignored it.  Getting an A1C of 10.5 was a wake-up call for me, and I became very good about managing my diabetes.  Tested myself religiously several times a day, watched what I ate, and got my A1C down to the low six range.  This continued for about two years.

In early 2023, I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  At that point, due to the chemo, I was able to eat very little, and I couldn't deal with fighting battles, so I let the diabetes one go in order to concentrate on the cancer.  I didn't eat terribly (diabetes-wise) during that time (I couldn't really eat too much anyway).  My A1C rose to the low sevens during this time.  In Aug 2024, I went on Gemcitabine/Abraxene and reacted well to it.  I began to be able to eat again and didn't feel horrible, and so I began monitoring my diabetes again.

In July, I had surgery where my tumors were removed (along with my spleen and half my pancreas).  Because I now have half a pancreas, I am now on insulin to manage my blood sugar and have a CGM to monitor myself.  In October, a tumor reappeared, and today I had my first chemotherapy since surgery.

With chemotherapy, I also receive steroids.  From experience, I knew that the steroids caused my blood sugar numbers to shoot up.  When I had steroids, I knew that I could easily hit a 300 without trying too hard (when I had my full pancreas).  

I consulted with my endocrinologist to prepare for the steroids that come with chemo.  She advised me to take 10 units of long-acting when receiving the steroids, and she told me to increase the amount of fast-acting that I take before meals and for correction. 

As you can see, despite my best efforts, I failed.  I woke up at about midnight (steroids started at about 3 PM) with my Dexcom reading ""HIGH"" (this means over 400).  I pulled out my fingerstick device and got a 418.  

OK, maybe that wasn't so short...

In any event, I know this is a learning process, and that I'll use this experience to be able to better handle next week's chemo (blood-sugar wise).  But I'm still disappointed in myself.  Perhaps it's because my dinner choice wasn't the best (2 tuna sandwiches on low-carb whole wheat bread). -From past experience, I know I can normally handle this, but I guess in combination with the steroids, even the extra insulin wasn't enough.  

Anyway, I just wanted to vent a bit.   I'm going to consult with my endocrinologist again before next week's chemo (only six days away) and see if we can come up with a better plan.   Thanks for listening.

It’s been a little over a month since diagnosis. I knew nothing about the disease when I found out. 

I knew so little that when the doc said I’d take insulin “one time” I actually thought they’d give me a shot and that would be it. Then I realized he meant one time per day. 

I am fortunate that needles don’t bother me. From my first finger prick and first injection, I was fine. 

I also thought that I would be down to normal glucose numbers in a matter of days. Yet the readings fluctuate between very high and normal all throughout each day. Fasting has yet to be at a normal number.  Yet I’ve been very good as far as not touching carbs. My daily food intake consists of pepperoni slices, cottage cheese, eggs, and Glucerna shakes.

1pqarjd,Worried about new medication.,"
Hello, how are you? I have type 2 diabetes. I’m a bit worried. I spent a long time without taking care of my diabetes. I got a new doctor 4 days ago. My A1C came back at 9.3. My doctor prescribed me 3 tablets of metformin 850 mg per day and 3 doses of NPH insulin, 15 units each time. At the beginning of treatment my fasting glucose was 190, and today, four days later, it was 87 two hours after dinner and kept dropping. After having already eaten dinner, I then ate a ham and cheese sandwich with whole wheat bread, a sugar-free yogurt, and a glass of chocolate milk as a last resort (all spaced 30 minutes apart), and my reading went down to 83.  

My question is: has anyone experienced their readings changing so quickly? Could I get hypoglycemia if I go to sleep with readings of 83? My appointment with my doctor isn’t until December 29, but I’m a bit scared by how fast my readings are dropping. I’m eating complex carbohydrates and not skipping meals, and I’m also consuming a lot of fiber and protein. Does anyone think the amount of medication is too much?  

I’m not saying I would change the amount of medication on my own, nor am I asking for advice on that, but maybe it would be a good idea to see another doctor before December 29?

I spoke to a assistent doctor and decided to take Metformin, 1000 mg (mga), I also changes my eating-regime. No added sugar anymore. As a result of my changed life style and medicins my bloodsuger is dropping and as a result of this my vision changed. I now have glasses (+2) as I cannot read the laptop and books anymore.

1ppakod,"Newly diagnosed Type 2, very severe, finally got my Ozempic but also just got sick","Hey all,

A couple months ago, I went to the walk-in (my primary doctor retired that same day) to get some distressing health stuff checked out (still have the actual screening but looks good so far) and got my blood drawn. Most of my levels were completely normal except my cholesterol was a little high, protein a bit too high, and my a1c was a whopping 10.7 with a 285mg glucose level.

It was hard to gage how serious that is until someone at the clinic personally called me and urged me to be seen and establish a new primary care right away. This was mid November so less than a week before Thanksgiving. 

They scheduled my new doctor a 30 minute consultation that was basicslly just supposed to be introductions, and I naively didn't ask for it to be extended. It was basically him madly typing prescriptions and notes into his computer, and getting referrals sent in because I had 3 other concerns to varying degrees besides that. 

While just how bad it sounds like it is shocked me, I wasn't too surprised as I was diagnosed prediabetic in 2016, but with drastic lifestyle changes that I gradually dropped over time that diagnosis was overturned my very next visit and I would semi regularly get my blood checked and not have anything alarming come back. Diabetes runs in both sides of both sides of my family, so I am quadruple genetically dispositioned for it. 

All of this to say I have basically had to manage full blown type 2 diabetes for an entire month as just today my insurance decided to cover my Ozempic after fighting with my doctor on it this whole time. Denying coverage several times. I have been subsisting off of basically only berries, 2 eggs in the morning (with bacon bits and shredded cheese), sometimes chicken in the evenings/hot dogs with keto buns (then found out about the protein and cholesterol thing and stopped), apples, and occasionally some popcorn or other snack in moderation. Plus baby carrots for if I'm extra hungry

I don't know whether it is covid or just a nasty cold but I got horrifically sick yesterday (coughing mostly with chills, runny/stuffy nose, fever). Is it okay to start now, or should I wait until I'm not/less sick? I have a sensitive stomach so probably throwing up regardless but I am taking as many precautions as I reasonably can right now lol. On the other hand I'm also worried that my diabetes has been unchecked for so long and weighing getting started on it regardless although I am REALLY not looking forward to feeling worse than I already am.

1por5tr,What does it look like if a CMG is giving false lows?,"My husband was diagnosed with type 2 a couple of months ago and had a Libre CMG for a week which seemed to give the sort of readings we'd expect. He's just got a new one, and its been giving low levels for the last 24 hours - they haven't changed significantly after eating normal meals, drinking juice or eating dried fruit, however they have still been fluctuating. He doesn't have a finger prick monitor so we can't use that to check.

There seem to be two possibilities: 
1. His medication dose is now too high and is keeping his sugar lower than desired (his dose hasn't changed, but perhaps his sugar control is better than when he first started meds, so he needs a lower dose?)
2. The CMG is giving inaccurate low readings. I know it's possible for this to happen, but I'm wondering what that actually looks like on a graph - is it likely that it would stay consistently low but still go up and down (between 54-89), or would it typically give accurate readings with occasional false lows?

My husband has contacted his doctor, but while he waits for a reply, I'm hoping someone on here can tell us about their experiences if they've been through something similar.

I recently started wearing a my G7 again after a min of not wearing it. I had recently reached urgent lows several times in one day for hours and came to Reddit to ask abt it. Everybody said to use a meter to double check it’s an actual low. I tried it with my CGM at home and it read 98. 

I bought another meter today the freestyle libre precision neo one. It read very similar to my CGM compared to my previous meter. I threw that meter out but I heard many people say different things about different CGMs and meters idk if I should invest in switching for both.

1pnnrff,Newly Diagnosed and Confused,"I (24F) was diagnosed T2 in October 2025, and since then it's been kinda a roller coaster. My A1C was 11.5 when I got the bloodwork done, and so my doctor (who is great, so if anyone has ideas on what to ask for in terms of tests, that would be great) said - lets start you on Mounjaro. He gave me a sample of Ozempic (he doesn't have Mounjaro in his office).

Now, I'm new to the whole thing as a diabetic myself, but my dad is a T2D as well. 
Now, my dad's sugar; I've seen it be as high as 300 before when he was getting it under control. 
But for me, I never go out of range. 
I'm even currently fighting my insurance for medication coverage and so I've been off the Ozempic sample for two weeks and its just me and my metformin ER pushing through until my insurance pulls its head out of its butt. 

My blood sugar, with the Ozempic trial and even off my medication has never been out of range. I'm usually high in the morning when I wake up (about 115-125) and then once I get up and get to work (which is when I eat breakfast and take my metformin) - my glucose is down (90-100). 
My highest read has been 189, but that was some poor decisions with food the first or second day since my diagnosis. I've never gone above 170 otherwise. 

I'm really confused how I would be averaging 200-300 with an A1C at 11.5, but not have spikes (despite not having my medication because insurance sucks).

Anyone have any suggestions? My husband and I are floored when I check my numbers (about every 2hrs until my cgm comes in so I can be informed) at how low they are when my doctor is expecting me to be averaging high...
Am I needing other testing done? What should I ask for? 
I have an autoimmune disorder (Hashimotos) and it's been not nice to me (in terms of blood work), and I've got PCOS. 
Could this be a different type of diabetes or something else? I'm really unsure what I should be asking for/researching to take to my provider and ensure everything is documented the way its supposed to be.

1pnlown,What's going on with my father-in-law's blood sugar.,"Hello,  I'm not seeing medical advice per se, but more guidance and ideas because we're at a loss and the closest appointment he could get is not till the middle of January.

My Father in law was diagnosed with type 1 a couple of years ago in his mid 60s. Since then he constantly has issues managing his blood sugar. He doesn't seem willing to change his eating habits too much, ""I'll just insulin for it"" and eats what he wants. I've told him that insulin is not like confessional, it doesn't wipe away your sugar sins (unless I'm wrong in that assumption). Something he either doesn't understand, or doesn't want to.  He does TRY to adjust his eating, but it's pretty inconsistent.

He had a scare about a year ago when he forgot his insulin and went on a trip with his wife. He ended up in the hospital with a count of 700. They got his sugars down and he seemed to take it seriously. But his lack of change to his eating shows me that he really isn't

To the current issue, the last several weeks his blood sugar has been all over the place even though he has been dosing the appropriate amount, and even over in a couple of cases to see if that changed anything.  Typically he's in the high 100s to the low/mid 200s. He'll spike to the mid 300s pretty consistently after eating even after his dose . Eventually it will very slowly return to the 200 range and chill there.

So, my questions. Any ideas what could be causing the spikes after eating? Is that actually normal even with insulin? I know a ""healthy"" blood sugar is below 100 or so, any reasons to be concerned that he is typically still in the high 100 to 200s several hours after eating anything? 

Again, not looking for medical advice or anything but just some guidance from some folks that have been dealing with this longer than he has. Any advice is welcome. Thank you!",1765839306.0,0,19,diabetes,diabetes

TLDR: Any real solutions to manage the symptoms of neuropathy?

I was diagnosed about 18 months ago. My eye doctor noticed I had diabetics macular edema (later diagnosed as diabetic retinopathy). This led to the quick diagnosis, My a1c was ~13. 
I completely revised my diet (typical low carb, minimal sugar; high fiber, high protein) combined with Metformin and tests of trulicity (side effects for me) ended up on ozempic. A1c is now 5.5. 
All that said. Retinopathy is a forever thing; I’ll probably get injections in my eyes forever… I do get them less now (went from every 4 weeks to every 7 weeks). 

But. The neuropathy. It is maddening. The cold, tingles, shooting pain, deep itching. It’s in my hands and my feet. My feet are now mostly numb, which sucks - foot care is terrifying. 

Docs have me taking gabapentin. I have a referral for an EMG (Electromyography) nerve test; but the test locations are severely backlogged, I won’t be tested until mid next year.

I was supposed to be celebrating my anniversary yesterday. Instead, my sensor failed out of nowhere and my boyfriend and I had to leave in the middle of our plans to go home so I could put in a new sensor. Dinner rolls around 4 hours later and the new sensor fails. I eat without knowing my bloodsugar and miss a low before it's too late and spend most of the evening laying on the couch trying to get my bloodsugar back up without overdoing it. I put in a new sensor  before bed and it keeps me awake all night screaming that I'm LOW. I'm aware of compression lows, I don't roll onto my arm, and my bloodsugar ranged from 90-130 all night. I don't calibrate it because I've heard it can cause the sensor to fail, so it keeps screaming and waking me up every hour so I can manually check because I'm blind to lows and I'm too scared to turn the alarm off.

I wake up and it's off by over 50 points. I finally break and decide to calibrate it. It doesn't take my calibration. Three hours later the sensor fails.

I will not sleep tonight again. I will not have an accurate reading today again (new one booted up and is already wildly off). I have friends coming over today and will not be able to have a drink with them (don't want to miss a low overnight esp while drinking) or comfortably know when my number sit while we're in town.

These sensor failures have interrupted business trips and important meetings. They have interrupted important plans and time spent with people who are important to me. I feel like they're effecting my mental health at this point.

1pmj8y3,I HATE the Stelo...,"I used the Libre for over a year, mostly successfully.  It was not without its share of issues, mostly mechanical ones where something internal would glitch or the adhesive would fail (I frequently had to use a Tegaderm sheet to protect them.)

\[Before anyone asks, yes, I did try Skin Glu. I don’t know what I was doing wrong, but I tried it with three Libres and they all failed upon placement every time, usually with the wire bending/breaking.\]

Then, earlier this year, I changed jobs and got new insurance that didn’t cover CGMs at all.  My doctor recommended I switch to Stelo because they didn’t require a prescription and would be a little cheaper with the subscription.

I started the subscription and got my first round.  Since I was paying for these out of pocket, I decided I wanted to take the extra step of a more durable overpatch.  I found [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5BH9RQY) on Amazon- they're similar in material and stickiness those Band-Aid Tough Strips.  There's a rigid plastic cap that goes over the sensor and then you put the whole patch over it.

Got the sensors.  First of all, application is terrible.  The Libre, you put it on the outside of your upper arm, towards the back, but still into the muscle (below the deltoid, I believe?)  Generally, I had no issues with this, at least none that the actual placement site would cause.

The Stelo goes into the underside/back of your arm, but still somehow in a place that isn't going to get bumped, pressed, or laid upon?  I'm a sidesleeper, so that's a problem.  Not only that, but it's supposed to go into into the soft, fatty part of your arm.  It's like nailing Jello to a tree, or in this case, maybe more like nailing a tree to Jello.    
  
And it's such an awkward position to try to get into by yourself.  I think it was hard to have the applicator totally flat/parallel to the plane of my arm in the spot it had to go, and so when I launched it, it didn't make a smooth connection.  The little strip of adhesive around the edge was all wonky and uneven.  The overpatch that they give you doesn't make it that much more secure, so I was glad I got those overpatches.  

But within 36 hours, I discovered that because it didn't make a perfect connection upon first being applied, it wasn't really planted correctly and I stopped getting readings.  I was really frustrated.  It hurt like hell to take it off.  I think when it stays on for 10-15 days, the adhesive gradually loosens and by the end of its lifespan, it comes off easier.  Well, when it's only been on for a day or two, that adhesive is still full-strength and you're ripping it off the soft, delicate skin on the underside of your arm.  I literally cried because it felt like I was ripping my skin off (no actual bleeding, fortunately.)

I gave up on them for awhile.  I admit, I hate needlesticks, it had been forever since I had done them, and I wasn't monitoring myself at all for those months.  At my last endocrinologist appointment, she understood but gave me a little pep talk and said to try again.

I'd kinda forgotten about it, but I have an appointment with her in a couple weeks, so I decided to give it another go.  Re-watched the video about how to do it and put it on.  Thought I found the firmest part of the underside of my arm.  Put it in.  Seemed like it went ok.  Connected it to my phone.  The timer countdown started and like two minutes later, it stopped and said the session ended early and I needed to replace the sensor....uh, what?!?!    
  
When I took it off, again I was in tears, even after holding a damp washcloth on it to try to soften it.

What kind of sadist designed this thing??

I'm going to talk to my endocrinologist at my appointment.  Maybe I'll consider an alternative placement site- I think my thigh would be good.  I would also consider the Eversense, the one-year implanted sensor, but it seems like you have to take insulin specifically to do that one?  I take Ozempic.

Anyway, if neither of those options work, I might go back to the Libre and pay out of pocket.  If anyone in the Chicago area likes the Stelo and wants to buy a three-month supply from me, DM me...

1pmheo2,Found a good snack!,"I travel a lot for work, so having something mostly ""non-perishable"" I can keep in the car that won't spike me to high heaven is a necessity. A necessity that I haven't been able to find until now. 

I had this at a client's house and my BG only went up 30 points. (Considering WATER will raise my BG by 30 minimum, this is a huge win for me.) It fits the 2-to-1 carbs to protein ratio (technically 2-to-1.5, or 1-to-1 if you count the fiber for net carbs, so even better) that I've had the best results with shooting for. It doesn't have a strong aftertaste that a lot of these products do. AND, for someone who has a really hard time with breakfast like me, it is small enough that it didn't feel like a chore to eat.

I’ve never taken anything for this before. 

I wonder if I should try again to correct this with extreme diet and excercise. it seems like I don’t have much wiggle room to deviate at all, if so eat a granola bar I spike to 200.

1pl1049,"Do you trust nutrition facts labels, or weigh your food to count carbs more accurately?","I don't have diabetes myself - I work at a grocery store and have an interest in food science, and I often inspect the products we carry to assess whether the stated weights/serving sizes are accurate. Recently, I bought a cinnamon bread loaf that stated 1 serving as a 59g slice, but each slice actually weighed 42g. This deviation was concerning - I found that the discrepancy overstated the carb content of each slice of bread by 10g (the purported 59g slice would have 32g carbs, but the actual 42g slice had 22g of carbs). Since some people have an insulin to carb ratio of 1 unit per 10g carbs, this could cause a diabetic person to take an extra unit of insulin, which is potentially dangerous. I'm not familiar enough with insulin dependence to know just how dangerous though - do you normally weigh your food to make sure the actual weight matches the serving size weight?

So I have extremely high tolerance to low blood sugar. I often times don't get symptoms until low 50's to low 40's mg/dl. Dangerous right? Well I once went down to 24 mg/dl and somehow I was still functioning, glad for that because I really didn't want to die 

HOWEVER 

How is it that I can have such a high physiological tolerance for low blood sugar to the point my body doesn't even give me symptoms until way too late yet I have an unconscious psychological defense system. When I go low in my sleep, I dream of going low and it jolts me awake, effectively saving my life. Don't get me wrong I am grateful for that, I rather not have this stupid disease be the thing that kills me and I know many people don't have that luxury 

BUT it still confuses me. When I'm awake my body outright ignores low blood sugar for a long time but when I'm asleep it jolts me awake? How does that even work.

And how am I supposed to feel about it? On one hand I'm grateful for the dream defense mechanism but on the other hand I'm furious I do t get symptoms until I'm THAT low.

I was wondering if people could tell what to expect and give me suggestions on what to ask for.  I am going to start insulin for the first time and most likely type 2 - but I should probably ask to check for LADA, I am assuming....  As for insulin, I'm assuming it likely be slow acting 1x a day injection or but I am hoping I can request a continuous glucose pump to be set up with in combination with this even as a type 2.   Do you guys recommend any other tests or blood markers to make the visit more thorough and complete?  Any scans for radiology to check for damage? It would be nice to see beta cell dysfunction vs insulin resistance but I don't know if I can request that on first visit. 

  
I guess they will adjust it through time after I start taking the insulin for a while, but starting something new is always daunting.  Initially I had hoped to take metformin only and work on my diet/ exercise but doctor really thinks I need insulin.   If you want to share a brand name that you have liked (or disliked) and why, that would helpful to draw from just for perspective.  Any issues with continuous delivery or even bad experiences with hypoglycemia, especially when sleeping at night or really any issues with any brand or delivery method would be helpful.

  
I am over 50, adult male by the way.  Some dizziness and behavioral changes in the last few months led me to get the blood test which showed the high A1c as well as high LDL-c.  Now I am just hoping to get as complete a picture a possible and see get ahead of things.  I get nothing is medical advice here but any personal experiences or recommendations would be so appreciated.

I went to the hospital last week with alot of symptoms of high blood sugar  and pharmacy testing at 31.1. They sent me home 2 days later at 17.1 with a prescription for 8 units of long  and 4 units of fast every meal

I have been eating alot cleaner this week basically cut off sugar and barley touched bread, (hardest part, I love my baked goods) but I am having a hard time managing blood sugar. When I take 4 units I have been going too low at night and in morning. most of the day im at around 9-12 until before dinner I go around 5-8.

My diet this last week has mostly consisted of hard boiled eggs for breakfast. 
Salad and protein with cucumber and hummus for lunch
And dinner has been protein veg and salad
Barley touched coffee because I'm scared of blood sugar spiking.

The food part is going to be the hardest part, I used to eat fairly decent but definitely enjoyed things like bread, sweets like chocolate and baked goods and something greasy every now and then and now feel like I can't eat any of this anymore comfortably

I'm obviously new to this and have received basically no support or training from a Healthcare professional and have to wait 3 months to meet with a diabetes management specialist.

1pkhzcu,Question about possible early LADA patterns (GTT tomorrow),"Hi everyone,

I just want to say upfront that I’m not looking for a diagnosis or self-diagnosing. I’m being followed by my doctors and I have a GTT scheduled for tomorrow. I’m mainly here to hear other people’s experiences or general insight while I wait. I’m specifically asking about LADA.

What’s confusing for me is that my sugars aren’t consistently high. Most of the time they fluctuate in a strange way rather than staying elevated. I’ve only had a few true hypoglycaemia episodes (about 3 in the last 2 months), but more often I notice that my glucose rises later after eating and then drops earlier on. For example, my pre-meal reading might be around 5.4, then about an hour later 4.0, and then closer to 2 hours later 6.6. My fasting morning sugars are usually around 5.1–5.7 mmol/L.

Along with that, I’ve had very low C-peptide, some ketones, weight loss, nausea/fatigue, and other autoimmune things. Thyroid issues have been ruled out. Diabetes-specific antibody tests are still pending. I know this could be many things other than LADA, so I’m not assuming anything.

I also understand that reactive hypoglycaemia by itself doesn’t mean LADA. I’m just wondering if anyone here experienced mixed, delayed, or non-typical glucose patterns early on, before things became clearer.

If you’ve been through this, I’d really appreciate anything you’re comfortable sharing about how things started for you, what testing looked like, or anything you wish you’d known earlier.

I've managed to make a lifestyle change and stick to a fasting window which has really helped stabilise my blood sugar and it's a routine I definitely feel I can stick to.

Now with that under control, according to my CGM, when I eat my meal my blood sugar will peak to just around 180mg/dL which is in the green range, and then will slowly taper down to around 135mg/dL as I'm getting to bed. When I wake it sometimes may rise to between 140-160 even without food. I think this is down to the Dawn Phenomenon and perhaps the stress that I have in my job. Even still the CGM is still in the green despite these high readings.

And then it will slowly go lower to around 90mg/dL near to the end of my work shift at 5pm. Sometimes after work I will have a quick gym session before coming home and it may rise to 120 with a fasted brief workout (weights only, maybe around 6-10 sets)

Once home I will open my fasting window and eat food, which can vary day by day but my blood glucose will rise usually to a maximum of 180mg/dL - which is still in the green on my CGM, and then the cycle will repeat.

My question is this routine ok to eliminate risks of diabetes side effects. Is having my blood glucose around 180mg/dL safe? It seems high to me but shows up as green on the CGM.

Is it dangerous to have these spikes to this level or should I aim more to be keeping a stable blood glucose of around 95mg/dL consistently and aim to keep it around that even after my single meal?

1pkbkzo,Feeling like I need to hide my diabetes,"My dad and I are both T2D. Mine came on from insulin resistance due to PCOS and my other autoimmune diseases. 
I'm fairly new to the T2D world (in terms of being the one with T2D). 

My dad is pretty open with me about it. He and I both have talked about things and I feel good about talking about with him (my mom passed in June, so its just him and I and we're all each other has).

I'm getting a CGM from my provider because even only 3 months into diagnosis and I'm tired of fingersticks.

I get warm quickly. My body is terrible at thermoregulating and I can be super warm or super cold. 
I typically wear a tank top all day, and keep a sweater or jacket on me for when I do get cold, but I'm worried about having a CGM around my coworkers. 
I know most people wouldn't give it any thought, but my coworkers can be nosy people. 
I could just say ""I'm not talking about my medical information with you."" (We work with HIPPA - I'm not disclosing my health information for them) BUT. I know there are coworkers who won't leave things alone and I'm not sure how I should go about wearing my CGM. I can wear a sweater most of the time, but like I said - I tend to run hot. 

How did others feel about it wearing a cgm? I know people probably aren't going to ask, but I'm more worried about everyone just putting their opinions out there about my T2D diagnosis and getting a ton of unwanted advice. ",1765493587.0,11,33,diabetes,diabetes

1pk6cxw,"WIBTA if I told my students ""no food gifts""?","**TL;DR**: First year back in the classroom since dx and I worry my students will give me chocolate/sugar treats since that's been mostly my experience in the past. Do I tell them not to?



**More context:**

This past birthday in Sept I was given an entire basket of ""low sugar"" foods. I always appreciate the thought when someone goes out of their way to do/get something for me. But I won't lie and say I was disappointed that my birthday gift was entirely focused on eating; something I actually really hate doing now. 

Next week is our final week of classes before our winter break. I teach elementary, and it's pretty common for students to bring gifts for their teachers. In previous years I've been given boxes of chocolate and other treats. I would keep some because at the time I enjoyed it, and gave the rest of it away to friends/family. 

This year I'm so tempted to go in tomorrow and tell them ""please, no food related gifts"". But then it comes across like I assume: 

1. they're going to get me something (not all students do - which is totally fine). 

2. If they've already picked it up to give to me that I'll be ungrateful if it is food. I do *not* want them returning anything. 

I fear I've left it a little late for this conversation. I might just bite the bullet and accept the food related gifts and give it all away over the break. 

I should also point out that no kiddos know my dx. One parent does, but other than that only staff I am close with know.

Thoughts? If you are a parent, and your child's teacher said this, what would that make you feel? Am I overthinking things? (hint: probably). ",1765480881.0,0,27,diabetes,diabetes

My cholesterol and has amazing and my blood pressure is under control thanks to the medication and and diet.  I don’t do anything special for diet just basically watch what I eat and portion control and I have cut down on my soda.  I definitely don’t do diet.  My mom has been Type 2 for a couple years and it runs crazy in my moms side of the family so she has been guiding me.  She is super proud.  I have also lost 22 pounds.  I am actually quite proud of myself as well.  When I was first diagnosed I was so afraid.  I don’t think I could do it.  I was like I don’t care I’ll eat what I want and have all my limbs amputated.  My husband was like then I’ll leave you.  Lol.  He was joking.  He has been extremely supportive and has been on this road with me.  I’m not just hear to tell about my journey.  At one of my recent appointments my doctor suggested getting a flu shot.  She said she doesn’t have any agenda or trying to sway me any way but she did say that with diabetes no matter how fantastic my numbers are if I get the flu it can get really bad.  I told her I would definitely think about it because there was a time that I did get the flu shot every year but then I would get the flu some years and then I stopped because I just didn’t wanna deal with the flu.  I haven’t gotten the shot the past seven years and I haven’t gotten the flu but I do know that diabetes can weaken the immune system.  Earlier this year in January so almost a year ago I got pneumonia.   I asked her about the pneumonia shot.

Problem is I can’t get it to connect and Google just tells me to try everything I’ve already tried. Still won’t do it.

I have:
Reset the pairing process 

“Forgotton” the device through my Bluetooth settings.

Turned Bluetooth off and on 

Turned the phone off and on 

Shut down my YpsoPump application and relaunched it 

Ensured the “cradle” is inserted correctly

Made sure the YpsoPump application is the ONLY application that will connect to the G6 thing 

Inserted a brand new sticky site thingy with the needle in it

I just finished by pump choice and I had a question to bring up to my NHS diabetes team about if it's okay to use my penfill cartridges of lyumjev to either:

A) Move lyumjev from penfill to a vial (essentially refilling existing cold insulin vials since they'll never be out the fridge for more than 10 minutes)

B) Move lyumjev from penfill directly to a pump by using a syringe and sucking all the insulin out of the penfill.

They told me they do not recommend me doing any of them, and only use the vials once you have them on prescription. The issue is, I have like 30-40 lyumjev cartridges spread out across multiple locations (friends, gf, work) and I don't want to waste the insulin.

Apparently it's something to do with keeping it sterile but as long as I use fresh needles and clean the penfill with some alcohol it should be fine, no?

1pjdl1c,"Newly diagnosed, confused about type & doctor’s advice — need input","Hi everyone,  
I’m a 30M from Canada, diagnosed with diabetes at the end of August with an HbA1c of 12.7.  

- I immediately changed my lifestyle: quit smoking, started strength training + daily walks.  
- My doctor first prescribed Metformin 500 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, then switched me to Sitagliptin/Metformin 50/1000 (1 tab for a week, then twice daily).  
- After 1 month, my HbA1c dropped to 9.8 and my CGM showed glucose never above 8 mmol/L.  

When I asked what type of diabetes I have, my doctor said “since you respond to meds, you’re type 2.”  

Weight changes:  
- At diagnosis: 69 kg (height 5’6.5”)  
- After 1.5 months: 65 kg (unintentional loss)  
- Now (3 months later): 63 kg  

My dietitian reviewed my CGM data and calorie logs, noticed I was having lows, and advised me to stick with 1 tab daily instead of 2. She also suggested I ask my doctor to reconsider the diagnosis, since my lean body type, weight loss, and age might point toward LADA (type 1.5).  

Latest results:  
- HbA1c: 6.0 (after 3 months)  
- Blood work: all normal, triglycerides improved  
- Ultrasound: showed signs of fatty liver (doctor told me to “avoid all fats,” even though I mostly eat balanced and only added nuts/avocados recently).  

Concerns:  
- My doctor insists I’m type 2 and says “when you’re older and meds stop working, you’ll become type 1.”  
- He wrote “extremely high BP” on my ultrasound referral, but my BP has always been normal (I even showed logs to the technician).  
- He prescribed the ultrasound mainly because I kept asking him about the type of diabetes and my unexplained weight loss.  
- I know there’s a 90% chance I’m type 2 since both my parents are, but I don’t want to risk even a 10% chance of a wrong diagnosis.  
- I feel like my progress (A1c drop, lifestyle changes) is mostly self-driven, and my doctor isn’t considering current research or nuances like LADA.  

Question:  
Is it just me, or does this sound like my doctor isn’t very knowledgeable about diabetes management? Should I look for a new family doctor who’s more up-to-date on diabetes care?

A 2-year-old girl in the UK recently died from undiagnosed Type 1 diabetes after her symptoms were mistaken for a minor illness. She had classic signs that many parents (and even some doctors) don’t recognise in toddlers:

The 4Ts:
• Toilet – more wet nappies / going more often
• Thirst – drinking much more than usual
• Tired – unusual sleepiness or low energy
• Thinner – sudden weight loss

In very young children, Type 1 can be mistaken for things like viral infections, teething or tonsillitis. Awareness of the 4Ts can make a huge difference.

1pi84pn,Major breakthrough against diabetes thanks to a microbial molecule that disarms inflammation,"Just thought I'd share some encouraging research news (the full article is here : HTTPS://WWW.NATURE.COM/ARTICLES/S42255-025-01413-8) 


An international research team led by Professor Marc-Emmanuel Dumas at Imperial College 
London & CNRS together with Prof. Patrice Cani (Imperial & University of Louvain, UCLouvain), Dr. Dominique Gauguier (Imperial & INSERM, Paris) and Prof. Peter Liu (University of Ottawa Heart 
Institute) has uncovered a surprising ally in the fight against insulin resistance and type 2 
diabetes: a microbial metabolite called trimethylamine (TMA). Published in Nature Metabolism, the study reveals that TMA, produced by gut bacteria from dietary choline can block a key immune pathway and improve blood sugar control.
This major breakthrough has its roots 20 years earlier. During his postdoctoral research, Patrice 
Cani discovered that a high-fat diet leads to the presence of bacterial components in the body, which activates the immune system and triggers inflammation, eventually causing insulin resistance in diabetic individuals. Considered far-fetched in 2005, this finding is now well established and widely accepted by scientists.
In 2025, researchers from University of Louvain and Imperial College London finally uncovered how to counter this process. They observed that TMA, produced by gut bacteria from a natural nutrient, dietary choline, found in certain foods can improve blood-sugar control. 
How? By acting as a natural inhibitor of the protein IRAK4, a key component of the immune system. 
Normally, when exposed to a high-fat diet, IRAK4 sounds the alarm and triggers inflammation to  signal dietary imbalance. 
The problem? With constant overload (as seen in type 2 diabetes), IRAK4 overreacts, causing cascading inflammation that drives insulin resistance.
By combining human cell models, mouse studies, andmolecular-target screening, scientists discovered that TMA can bind directly to IRAK4 and block its activity. The direct effect is a reduction in fat-induced inflammation and a restoration of insulin sensitivity. In essence, it 
reprograms the negative metabolic responses caused by poor diet. Even more striking: the molecule can prevent sepsis-induced mortality in mice by blocking widespread inflammation.
“This shows how nutrition and our gut microbes can work together by producing molecules that 
M fight inflammation and improve metabolic health!”, said Prof. Patrice Cani, co-senior author, 
University of Louvain, Belgium and visiting professor at Imperial College London.

The team also observed that genetically deleting IRAK4 or blocking it pharmacologically 
reproduced the beneficial effects of the bacterial metabolite. This opens new therapeutic avenues
for diabetes, using a target, IRAK4, that is already validated within the pharmaceutical industry.
“This flips the narrative,” said Prof. Dumas. “We’ve shown that a molecule from our gut microbes
can actually protect against the harmful effects of a poor diet through a new mechanism. It’s a 
new way of thinking about how the microbiome influences our health.” 
“This shows how nutrition and our gut microbes can work together by producing molecules that  fight inflammation and improve metabolic health!”, said Prof. Patrice Cani, co-senior author,

Although I felt extatic because I'd never lost so much weight my parents knew something was wrong with me. I was waking up 3 to 4 times a night have to pee. The pee was sticky but then they put their foot down and took me to the doctor after I was let go from my job. I was diagnosed with type 2 since then and I have always mismanaged my diabetes. Well not anymore


Recently my wife and I went to a concert around 2 hours away. We had a great time. Everything was pretty much normal. As we are trying to finally go to sleep after this great night, as I'm about to fall asleep I jolted out of my sleep and just started shivering/shaking. This never happened to me before so Immediately said I have to go to the hospital. Thankfully there was a hospital just 5 minutes from our hotel we went to. My blood sugar was at 586 when we arrived and this was my wake up call. The doctors prescribed me metformin and Lantus initially 15 units  but have slowly increased to around 40 unit. 10 in the morning, 30 at night.

I hope everyone who deals with this doesn't need any of these as a Wake up call. It is honestly a terrifying experience to have that happen. Currently with my meds I am hovering around 110 to 180 and when we go out and eat a lot of carbs it will shoot up into the 200s never 300 thankfully. If there is any advice people can give me to help out on this journey as the typical stay away from rice and if you do eat carbs, make sure you have fiber, how do you all go about these problems. I have had anxiety built up because although yes I have better control I almost feel like I don't do enough.

I am terribly worried.","Hello, Im a worried and looking for help. My partner is not asking for help, but I am connected to her Dexcom and the readings are sporadic and dangerous. She tells me that if she could, she would only eat candy. Her eating patterns reflect that perfectly. Just yesterday, she ate one sweet milk tea flavored bread for lunch, then later in the day, EIGHT bags of soft candy. Altogether, the candy ran more than 1000 calories.  Her blood sugar readings spiked above 400 twice. Afterwards, she didnt have the appetite for dinner. I see patterns like this more often than not, and I dont know how else to drill into her mind that this is terribly unhealthy, and that it is risking her health.

She has vented to me that the frustration at work made her eat the candy mindlessly. Eight bags is a new scary record of bags that she has told me that she has consumed. Usually, she will eat four bags of candies a day.  There have been days where she eats entirely too many sweets, and days where she barely eats enough to escape her hypos.

We both have mental illnesses, such as ADHD and autism. I want to help her, and I have told her how worried I am about her health. She had a rough childhood where different people put her on strict and limiting diets to an abusive level, and I think that might have distorted her image of food. She also experiences trouble with dosing her insulin correctly, and gets frustrated. One of the darker thoughts she has vented to me in her vulnerable moments was that when she was younger, she would ""abuse"" her body by eating incorrectly, because her family told her that she would die young from diabetes - so she figured ""what's the use?""

Can you have MODY2 that is generally asymptomatic but yave something push you over? I know pregnancy does but what about steroids,big hormonal fluctuations or psych meds renound for metabolic changes?

Did the test take months to come back? Will they wait until they have gone through all 13 genes before reporting if one lights up? 

I am really curious to find out because metformin had no response, didn't try SU oral because high sugars when untreated but hypos possible when treated on low dose GLP1.

The idea that possibly all i need is very low dose sulfanurea would be reassuring but im probably getting ahead of myself.

Its just my diabetes has been atypical and not followed the usual course of disease.

Not just looking at MODY2 but also all MODY. Was just curious if you can be MODY but for a period look a lot like other diabetes due to medical treatment compounding.

Also if its Mono genic, what if two of the many genes they test have a fault? Is it then multi genic?

Did anyone show MODY signs earlier but because it didn't look like typical diabetes their doctor waited until symptoms got more pronounced to call it diabetes?

1phu1kx,LADA or something else,"Does anyone have experience with LADA?  Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults. My dad is 50, and probably 120 pounds soaking wet. Recently went for routine bloodwork, his sugar was in the 600s. Gp referred to an endo. They diagnosed him with type 2 diabetes. When he asked if they were sure that it was type 2, she said 100% and that it would be impossible for him to have type one since you’d have to be born with it and that was that. So he went on his merry way you know trusting your doctor! Got prescribed a ton of new meds, insulin shots etc. Shortly after he had a stroke, thank god it was a small one. It’s been a couple months and he just feels absolutely terrible, can’t go to work. Alternates between the bed and the couch all day. Has high highs and LOW lows. Seems just about every night his sugar is dropping to the 50s or lower. Says he feels like he is literally dying everyday. He’s gone back to his endo and gp both of which say oh sorry all I can say is to keep taking your meds! So I’ve been doing my own research. And I KNOW google is not a doctor. But with my  experience with doctors lately, the internet seems to do more good than harm these days. That’s when I discovered LADA. Which I’m almost certain is what he actually has. And that the meds being used to treat his “type 2 diabetes” are actually killing him since he doesn’t even have that. Just looking for advice or anything pertaining to LADA or if anyone else has any thoughts. I found him a new endo and he’s got an expedited referral from his gp so hopefully we will have more answers soon. ",1765242134.0,4,11,diabetes,diabetes

Clearly I’ve added meds and insulin. But how do I get it down more. What do you eat that you enjoy? How do you eat with your family and not make two meals? Do you pretend like Thanksgiving and Christmas? You’re not diabetic? 

Do you occasionally have a full sugar soda, knowing your sugars will spike.

I am not surprised that I’m diabetic. I thought I was ahead of it when I was prediabetic. I weighed 275 pounds when being diagnosed as a diabetic I’m at 170lbs.

In researching this I’m seeing both “don’t do it it’s dangerous” and “this helped immensely with my insulin resistance and weightloss” so I really don’t know what to conclude. Years ago I brought up IF to my endo and she helped me change my basal rates to fit the lifestyle, but ofc I can’t ask her again until my next appointment.

1phqgbx,"Long term partner with T1DM and doesn’t take care of himself, idk what to do.","Hello, this is my first ever Reddit post and I don’t even know why I’m making this post. Community, input, advice? I’m a 22 y/o F and have been with my boyfriend 25 y/o M since 2019. He was diagnosed with T1DM when he was 15 and when our relationship first started it was never a problem. Throughout the years, instead of him gaining more understanding and control about his disease, it has been quite the opposite. I have been as understanding and sensitive as I feel I can, especially because I work in healthcare and soon will be a pharmacist, so my position requires me to completely understand diabetes and the psychosocial effects it can have as well as treatment and devices. I have always babied him (so has his mom) so the first few times he went DKA, I was more than sensitive, attentive and understanding that we are a partnership and will get through these barriers together.  He has now gone DKA probably about 8 times since we have been together in the last 6 years and nearly died a couple of the times. Well, his diabetes isn’t the only health issue he has…. He has always been a big weed smoker since we have been together. Well, after so many times of going DKA, and mixed with the excessive smoking (he usually smokes about 5 woods after work, more than a 3.5/day), he developed gastroparesis. He started to have gastroparesis flare ups that would land him in the hospital and cause him to be unable to eat. After so many episodes of gastroparesis, he now has to get pyloric spinchter dilations every 3-6 months because he will just stop eating. None of this has gotten him to stop smoking or pursue getting a pump and cgm to monitor himself better. His glucometer broke MONTHS AGO and he has been bolusing himself blindly with no idea as to what his glucose is. Multiple ENDO and GI docs have told him the same story over and over again. If you don’t get this under control, you will die. If you don’t get a GPOEM procedure for your gastroparesis and take your medicine on a regular basis, you will continue to have the same issues. He is on daily meds that he maybe takes weekly. I’ve gotten him a pill box, counseled him on adherence, made all his appointments for him, we aren’t even married and I’m on his HIPAA because I’m the only one that takes the initiative to ensure he’s scheduled for all of his appointments, doesn’t run out of insulin or GI meds, etc. because he has let himself run out of insulin many times. I have voiced to him all I want to see out of him is initiative. Just to see that he wants to ensure his health is under control. What doesn’t make any of this better is that he is a truck driver for a living. He is the pickiest eater you will ever meet in your life so getting him on a meal plan is impossible. He’s severely underweight. I’ve meal prepped for him the few things he says he will eat and he doesn’t. I thought we were getting to the next stage of our lives now that I am almost done with school and he has his career, but if he can’t take care of himself or care enough to learn about his disease and manage them, how can I expect if one of our future kids have T1DM, he will care a lick about them either? I’m just struggling. Am I being too hard on him? Am I babying him too much? It feels like it hurts me more than him that he isn’t healthy bc all I want for him is to be healthy, but I can’t force him to do the things he knows he needs to do to get there. And I know that in order for things to ever grow, he needs to love himself enough to take care of him self and his health. I’m so tired and drained. It’s been one too many years of the same conversations. Why would someone not want to get better? Anything helps, I’m willing to take any feedback, good or bad, any advice from someone in a similar situation (even if it’s ur kid bc sometimes I feel like he is mine) and sorry for the long post.

I had a third surgery this year.  Each surgery, throws my glucose off - much harder to control when eating schedules, NPO, IVs, diet, is all controlled by medical staff.  Not terribly out of control, mind you, but when I pride myself keeping my food spikes routinely between 140-150, with occasional spikes to 180 but not above, I was suddenly having regular food spikes up to 230.  Then back under control within a few days - even given insulin in the hospital for the first surgery when I never needed it before.

However, released from the hospital, and much better control of glucose.  Abdominal surgery causes sharp pains just getting up and down - using those muscles that are all stitched together.

Update 2:  It is the FreeStyle Lite strips that I have.  I have tested them to find that they are still good.

—————————

Type 2 diabetic here.  I have been using a FreeStyle Lite glucose meter.  The last week my glucose readings have been 48 for several mornings, straight in a row.  My body used to tell me that my blood sugar was too low by getting shakey, having a hard time focusing my mind, and getting extremely hot.  When at least 2 of those things happened at the same time, I knew it was time to try to get to the kitchen (would then have a hard time walking) and try to find something sweet to eat until I could feel my body react to the sugar (getting steady on my feet and being cooling back down.)

This past week, I had no symptoms, so I started questioning the reading of 48, especially since it was a steady 48 for several mornings.  I bought a new meter yesterday, thinking my glucose meter had a problem.  This morning the NEW meter read 53.

It seems highly unlikely that a brand new meter in a sealed box can ALSO be wrong.

I don't take insulin.  I just take a few pills, and in all honesty, I had drastically cut back from the medication I had been taking because I have drastically cut back on carbs and food that should have been cut from my diet long ago.

Thoughts on my low readings, please.  Is 48 to 53ish too low? I guess I can cut even further back on my medication.  Where should my morning (before breakfast) reading be?  I know that a person without diabetes should have a reading under 100.  Other than that, I feel like I'm clueless.

I have sent a message to my PCP, but have not heard back from him over the weekend.  I thought I would ask people who are actually diabetic what your readings are, or what your thoughts are.

The holidays are closing in, so I wanted to share my favorite keto dessert recipe that can be incorporated into all low carb diets and is really tasty: 

250ml/1 Cup full cream

(35%-37% fat content, I use dairy, but plant based works too) 

50g/2oz 99% dark chocolate 

(I use Lindt, aim for any product that staits 9g net carbs per 100g/4oz with <0.5g sugar) 

3-5TBSP Allulose 

(I use Health Garden) 

1 tsp Instant coffee powder (optional) 

- Chop chocolate finely and place into a metal bowl 

- Add Allulose and coffee powder to 1/2 Cup full cream and heat on the stove on low-medium heat until bubbles start forming on the rim of the pot 

- Pour the hot mixture over the chopped chocolate and wait about 2min until the chocolate has completely melted 

- Whisk until smooth and let cool down completely 

- Add 1/2 cup full cream from the fridge and whip up with an electric whisk/mixer . It doesn’t take very long ~1-2min to get to a smooth, fluffy texture. Don’t overwork it, so it won’t split 

- Chill in the fridge for at least 3h (preferably overnight) 

- Enjoy. 😊

Last week I had my labs done to see where I’m at, and holy cow I was not expecting how much of an improvement I was going to see! My a1c is now at a 5.6 (out of even a prediabetic range), glucose from 108 to 85, and my cholesterol that was originally at 190 was now down to 85, with everything else back in the green as well (except my HDL was slightly lower, but my Dr. says it’s because of the total cholesterol having dropped so much). 

Physically wise I feel so much better; my joints don’t hurt like they have for years, the swelling in my legs have decreased majorly (my compression socks keep sliding down as a result), and any swelling that does happen isn’t as intense or goes away a lot faster.

Overall I’ve been able to walk so much more, especially since I haven’t been in as much pain, and plan to start going to the gym again because I miss lifting weights like I used to and want to build my strength back up again. 

Honestly as much as a frustration as it can be at times, I’m actually glad I got my diagnosis. It made me finally get my act together and start realizing how much I was hurting my body just for a few minutes of pleasure from a slice of cake or candy bar…only it would be a few times a day having it. I love Mexican food (I’m Californian so we live for it) so instead of 6 tacos I now only will have 3, and ask for one tortilla for each taco instead of the usual 2 and pair it with some charro beans for additional fiber, or just get fajitas with extra veggies and no tortillas, rice, or sour cream. Being diagnosed changed me in a positive way, and at the rate I’m going I wonder where I’m going to be when I get my next checkup in 6 months😊

I know prednisone can spike blood sugar and was keeping a close eye on things, was largely able to stay under 300 and would come back down to 100 or so with my other med regimen. 

Anyone else have issues with significant increase in joint pain on prednisone? It’s also recently gotten cold here which might be contributing.

On one of them I even skipped it because I was too tired. When I told my Endo, she got on my ass about that because she said that one of these days if I skip a low alert I could end up not waking up ever again.

I’m trying to understand what’s going on with my dad’s health and I’m getting mixed signals from the lab results. Any insight would really help.

My Dad:
• 58-year-old male
• Type-2 diabetic
• High Blood Pressure
• On medications (Getryl, Glucophage, BP meds, statin, etc.)

What’s confusing me:

1. Random Blood Sugar (RBS) was 115 mg/dL just 1 week ago

• This seemed perfect
• Taken after a normal meal
• He wasn’t having any symptoms
→ Looked like diabetes was under control

2. But today his Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) came out 213 mg/dL

• He fasted for 13 hours
• No food, only water
→ I don’t understand why fasting sugar is so high when RBS was perfectly normal one week ago.

3. HbA1c trend is also confusing

• HbA1c on 5 October: 7.1%
• HbA1c on 5 December (2 months later): 7.4%
→ Even though his RBS readings seemed good some days, overall HbA1c has increased.

4. Kidney function improved instead of worsening?

• Creatinine on 5 October: 1.30 mg/dL
• Creatinine on 5 December: 0.99 mg/dL
→ eGFR improved a lot
→ How did kidneys improve while sugar got worse?",1765037999.0,0,6,diabetes,diabetes

1pezzpb,GLP-1 insurance coverage in CANADA for non type 2.,"Hi all, are there any diabetics in Canada here who are not type 2 but have gotten approval for coverage on a GLP-1 (eg. Ozempic) through Canada Life / other insurance? I am a diabetic but the type is unclear (long story below but my doctor will not diagnose me with either type), and ozempic is the only diabetic drug that controls my blood sugars. Canada Life has denied my request based on the fact that my diagnosis is not listed as type 2. 

A bit of a long back story, I am a diabetic who is currently taking ozempic, but I am neither a type 1 or type 2. I was initially diagnosed as type 1 in my teenage years and was put on insulin. Then a couple years in, my diagnosis changed to type 2 and I was put on metformin. That worked for a little bit but I was eventually put back on insulin and rediagnosed as a type 1. However, neither insulin nor metformin was ever super effective in controlling my A1c (it was always super high). 2 years ago, I started taking ozempic out of pocket and it quite quickly eliminated my need to insulin completely (confirming that i am not a type 1). I have been off insulin for 2 years now, and my A1cs are flawless.  My doctor doesn’t think I have type 2 because I was diagnosed so young, and instead thinks I have a type of genetic diabetes (i even did genetic testing but it came back inconclusive). As a result, I have no clear diagnosis on what “type” of diabetes I have, but I am indeed diabetic.

Of course, all of this medical history/ past records were outlined in detail in my initial request + appeal letter from my doctor. However, Canada Life denied the appeal based on the fact that my “condition” is not indicated to be treated by Ozempic from Health Canada. 

Is there anything my doctor can say/ provide in a second appeal to change this decision? I have tried all the treatments for both types of diabetes, but only the Ozempic has worked to control my diabetes. I do not fit the criteria to have a GLP covered under weight loss. 

Any and all advice/insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Glucose over the past 4 years has gone up and down between 98-135but no real trend line. The A1 has drifted the same between 5.5 and 6.4

Not overly thirsty or peeing a lot. Perhaps minor cuts/scratches take longer to heal, but no other physical symptoms.

My PCP diagnosed me as Type 2 the second time my Sugar exceeded 130 for two out of three years, but in between it was 110.

>My issue is that I don't really know how concerned I should be, or how radical I should change my lifestyle, if at all. With annual physicals only allowing 15 minutes with a PCP, I've never gotten my physician to drill down on my questions other than telling me 'don't get fat'

1pesyns,I call your wisdom and advice : How to BOLUS for big meals.,"Hello, fellow diabetics or parents of diabetic children. 

We are new to this (4 weeks) and as you once have been are learning of a new world full of wonders, technology and frustration. We currently have 91%TIR and 5.9/107 median, with 5.6/101 waking average. We are (my kid) T1D, 14 years old and using a Tandem X2 pump. 

What we have not managed to figure out yet is how to properly BOLUS for a larger meal (dinner). I have read so many texts and comments, but I would like a personal experience from someone that has real practical experience and not a medical interpretation. Currently, we are mostly overshooting (up to 10-11/180-200 and then comes the low 3.5-4/63-72 after dinner for the past 3-4 days. Carb calculations are usually correct but we are GI unaware.

  
1. If you eat quick carbs, BOLUS first, wait 15 minutes and then eat. This is pretty straight forward, and it works (for the most part) as long as we calculate the carbs right. 

2. Should ALL carbs be calculated, or just sugar carbs? What is the point with the sugar carbs?

3. Should we be looking at the Glycemic Index of things? How do we interpret that? 

4. If you eat slow carbs, should you wait with the BOLUS? How long? We ate lentils the other day that contain LOTS of carbs but they are EXTREMELY slow and i did not know how slow until we had a super low incident 1 hour later. It seems that BASAL can probably handle lentils by itself... 

5. What do you do if you are too low 3.9/70 or very high 10/180, and you want to eat? If low, eat and don't BOLUS? If high, preBOLUS wait until it goes lower and then eat?

6. Some meals are extremely complex and hard to calculate the GI and total carbs, what is a good rule of thumb to use when BOLUSing? How much far off is it ok to miss a calculation? Would a pump compensate some for the BASAL it's giving, or would that come in addition?

1pefzw9,Feeling angry at PCP,"I was recently referred to a weight management (WM) program due to a severe sleep apnea diagnosis. Apparently insurance (in USA) is more likely to cover WM programs/providers if you have severe sleep apnea. Part of the WM program intake is running labs, and turns out I probably have full blown diabetes. I found out 2 days ago and have been fairly upset, depressed, even mad. My results:

A1C = 8.3%
Insulin = 50.1 uIU

My PCP ran labs almost exactly a year ago and ran a ""glucose, random"" test that returned normal and stated I had a low risk of diabetes. I am going through the stages of grief currently, but feeling very angry that I went from ""low diabetes risk"" to ""full blown diabetes"" in a year? I know generally the internet is the enemy, but everything points to I should have had more than a year between non-diabetic and diabetic lab results, especially since I show at least some of the risk factors (obesity, sedentary job, etc).

I haven't had my follow-up yet, but need to go back to my PCP to confirm and start treatment. I have had several other negative experiences from this same provider (took 9 months to resolve a persistent non-COVID wet cough, rushed through another appointment about an infected ruptured cyst with no care instructions -- both of which I subsequently had to visit an urgent care for). Would it be a set back to try to find a new PCP right now? Should I just visit my current PCP to start treatment and then find a new one? I just don't think I can trust them. Even if they didn't do anything technically wrong I think I will probably blame and/or distrust them going forward. They also didn't give me any pain relief when changing an IUD which was excruciating.

I would also love to hear if this has happened to other people. I thought I had more time to course correct, especially because my PCP never mentioned that I needed to make immediate changes.

1pdwmqc,T2D Questions - Does anyone else experience this?,"Newly diagnosed T2, and I'm on Metformin ER and Ozempic (about to switch to Mounjaro when my insurance finally accepts the PA).

I feel like every medication gives me GI issues, especially at night. 
When I was a prediabetic (when I got diagnosed with PCOS and swapped to a new doctor), my doctor put me on Metformin and it gave me horrible GI issues. Day and Night. 
So we stopped it and my A1C was under control so we said that we'd just keep checking it. 
Well I had one hell of a year for 2025 (lots of stress, lots of death in the family from cancer. I wasn't in a good place mentally for a while) and I ended up being diagnosed as T2 about a month ago.

Because of my prior issues with Metformin, my doctor got me on Metformin ER. Now, the extended release has done wonders for me during the day. I usually don't have issues with my stomach. It's when I take it at night that I get horrible cramps and diarrhea that usually have me awake for about an hour during the night. 
Does anyone have any idea why it does this?
Does anyone else experience this?

Now, my doctor started me on Ozempic. We did this because its what he has as samples in his office. I didn't have a hard time with that symptom wise (thought I would because I tend to have a ton of symptoms for most medications, especially in the beginning). The only thing I found was that if I was on the 0.5mg dose - my leg hurt after injection. Was that the same for anyone else? It only hurt for a little bit, maybe felt like my leg was twitchy for a bit and then it went away by bed time (took my dose in the afternoon/evening). 


Finally, only because I'm curious to see how others have reacted. 
I've been tracking my glucose like crazy. Probably more than most people do (I'm talking after my morning meds, right before I eat, 2hr after I eat, and then before and after my evening medications). Now I know that the supplies aren't cheap. I was mainly doing this in the beginning to see when I spiked or didn't and my levels have only been as high as 189, never higher and as low as 91. 
Is this normal? I feel like I don't know what I should be expecting and some of my reads are without medication because I either didnt get any of it before work and some days I don't really go out of range. Like my fasting glucose is high. I tend to have a high morning before my medications (110-125) but then it will mellow out to the 90s before breakfast at work (after my meds/without my meds). 
I've never spiked higher than 189 and I'm just curious why my A1C would indicate that I've had an average blood glucose of 200+ when my average isn't even near that without my medication (currently no medication for about a week or so because my insurance won't do my PA for Mounjaro and I am going through life just managing with Metformin ER).",1764844069.0,4,9,diabetes,diabetes

1pdim9i,Celebration with people who understand,"In August, 2 days before my birthday, I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I believe my hba1c was 9.3 and my blood sugar was 498 at the doctor’s office. I had been getting super sick all year with different things, which I now believe were at least tangentially related to my diabetes (and I had IV steroids shortly before my diagnosis which I know can elevate blood sugar even more). I’ve always had a sweet tooth, and to say I was devastated would be an understatement. But I started reading about how other people managed their diabetes on this and other subs, and I did have some knowledge of it as one of my best friends was type 1 when we were kids. So I started making dietary and lifestyle changes immediately. 

My dr prescribed Metformin for me, but I was doing a bit of traveling around the time of my diagnosis and didn’t want to potentially have an upset stomach, so we decided I would wait to start it. I got a glucose meter and tested on my fingers at least 7 times per day, and kept a log to show my doctor. At my one month appointment she was so impressed with my numbers, she asked me to hold off on starting any meds so we could see what my hba1c looked like at my 3 month without meds. 

I cut out added sugar; initially I was under 100 g of carbs per day but have upped those a bit as I have diverticulitis and need to eat a high fiber diet, but luckily I’ve found net carbs don’t seem to spike me. So a good number of my carbs come from fiber. I went from eating very few veggies to eating a ton, I try to fill about half of my plate as per the plate method.

1pcvrj7,Mom's sugar high for months despite years of meds... Please advise!,"My mum's 72 and got diagnosed back in 2017 along with high blood pressure. It was an extremely stressful time of our lives, as my dad was in advance stages of a particularly acute dementia diagnosis, and life since he passed in 2018 hasn't exactly been a walk in the park either- I mention this, as I know stress is a big contributor to sugar spiking as well I believe.

Anyways, she's been on meds since then, currently Metformin HD, Gliclazide, and Ozempic, and for a while the sugar seemed to be decently under control (though not ideal), around 7-8, but has seemingly steadily continued to climb despite no significant changes in her diet, and for a couple months now has been around 13-15 every morning, going up to 20 at one point (but quickly dropped). She's always had a sweet tooth and will still partake albeit VERY sparingly, like i.e. one or two slices (about 2"" each) of a strudel or a couple of low-sugar little yoghurt cups, an apple, etc., and even for savoury foods, eats very little, partly due to her dental situation (dentures which can't seem to sit) but also due to wanting to keep the sugar down... and nowadays, the lowest we've ever seen it is 9-10, which is still far from ideal.

One factor which I can potentially think of contributing to the spike is that up until last year, she used to go for brisk daily walks of 20-30 minutes, but since we moved and don't really have a suitable place nearby that's to her liking, she's greatly reduced the walking beyond what's part of our daily lives (we live together).

She's always been slightly heavier-set, but very active, independent, and generally quite health-conscious (again, even those few sweets she has, it's in strict moderation).

She's very conscious of the numbers, intently tracks, but also doesn't seem to be too much in a rush to do something about the steadily rising number...

I'm very concerned for her as I'm aware of what the effects of prolonged high sugar like this can be, and certainly don't want her to incur any of them.

I'm assuming the only solution will be to up her dosages, though I know she's been afraid of that, partly due to the awful side-effects she experienced for several years (constant diarrhea, among others... mentioning to doctor didn't change anything)... and also maybe afraid of getting started on insulin. I will mention, as a result of the Ozempic, she's lost probably around 50lbs- her appetite is markedly decreased from what it was, though it was never particularly significant. 

Does anything in what I've divulged here stand out as the potential impetus behind why her numbers have steadily continued to rise? Is this to be expected over time, especially if doses have stayed same for a long time?

Any feedback/advice would be very much appreciated- it's just mum and I against the world, and she's my absolute everything, so I want to ensure she'll be around and in good health for as long as possible of course.",1764739486.0,2,6,diabetes,diabetes
1pcqzfu,Problems with weight.,"To begin with, I don't speak English (I'm Brazilian), so the post may be a little confusing. Anyway, I'm a woman (19 years old) and I've had diabetes for 7 years and I've never been able to maintain a stable weight. I've been overweight since childhood and only got worse after the diagnosis, my doctor always complained about my weight and highlighted that IT WAS A PROBLEM, and now that I use contraception it's only gotten worse. The only time I was at the ""ideal"" weight was when I discovered diabetes and almost died, I went from 62kg to 50kg in a week, and I was around 50kg until I was 1 year after diagnosis, and everything went wrong during the pandemic, since then I've always fluctuated between 70 and 80kg, no more and no less.
 I did yoga for a while, I know it's not something that has a big impact, but I have an undiagnosed problem with my hip, as well as being a kind of therapy and being associated with a diet, but it only worked to make me more leggy (I'm naturally lame, being overweight only highlights this). Furthermore, I tried and managed to ""induce"" ketoacidosis a few times to lose weight quickly, it worked but it wasn't worth it, I was left with a pale complexion, insatiable hunger and mortal thirst, in addition to absurdly high blood sugar levels. I did this stupid thing for events where I wanted to look beautiful, but I risked my life to do so.

Went on metformin and started watching my carbs (not 0 carb, just less) and A1C increased from 7 to 8 in a year. Then I got pregnant, was treated as a gestational diabetic, added insulin and A1C went back down to 7 when I gave birth. Since then my doctor now assumes type 1 but have been tested for Type 1, LADA and MODY and then had a type 1 panel which I think looks for other links to type 1. Everything came back negative. My doctor still thinks some form of autoimmune related type 1. 

Currently on long and short acting insulin with an A1C of 6.7 which my doctor is happy with but I'd like to still lower. 
My concern is that if I'm testing negative for type 1, am I actually type 2 and adding all this insulin is just overloading my body with insulin and causing worse insulin resistance? She says that's not how it works and not to worry about that but I'm not so sure. Also my dietician always says not to deprive myself, eat what I want and take enough insulin but that doesn't feel right either. 

I also have a sensitive stomach and lots of food sensitivities which makes no carb a little difficult. Eg. Eating only bacon and eggs for breakfast makes me feel terrible. Eggs on an empty stomach is bad news.

1pb29kt,CGM taught me how food order affects my blood sugar — but stable glucose doesn’t always mean weight loss 😅,"This weekend I discovered something interesting from my CGM:  
as long as I start with vegetables (either a raw salad or some stir-fried greens), then have some protein, and eat high-carb foods like rice or dumplings at the end, my blood sugar curve stays super stable.

For example, as shown in the chart, yesterday I first had stir-fried bamboo shoots with mushrooms, then stir-fried pork kidney, and finally dumplings — and my blood sugar didn’t spike at all!

But stable glucose doesn’t necessarily mean not gaining weight...  
My lowest weight this weekend was 60.1 kg, but after two rowing sessions (about 25 km total) plus one strength workout, I ate quite a lot to recover. Even though my glucose stayed flat, the extra food and water retention pushed my weight up to 61.5 kg the next morning.

CGM has been really helpful for me —

1. It helps me understand my own eating habits.
2. I’m also learning how to guide my prediabetic father with his meals, since he doesn’t wear a CGM.

The lancer won't take the lancets used by every. single. lancer. that I've used for 30+ years. 

It needs waaaay more blood than most meters I've used for ages (easily 5x what a freestyle meter needs).

If you don't get enough blood immediately, but happen to get just enough to trigger the countdown, it will fail, and the strip is toast.  This happens even when there's plenty of actual blood there, but something gets botched with the capillary action and it just stops pulling blood up.  I've tossed almost half my strips because of this.  Like 50% of the time I have to lance twice, and use two strips to get one reading.

The display is upside down.  When you do finally get blood on the damned thing, you need to turn the device over to read it.  I think they made it thinking of how someone would check a patient's bg, not how a diabetic would test themselves.

Anyway, if you have the choice of meters/strips, pick anything else.

1pavomc,What behavior and support do you want from your partner regarding your treatment?,"Hello! My partner is type 1 diabetic, diagnosed when he was 3 months old. 
Before I met him, I was totally ignorant about this condition and I didn't know anything about it. He explained to me everything necessary and how to act in an emergency. In addition, over time we began to have our routine and I am totally adapted to his timing, such as waiting for his insulin to be given before eating or making all our meals completely suitable and healthy. 

I understand that each person is different, I recently read about someone who did not want their partner to know anything about their illness, leaving them completely out of the situation. 

I'm curious, how do you handle the relationship between your partner and your condition? do they have rules? Do you have any preferences regarding the support you want to receive from your partner?

So here we are good people of reddit. Hands bloodied with no certainty that what we are trying is even correct. Two vets asking for your take on whatever you may want to share. I say that specifically because our request is likely very overwhelming. For that, we apologize and thank you for your patience.

Our research has led us to many differing products and procedures depending on the type of diabetes(which we don't know yet). I will share that my wife has MS which very likely contributed to her new diagnosis because she eats as healthy as you could ask anyone to do. 

So friends, do you have recommendations for glucose tracking devices....best times to test...your favorite Diabetes friendly snacks/foods/drinks. Advice in general. Anything that requires no blood? ( I read that this is like asking for a way to make gold out of lead)

I guess I just want people to reassure me that she is going to have a long, healthy, and active life even with this new stumbling block.  

She has lost 20 pounds in the last few weeks as she tried to wait it out and see if she would feel better without going to the dr.  We suspected diabetes for 2 weeks.  The thirst, blurred vision…. Lots of little things.  Now she is clinically underweight and how is she going to out it back on while still watching her carbs?   Are there any athletes here?  She runs, lifts weights, rock climbs, walks everywhere…. Has always been thin but now really needs to gain some weight.  Any tips on how to do this without throwing her blood sugar completely out of whack? 

Dr currently has her titrating up a long acting insulin but she is still running in the 200s and 300s but it’s only been 5 days since diagnoses.  The dr suggested that she may only need the long acting insulin but everything I read suggests that eventually she will need the fast acting before meals?  We are still waiting for the CGM to be approved by insurance and for now just doing insulin injections but I know she would like some sort of pump or the Omni pod or something similar but I don’t think it’s going to be approved by insurance so we will wait and see.

1p9sllv,The journey of me...,"please note, this is informative and based solely on my own experiences, nothing else nothing more.

  
So about 10 years ago(33) I started noticing that i was extremely tired all the time, hands were constantly tingly and numb, feet and toes were tingly and extremely sensitive(if i walked barefoot which i use to do alot i could feel everything it was hard to walk sometimes. obviously I kept complaining to my dr, who in turn always said i was fine(even when initial sugar tests would be around 150+) and would never run a1c tests.

  
Lived like this for a few years just getting worse, I couldn't concentrate, hell at this time i was a database and script developer for the fusion delphi fork for a ragnarok online private server software, and freelanced scripts for eAthena, which i could do with my eyes closed, until i couldn't, couldn't concentrate, couldn't remember what i was doing, couldn't even remember simple functions and syntax, to the point where i was unable to pay the bills doing so anymore, so i got a real job which required DOT, upon initial certification nothing was a problem(but they only drug tested me, no protein or sugar test as is required(and that facility was shut down at some point..))

  
everything just got worse, dr still said i was fine, then 2 things happened.. The ""Little friend"" stopped doing his job(pging it here) which happened to be just before my next DOT at a different facility, who only gave me a temp 3 month card as they actually did test the sugar in the pee which was Sugar+++ on the result, and highly encouraged me to see my dr, who even after see that said i was still fine their test was wrong(mind you this has been several years and still no A1C) and that the friend not working was in my head.

  
at that point(i have anger issues :D) i gave his ... a piece of my mind which was no where near disney pg rated at all. and he had me escorted out.

  
a week later i was at a new drs office(and still my current dr) when i went through everything i had noticed all the history and the DOT screening results he immediately did an A1C.... 15.8%

  
he immediately put me on the following..

invokana, arcabos, metformin, actos, there were 2 more but I can not remember the names.

trulicity came in at some point but i wasn't enjoying that at all.

  
he then required me to see him monthly with monthly a1c checks. on the 4th month my a1c was down to 9. of course i felt like absolute shit the entire time, worse then ever, he said it was to be expected as we were dropping my sugars and A1C extremely fast and i was use to extremely high sugars all day every day.

out came mounjaro, with my complaints about the trulicity he switched me to it, first dose kicked my ass(used abdomin) second and subsequent doses i used my thigh and very little side effects if any.

  
within 6 months A1c was down to 7 and we came off everything but the metformin and mounjaro. and appointments after ever 6 months.

  
then came the mounjaro shortage because everyone wanted it for their weight loss.... even with a proper diet, without the mounjaro my sugars averaged 250+ a1c went back up to 9, at that point i started a modified keto diet, and got them back down to 7.8, 

  
all breads carb smart tortillas carb smart etc. the occasional non miracle noodle(those things are nasty!) etc.

  
2 years ago i couldn;t move my arm without extreme pain, after thousands of dollars in tests to rule out the heart( i hate it when they do that because i kept saying I CANT MOVE MY SHOULDER OR ARM) a arm dr(can;t remember the name of said occupation) tried telling me i tore a rotator cuff and wants to do a 30 grand surgery, I didnt believe him, went for a second opinion...

  
THAT dr said ""you have diabetes?"" ... yes sir,, he had t2d aswell and asked me what i know about adhesive capsulitis(frozen shoulder) I said no, he said it is common in people with t2d diabetes he even gets it. gave me a shot(big mistake) and had me do exercises and see a pt, after about 6 months it went away..

  
the big mistake here is the steroid shot skyrocketed my blood sugar for 2 weeks, 400+ all day every day.. i won't get another one.

  
earlier this year i stopped smoking, as soon as i did the blood sugars went up. and stayed up for almost 2 months, drs couldn't figure it out, started smoking again and they went back down(this is the exact opposite of what is suppose to happen)

  
last month i got frozen shoulder on the other side, and without the shot it hurts like heeeeellllll.

  
Currently I am on 500mg of metformin twice a day, 5mg of mounjaro once a week, and a daily 2.5mg dose on tadalafil for the friend...

my a1c last Monday was 7.0

  
my fasting sugars run about 100, my spikes are 140 to 160, my nightly sleeping sugars unfortunately depending on when i eat dinner range from 140 to 225(i work late and often don't eat until about 10-11, then almost immediately fall asleep

  
for my diet i still only eat carb smart bread, when i have noodles or rice they are high is good fibers, portion control is key, i used to eat 2 to 3 giant plates now i barely eat a half a plate and have gone from 350 pounds down to 198.

I haven't had any caffeine in almost 2 years, stopped that cold turkey(and i love my coffee!) at one point i switched from 20+ kickstarts a day(before the t2d diag) to everything diet then kicked it all together.

  
my BIGGEST issue is when i stopped smoking my A1c went up, and me being a dumbass thought the mounjaro contributed(research showed those on insulin products have that effect and not really knowing what is in mounjaro...) nope sugars were still high dr kicked my ass for it too...

  
I have never had any issues with my feet. i mean at one point i dropped a washer and a sofa on both my big toes and screwed the nails up that should be removed at some point.

  
Then there is the retinopathy... the tests here are so damn expensive and since i didn't have any symptoms i never scheduled one(now my eye insurance i have covers diabetic eye exams)

  
september, i started seeing liquid floaters(mind you this was the second attempt to quit smoking and sugars rose)

  
so went and got a basic retinal exam, dr said he can see advanced retinopathy, and wanted me to see their retinal specialist asap the one in their office was booked for a month so i drove up to lansing to see the other, got there at 7, by 8 i was getting a angioplaty? or some shit to see the vessels in the eyes, by 830 am I got a shot in the right eye as there were quit a few bad grown vessels that were leaking(only one eye because A I drove myself and B i didn't know it would go that swiftly) I got the shot in my left a week later.

  
first shot didn't hurt second was painful as hell...

  
within a week new floaters disappeared, my next apt is in january because the floaters disappeared and it looked better he didn't do a shot in october.  of course I have minor floaters again now, but this one is my own fault, just because there are no visible symptooms, does NOT mean it is not happening.



  
some morals here..

  
push your dr, if the A1c would've been tested earlier I could've been handling it earlier...

keep an eye on your sugars, which is pretty easy now, I have used a freestyle libre sensor for 2? years now

  
that way you can know what spikes them and what doesn't.

  
I ate a slice of cheesecake yesterday and spike to 200, within an hour i was back down to 125.

  
I eat ice cream constantly(rebel, its expensive a hell for a pint but ZERO spikes and the impact on the sugars are minimal)

  
Don't wait, again if I would've listened and paid the 300.00 retinal exam fee every 6 months it could've been detected sooner, I may have to have **laser photocoagulation** but my insurance covers that with a copay of like 250 or 300(next year its even cheaper)



through my journey I have been told about ""other methods of controlling diabetes"" or thing of that nature, none of it at least for me is true. just take it one day at a time. even to be told by crazy people that mounjaro is made with snake venom and causes blindness and that it is not ment to take forever.

  
I feel fantastic, a couple scares throughout(numbness on one side of my head 4 years ago, possible heart attack last year etc(but all tests came back good, even the stress test) 

but these problems only surfaced after my employer forced me to get the jab and all subsequent boosters. to keep my job, and it's what actually pays the bills

  
I mean hands and legs are all scarred up, but that's because my 9-5 i move heavy furniture all day and after and on my days off I'm a licensed mobile mechanic, and if i drop something i use my legs to catch it.

  
and of course, get the A1c in line get high blood pressure which has been better since the axing of caffeine

  
as long as i keep doing what works for me, i 'll eventually be sub 5 A1C

  
unfortunately I still don't have full concentration back, and can't even do a simple sql command or function, I used to be able to code in object pascal, C# and C+ with my eyes closed, that is long gone.

  
but atleast I can still turn a wrench

1p9l4i2,"Rapid onset t2d in young teen, mostly treatment resistant.","Hello all, I'll be blatantly honest, I'm tired and exhausted and I don't know where to go but I just want to know if there's anyone else like me.

At 13 I was started on a low Fodmap diet to treat my IBS, it made me so sick I basically stopped eating (but due to being unable to see the doctor I was stuck on it for 5 months).  When this was done my A1C was checked and it was somewhere around the 5.5 range.  5 months later I was brought to the hospital (for what we now know are brainstem migraines), and my BS was 480ish (my A1C was nearly 12).  I was tested for a million different things because I wasn't in ketoacidosis and I was so young, but it wasn't autoimmune.  I was diagnosed with t2d after rapid weight gain (i grew 4in, went up 2 cup sizes and had my hips start filling in.  All my clothes still fit except in the hips and leg length).  It's been in my charts as a complication of obesity since it developed.

I want to be clear, I do two hours of intensive exercises a day, stick to a very strict doctor approved diet, and am very strict with my meds.  I've been this way since before I developed the condition.  Despite all of this my t2d is progressively worsening, I don't react normally to literally anything.  When my BS is high and not responding to insulin I eat cookie dough, don't ask me why but it'll usually drop a good 50+ points, at the same time I can take 30+ units of insulin and have barley any response.  I've been on ozempic since I was 15 (before that victoza), since then I've gained almost 50 lbs.  The fat on my body is so thin I can only use injections on a single part of my body unless I want to reach muscle (it's been observed and commented on by my Endo).  I can't do metformin or one of its alternatives because it literally killed my dad (for some reason my family suffers from severe liver failure when on that type of medication).  I'm on an insulin pump because my numbers don't come down with just ozempic (or just insulin).  It's getting worse as I get older, and it doesn't matter what I do it keeps getting worse.  My doctor keeps saying ""t2d in adolescence is weird, don't worry about it"" but I feel like shit 24-7 because the lowest I ever get is 120 (and this is being fully medicated and fasting for 24 hours).  None of my doctors will listen to me because my A1C is in healthy ranges (last check was 6.6), but to get that I spend all day every day adjusting my dosage.

I've been tested for MODY, turned up negative.  I have HEDS +co, an unexplained bleeding disorder (possibly endometriosis, but we're currently unsure), and the worst case of intractable brainstem migraine my doctors have seen.  I have a family history of t2d, on my dad's side literally everyone had it, on my mom's side both her and my grandpa had it.

I have chronically weird iron (sometimes low, sometimes weirdly dispersed, etc) due to the bleeding disorder, chronically high cortisol due to the constant dislocations and injuries, chronically low sodium (because I genuinely dislike the taste of salt.  IDK it's a sensory thing). I don't know who to talk to at this point.  I keep being told to ""eat better"", ""exercise more"", ""take my meds properly"" and when I point out that's being done and it's not changing anything, I just get shrugged off and told it's weird.  It's impacting my other aspects of care because every doctor is looking at it and going ""if your insulin resistance is worsening then you must not be listening to us/ taking care of your self"".  I've begged for a body comp exam (the main thing my docs are losing it over is my BMI) and they keep refusing me.  

I'm so tired of hating my body and how it works, I'm so tired of being scared, and I'm so tired of having no one like me to talk to.  Idk what to do ATP.

I’ve never had such bad control in my life. I’m not as rigid with myself as my dad was, but I’m not careless. My graphs typically stay good for 70-80% of the day most of the time, but the last few days they’ve consistently stayed at numbers like 12, 13, 14 no matter how much insulin I have. 

I’ve barely eaten beyond breakfast these days. I’ve been staying up to five in the morning just to make sure my numbers are finally coming down. My mouth tastes like acid reflux. 

I’m on a pump. I’ve changed the sight and today I adjusted my basal. I’m really freaking out. I’ve heard the stories of neuropathy and I want to mitigate any damage I can. I’m scared. I know it could just be outside factors or just a weird period of time but that doesn’t make me less scared. 

No clue how to end this. It’s bordering on 6am for me and I want to try to sleep if I can. Night y’all

1p9dkbw,Should I be more concerned about blood sugar spikes or overall average glucose?,"Forgive me. I just got diagnosed with type 2 earlier this year, and I'm still learning and trying to figure this all out. 

Several weeks ago, I started using a CGM so I could understand how different foods affect me, and look for patterns. One thing I have noticed is that about twice a week, on average, I will end up eating something for dinner that sends my blood sugar up into the 160s or low 170s mg/dl. It's always dinner, never any other meals or snacks. And it's usually foods I wouldn't expect to affect me like that. (For example, I have found that garden salads, regardless of the veggies or dressing, always send me into the low 170s. And twice, baked chicken breast with lemon and herbs and a side of broccoli has put me in the upper 160s.) It usually peaks around an hour after I eat, and returns to baseline after another hour or so. Seeing my blood sugar go that high kind of freaks me out, especially if it's caused by something I didn't expect, because I know too many spikes aren't good, and these are being caused by foods I didn't think would be problematic. 

On a side note, since I'm using a CGM, I've also been experimenting with different foods occasionally, and even though my blood sugar spikes are often higher (sometimes 180s or 190s) with those, it doesn't bother me as much, since it was a conscious decision on my part and it's just confirming my suspicion that a food goes on the ""no"" list. (Bye bye pasta.) Or I get a pleasant surprise and find out a suspect food is actually fine. (Like finding out, three times, a slice of pumpkin pie only puts me in the 130s!)

At the same time I'm concerned about these spikes, my meter says my 14 day and 1 month average are both 108.

So should I be concerned about these dinner spikes I get, or should I just take a deep breath and and not worry too much, since my average is good?

1q9wxp3,So I ate pizza last night and it went differently,"I was making 7” pizzas in my air fryer using regular dough, cheese, toppings, sauce. Nothing really low carb. Each crust would cook about 6 minutes at 400 F and then I would flip it over and add the toppings and cook another 4-7 minutes depending on how thick I got the cheese. When the first pizza was done I cut it into 4 pieces and sampled a slice while I was cooking the next pizza. I ate a slice from each pizza after it finished so maybe 10-20 minutes between each slice. I ate 4 slices by the end.

Usually pizza causes a spike so I expected something above 140 mg/ dL but it was only 117 when I checked my blood glucose. The only thing I can think of is that I was eating pretty slowly. I guess I never thought of eating more slowly being beneficial but I suppose it makes sense.

ETA- I use a finger stick meter so I can’t prove there was never a spike during the time I was not checking. When I eat pizza normally I would sit down with 2 slices and eat them one right after the other. I would check my blood sugar 2 hours after eating and see a much bigger increase than I saw last night. 

Often we are told to eat higher fiber carbs or combine them with protein and fats to slow absorption so I thought maybe eating slowly might also be slowing absorption.

So...my A1C has actually never been in ""full-blown"" diabetic range.

But...when I use a CGM occasionally,  I do stay ""in range"" like 98% of the time...but I am rarely or never below 100.  If I were a non-diabetic, shouldn't I be below 100?

I am also taking medication.  I was on Metformin for YEARS but finally got fed up with the constant daily diarrhea (yes I tried extended release).  So now I am on Farxiga and Januvia.  The Farxiga is also to protect my kidneys because I take Lithium for Bipolar Disorder.

So...if the medication is lowering my A1C, and my numbers on a CGM are almost never below 100, does that mean I really do have full-blown Type 2 Diabetes?  Or, since my A1C has never been above 6.5, am I still Pre-Diabetic?

Does it really matter actually?

1q7tvt6,T2 one common name but different to each individual.,"hi all, 

  
I share some thoughts as quite few asking me what kind of food do I eat, what kind of drinks do i drink, what kind of exercise do I maintain etc....

Medically, T2 is the ""label"" for everyone with type 2 diabetic but medication, diets, exercises, food/drink reaction, improvement, insulin resistance, insulin sensitivity etc are wildly different from person to person.

  
One kind of food might work with one person and might not work with the others. One regime of training / exercising might be effective with one person might not work at all to the others. It's because our ages, living conditions, metabolism, body's autonomic regulation are so different from one to another. Therefore, each of us need to carefully assess, measure, adjust and find our own threshold of carbs intake, form of exercise, duration of exercise, regime to work / rest / play / relax to SUIT each individual. Even with medication dosage, we often relying on our doctors and hardly ever asking questions of dosage but realistically and practically, the dosage needs to be monitored and revised meticulously via our own monitoring of our food intakes and our own BG daily. 

As a T2 person, you need to proactively play an active role in everything to mange and improve your health. There is no one shoe fit all.

  
To me personally, CGM is a god-sent device. CGM would help providing all BG stats every minute (delayed a few minutes comparing to the finger prick readings) and from the dataset of CGM, you can map out exactly what foods suit you, how much carbs (based on each kind of food and the mass of that kind of food), what timing of intaking and digesting, what kind of movement / exercise after meal etc are best for you. You need to go through the pain of noting everything down, analysing every details (you might want to use chatGPT for it to analyse the data if you are familiar with chatGPT). Once the results are analysed in the most concise and scientific way, you can stick with a personal regime based on that result.

Every 6 - 12 months, you might want to go through the same exercise again to map everything again (as your metabolism would have improved significantly by then), you might have new CGM dataset and from that, you might form new regime of your diets and exercises. The aim is to form the most sustainable / enjoyable way to manage your T2 without worrying, forcing, guessing and might end up with disappointing.

1q7n5kg,Need advice - vision and reccommended checkups,"Hello,

I've been a prediabetic for many years and a major surgery in 2024 took me over the threshold. I'm currently on Metformin 500 ER once a day and maintaining a1c under 6.0. Lost ~15lbs slow and steady and have more energy. So i think the diabetes control is working okay.

My biggest concern is my eyesight issues.

I am almost 50, have been wearing glasses since college and go for yearly checkup and get new glasses. 
For the last few years (since 2020 i think) I am noticing my vision deteriorating. It is a bit difficult to explain. So I go to Costco or other optometrist, get my eyes checked and get new glasses made with that power. Intially it feels like i see better but then my vision is back to being bad. I struggle with distance vision. The near vision is fine (i do lot of sewing, embrodery etc. without any trouble) but it is hard to read things on TV esp specific fonts. 

I am losing my confidence while driving as I'm not sure I will be able to read signs well ahead of time. These days i strictly avoids freeways, and stick to well-known roads nearby my home within 10 miles max. Thankfully I work remote so this hasn't affected my day to day... yet. In a recent air travel I had tought time reading the displays and finding my flight n gate etc. Thankfully had my family with me.

My next PCP visit is mid-Feb and I am planning to ask her to suggest what to do about this, and fpr a referral to a specialist or something. I did ask her the same last year and she just said optometrist check is enough.

Hoping someone had similar experience can guide me in deciding what questions to ask my PCP, what kind of specialist I ask referral for to make sure comprehensive checks are done considering T2. And when I wear glasses of suggested power I can actually see better and be confident enough to drive and travel without worries.",1767904448.0,3,18,diabetes_t2,diabetes
1q7khez,Tasty low carb recipe,"One of my biggest laments is some of the limited options I have for meals between t2 and Mounjaro making my stomach tiny. So I’m always combing my pre-BeatUs recipes for low carb options. 

I made Rasta Pasta today with red lentil pasta. And realized it doesn’t need the pasta. But then it would just be “Rasta”. Low carb and much taste. 

I make with chicken breast

The worst carb “offender” in the recipe are the bell peppers. And pasta - but I don’t even eat it :)

I make my own jerk seasoning as I have an allium sensitivity and bottled seasoning contains onion and garlic 

**Rasta Pasta**

\* 2 tablespoons olive oil or vegetable oil

\* 1 small onion chopped

\* 1 green bell pepper sliced (I used jalapenos instead to spice it up a bit, or add in a Scotch Bonnet for extra heat)

\* 1 red bell pepper sliced

\* 1 orange bell pepper sliced

\* 3 cloves garlic chopped

\* 1 tablespoon Jamaican jerk seasoning

\* 14 ounces fire roasted tomatoes OPTIONAL: I used canned – diced tomatoes are great, too, canned or fresh

\* 1 cup coconut milk - heavy cream is an acceptable alternative, yet won’t bring that coconut flavor

\* 1 cup of grated fresh Parmesan cheese or more as needed

\* 8 ounces fettuccine pasta

\* FOR GARNISH: Fresh chopped parsley spicy chili flakes, extra grated Parmesan cheese

Instructions

FOR THE RASTA PASTA

\* Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pan and add the onion and peppers. Cook them down about 5 minutes to soften.

\* Add the garlic and 1 tablespoon Jamaican jerk seasoning. Cook for 1 minute, stirring.

\* Add the tomatoes and stir. Cook for 5 minutes to cook down the tomatoes.

\* Add the coconut milk and simmer for 5 minutes to thicken up. If it get too thick, swirl in a few tablespoons of water or chicken stock.

\* Stir in the Parmesan cheese and remove from heat.

\* While the Rasta Pasta is simmering, cook the fettuccine noodles according to the package directions. Drain and toss with the sauce.",1767898617.0,3,2,diabetes_t2,diabetes

A bit of background i haven't had any bloods done in my 30s and i have always had an active job and still now im on my feet for 8 hours a day.

However in last 5 years my ex wife got me 15k in debt and after only 7 years 6 month of marriage 3 times finding debt i bailed out, met another woman with my now stepdaughter, and with in 2 years brought a house together. After 6 months in our family home, my stepdaughter was diagnosed with cancer on her wind pipe and had a full laryngectomy and life changing surgery was in children's hospital with mum unpaid for 6 momths.(shes ok now) 👍 

So life has been incredibly stressful i suffer with anxiety, depression is in my history but my new family helped me beat the depression part and im no longer medicated.

However my diet has been poor, id drink most weekends all weekend binge drinking just to help get by.

My question is I drank before the blood work in April 2024 when I got the 43mmol I didnt fast and didn't even remotely take it seriously because Ive no family history of it other than my grandad and dad's brother not parents. 

Now in these 8 months im eating alot better, I still drink alcohol on weekends, but I move each day, walking outside or walking pad or work. Drink 2 litres of water most days, I haven't cut carbs out I do eat wraps white, pasta and rice.

Diagnosed at 7.1 in March 2025. 35 YO male. Was 210 lbs.

=> 5.0 in July => 5.1 in September => and 4.8 today at latest labs. 750 mg metformin a day.

Went really really low carb. STRICT keto from diagnosis until July. It helped tremendously.

Lost 55 lbs and obviously got those BG numbers down. I never really counted my carbs tbh, but just aimed for as low as possible. (I would stress about 2 carbs in a Gatorade Zero..)

My labs in Sept. had really high cholesterol. Quite high - super high in almost all of it.

After September in particular I really started backing off keto some. Added in eating small amounts of real bread, some fruit, small bites of dessert, more “keto” breads tortillas, ect.

I feel so much better at about ~75 ish carbs a day than >20 where I was. Bowl  movements so much better. Less stressed about eating. More fun eating out, being present instead of stressing about carb counting.

I still watch what I do closely. I still test in the morning about 5 days a week. Have weight stabilized since July. And feel good. Cholesterol numbers were a lot more normal this round, too.

HOWEVER, when I asked if I should be monitoring my glucose just so I know how I react to certain foods and also to avoid dips or spikes he mentioned that I don't need to monitor for now.

My hba1c was 9% and my fasting glucose was 153.69 mg/dL which to me is already soooo high.. shouldn't I be monitoring? He also mentioned I should maintain a caloric daily intake of 1200kcal / day which to me is also very low considering my height of 169cm at currently 114kg...

Since getting the DX I'm on insulin and I take it as prescribed. I've been changing my diet so that most of my carbs are now coming from fruits and non-starchy vegetables. I do at least 15 minutes of cycling a day. And it is just. Life? 

I'm writing this because I feel like my reaction is the weird one. I should be freaking out or feeling way worse than I do. But instead I have been very calm and matter of fact about it. 

I didn't think much of that reaction at the time because I figured the gravity would hit me later when I'm not on a bunch of IV antibiotics and didn't just get released from the hospital after minor surgery. But it's been since September. And it's just integrated into my life.

Maybe it is because it was the answer to a question I didn't know I had, and once I got on insulin I started feeling better than I had in a long time. So it was like ""ok this is a piece of the puzzle""?

Now with a new job, I'm back to Anthem but my employer has a plan that does not cover CGMs unless I use insulin, so I am looking into Lingo, Stelo and other options.

If you have used them, can you share your experience? I assume a Stelo would work similar to a G7, but am suspicious of whether it has a lower quality than a G7.

1q3ifsd,Transitioning to maintenance after lowering A1C,"After receiving an A1C result of 6.8 on November 26, I overhauled my diet by drastically cutting carbs and sugar. I also started riding my Peloton for 30 minutes daily (burning \~400 calories). Since then, I’ve dropped from 192 lbs to 176 lbs, and my recent home test shows my A1C is already down to 5.9.

I’ve cut out bread, pasta, potatoes, rice, desserts, sugary coffee creamers, and alcohol, focusing entirely on proteins and vegetables. I plan to get formally retested in late February, hoping the full 90-day window will reflect even better results (ideally in the low 5s).

My question is: Once I hit my goal, how can I safely reintroduce carbs and sugar without sliding back into pre-diabetic levels? I don't think I can sustain strict keto forever. I’m considering having dessert, pasta, or bread just once or twice a month—which is still far less than my previous routine.

im not talking about extreme diet plans or cutting everything out completely. more like everyday food that are easy to prepare, not stressful to eat, and dont cause big spikes. ive searched around but a lot of advice feels either too strict or way too vague, so im left wondering what food are easy to eat for a diabetic person in real life, not just on paper.

this is for someone who eats pretty normal home cooked meals. rice is common, some meat, vegetables, occasional snacks. cooking complicated recipes every day isnt realistic, so simple and sustainable options matter a lot more than perfection. also trying to avoid food that feels like punishment because thats just not gonna last long term.

for those dealing with this personally or helping family, what foods actually worked for you. what are your go to meals or snacks that didnt feel restrictive. were there foods you thought were fine but ended up causing issues. and when you think about what food are easy to eat for a diabetic person, what made the biggest difference day to day.

I am currently on very low carb (carbs only in green veggies) and a tiny bit of dairy in my tea. 

I have a journal where I log my blood after eating, working out, etc. I am seeing that most nights I catch my blood rising right before bedtime. 

I eat twice a day: once breakfast soon after waking and a large veggie+protein meal in the evening.

in 2025 i struggled and went a little off the rails and ended up at 7.8.

After researching this online it is apparently pretty common among Mounjaro users once you hit steady state at 7.5mg or higher.

I go to bed at the same time as always (9-10), and am out within moments of closing my eyes. Then like clockwork I wake up around 2am - not a sleepy rub my eyes wake up but a full awake instantly and feel as refreshed as I used to feel after 8-10 hours.  I described it to my wife as ""losing the gradients"" and instead of feeling tired, drifting to sleep, drifting awake, and waking up I'm now either fully awake or fully asleep with no in-between state.

1q1z3ec,Update on Recent Diagnosis,"This is my first post on Reddit as I normally come on just to check things out. At the end of September, I went to the emergency room, experiencing symptoms of what I eventually found out was Type 2 diabetes. I could barely walk into the hospital and to be perfectly honest, I wasn’t going to the doctor and maintaining a healthy lifestyle like I should have been. My A1C was at a 14.1 and the doctors told me my blood sugar was over 1000. They immediately put me on an insulin drip and I was in ICU for 4 out of the 5 days I was in the hospital.

Upon discharge, I was prescribed 50 units of Lantus, twice daily, 20 units of Novolog before meals, and a dose of metformin before meals. However, the hospital told me I didn’t need to take the Novolog or metformin if my blood glucose was below 120 mg/dL. I was also prescribed a blood glucose monitor to prick my fingers 4 times a day.

Now here’s the update. I’ve been seeing my PCP more often, prioritizing my health and managing my diabetes. I have nothing but great things to say about my doctor and his practice. I no longer take any of the medications I listed above (the Lantus pens were a pain and they kept getting stuck). They switched me to Tresiba, which I take 36 units once a day (stark contrast from the 100 units I was taking in October). I also wear a Dexcom G7, which for the most part I like and it lessens the number of times I prick my finger.

The doctor also prescribed me Mounjaro as I expressed interest in losing weight. I’m currently taking 7.5mg. Since June 2025, I have lost a total of 60lbs (this was a combination of being sick, the Mounjaro and change in diet. Just factoring the Mounjaro and change in diet, I lost 30lbs in 2 months).

I also visited a diabetes and nutrition center that the hospital referred me to. I took a class learning about diabetes and proper eating on diabetes. I had two other appointments with a nurse that works there and she was amazing. My last visit in early December, she told me I only need to come back as needed, that she sees me possibly going off insulin, and that she hasn’t seen a success story like mine in a long time.

Now for the big news since you all are probably wondering (or maybe not lol). What is my A1C currently? As of December 24th, 2025, my A1C is at 5.4! I was so excited to see that number! I’ve come along way since that 14.1 on September 28th. I visited my PCP on December 31st and he said he was proud of how far I’ve come

I know there are some things I still need to work on, like the motivation to exercise, but I’m so proud of the results. Also, an endocrinologist referral will probably happen in the future.

1q1x8vi,Thoroughly confused this week after letting loose during the holidays.,"Hi, 

So I was diagnosed with Type 2 in early November. Had an A1C of 11.7. I was scared, but knew I had to make big changes. I decided to go without meds and try lifestyle changes first. I lost about 20-25lbs, went on a very low carb diet (not keto but not far from it either), ate no added sugar during this time, walking almost daily, and then taking some supplements (Berberine, Garlic, Magnesium, and Cinnamon along with my multivitamins and collagen that I have always taken)

All of that stuff was working for me, after the first week I was floating around 100 at the highest, and then for the past month I have consistently been seeing myself in the 80s and 90s, and some 70s here and here on my BG monitor, only time I would ever see 100s is dawn phenomenon in the morning which would be like 103-105 at worst before going back down to double digits. 

During the week of Christmas Eve and New Years, I decided to enjoy the holidays, and let go a little bit. I ate a ton of carbs, mac & cheese, mini calzones, pizza, ramen, potatoes, sandwiches, fried foods, bread, etc. When I had my first meal on Christmas Eve, I was happy to be eating regular food, but also worried about how high my blood sugar was going to go. But this is where it gets confusing, I checked after 60 minutes, and then again at 2 hours after eating. The highest I saw my blood sugar at that time, was 88, I was stunned. 

That then prompted me to let loose a bit, and had some of the foods I listed before during the course of this past week to keep testing and see how my blood sugar responds, almost all of it after 1 and 2 hours, I was still in double digits, some 80s, and some 90s, some I did multiple tests at the same time. I did have one spike that was short lived, but that was 115 which is still not that bad. 

I just don't understand, I am not on meds, and a few days also forgot my supplments. I had a high A1C, I can't help but wonder if something threw the blood work off and maybe I was misdiagnosed, but I do not believe that is the case, since the A1C is a 3month average, so even though the year prior to it I ate very unhealthy and frequently, I know that is very unlikely. Can the lifestyle changes really make such a big difference is such a short time? This is obviously a good thing, I have just been shocked cause my body is acting like it is not even diabetic even though it is.

1q1evum,Not feeling well after eating,"Happy new year all! Ive been diabetic for over 9 months now and have decided to really take this seriously in the beggining of November. Ive been on a relatively low-carb carb diet for 2 months now. In these two months i have had most days under 130g of carbs. Some days I am under 100 and once or twice a week I am over 130. My A1C at the end of October was 5.6. Im betting now my A1C is lower now but i honestly have felt like crap after ive been eating. I dont always feel like crap after every meal but id say that recently its been like 75% of the time after I eat a meal. This includes after i eat either low or relatively high carb foods as well. I dont know whats going on. When I dont feel good I would describe it as a mild headache and a disorientated feeling. Like sort of a nauseous feeling without the puking.

For context, I ate relatively unhealthy for diabetic standards between July and the end of October and I felt like crap way less than I did now. I started Metformin 500mg at the beginning of November and noticed it made me feel bad for like ten days and then that sort of went away but in the middle of November I started reacting negatively to foods even when they weren't that bad for diabetes. I also weighed 300 pounds at the beggining of November and now im 256 with my diet change. I also rarely work out.

My carbs have been lower than before, my protein intake is good but not too high, my fiber has gone up but what my issue has been for all of my life, honestly, has been fats - especially saturated fats. I really like mixed nuts, meat and cheese. I most certainly have more than I should but its hard to stop!

Ive been taking my blood glucose on most days starting in the beggining of November. I do it around one to three times for most days a week. Ive never once had a high reading, before or after ive eaten. If my glucose meter is accurate and im measuring it correctly, then why am I feeling like this? My post meal numbers are between high 80s and 130s. I measure anywhere between 30 minutes to 2 hours after my meal.

Like this morning I ate cheese and meat as well as broccoli, a small cucumber and a very small amount of bread. In total this was probably around 30g of carbs or so. The saturated fat was probably high though. I then started to feel shitty after 20 minutes and then even worse at like the one to two hour mark.

I have a message in to my doctor already but I'm feeling so frustrated. I'm autistic and ADHD and I struggle with hunger cues and poor appetite a lot, and I have really dramatic blood sugar symptoms.  Even as a child I was hypersensitive to changes, lows between meals, and later reactive hypoglycemia for most of my adult life. 

Lately I've been feeling side effects of (what feels like) more rapid changes in blood sugar. I don't have a CGM and I'm only supposed to take my morning number each day, but I have been trying to check trends when I start feeling crappy. I get irritable, nauseous, brain fog, just general icky feeling. Today I had a protein/carb breakfast and went from 100 to 149 within ten minutes and then ten minutes later had gone back down to 137. I felt awful. I had another small spike about an hour later with the physical symptoms. This evening an hour after a very small dinner (lettuce, two gyoza, and one small chicken piece with some broth) I went from 82 to 111 to 79 in like 15 minutes.

I would say it's been around one or two months looking back but I didn't notice the pattern at first.

T2 to me, is a constant reminder that I must live healthy by taking everything moderately, not excessively.  I can drink, I can eat, I can enjoy life responsibly, not impulsively.

I do not need to finger prick crazily or watch CGM app obsessively anymore. I do not need to worry about what to eat, what to drink because I've spent months to check and recalibrate my system with different foods, different exercises, different regime of work, rest, play etc. Once I've found my threshold, I maintain it because it's completely sustainable.

You can do too.

\- Cabot Special Reserve Cheddar

\- Alouette Spinach Artichoke cheese spread 

\- Vermont Creamery Blueberry Thyme Goat Cheese

2 varieties of hummus

Fresh Raspberries 

Carb balance wrap chips (high fiber wraps, sprayed with olive oil, lightly salted, crisped in the oven for 7-10 minutes at 350 degrees F).

Meats:

\-Uncured salami (2 varieties)

\-Prosciutto 

\-two or three other small cuts of uncured charcuterie-type meats 

Seltzer to drink,

And a friend made pumpkin olive oil cake with swerve brand alternative sweetener (I’ve had it before, it’s divine).

I’m sure folks will bring other things to snack on, but this will cover me while allowing me to share with others!

Any ideas for future get-togethers? What works for you?",1767224284.0,10,10,diabetes_t2,diabetes

I'm still recovering from burnout of academic life that ended in trauma, I can't work jobs without getting PTSD (all I can manage is freelancing gigs), and I am pretty sure my yearlong dependence on a certain antipsychotic medication fucked my metabolism right in the ahh and contributed to my diabetes.

Mentally I am not doing okay. I can't eat any of my safe food. Not because of portion size or anything, but my almond mom restricts my diet like a prisoner. My diet consists of chicken wraps and only chicken wraps. I'd sneak bits of fruits at night when I inevitably starve, and she would say I'm not even trying to take care of myself. Plus, even after switching to a long acting glucophage, I projectile vomit from both ends in the regular, and it really discourages me from taking my meds regularly.

Finger sticks are sensory hell. My whole life, needle give me panic attacks. I exclusively prick only on my right hand because I play violin and playing after prick feels like I have pins and needles on my fingertips. CGMs costs 250 per replacement, which is a lot for my household, and I have no insurance.

I am so close to surrendering myself to a hospital and letting professionals take care of my diabetes and my mental sanity.

I’m not taking meds and in remission for two years and not worrying about it is on me, but the numbers don’t lie. This not just CGM weirdness, my numbers are backed up with finger sticks. 

Example, the other night I decided to have one glass of red wine. Started a bit over 100 (had a couple of low carb wraps with some deli meats before I went out) when I sat down and didn’t even finish a 5oz pour in an hour’s time. Went home and boom I’m at 73. I understand the process, but can’t figure out if I’m overreacting. I never feel the 70’s (I hit 65 once or twice early on getting my numbers right and didn’t feel it one bit) until I see the 70s. If it was a normal day and I haven’t had anything to eat I’d look at that 73 and be happy. While I’m sleeping and wake up and decide to check and see that number I’m happy as a pig in you know what. Seeing it after a bit of booze paranoia sets in and I freak out. So I corrected it and then was fine, no more drops. 

How unusual is it that I drop that fast? I’m assuming this has happened to me a lot before I started checking my numbers while I was prediabetic and even when I was in the 6.9 range. I would often go out drinking without any food for hours and never had an issue.

1pz273o,How I Maintain an A1C Below 5.0 Without Hypoglycemia or Restrictive Eating,"Disclaimer: I’m not a doctor — just sharing my personal experience and what has worked for me. 

My last three A1C results are 5.6, 5.1, 4.6.  The last lab results showing an A1C of 4.6%, surprised my doctor. For context, most adults my age without diabetes hover around 5.0%, so this is lower than average. I want to share how I manage this without extreme dieting, fasting, or hypoglycemia.

Key strategies that work for me:

Balanced meals with protein and fiber – Every meal includes a good protein source and fiber-rich foods (beans, greens, chia, oats). This slows glucose absorption and stabilizes energy.

Strategic carb timing – Higher-carb foods are timed around training or activity, so the body uses glucose efficiently.

Hydration & electrolytes – Staying well-hydrated helps maintain glucose control and supports metabolic flexibility.  I average 15 cups of water a day and get 95% of my daily electrolytes.   On high sodium days I boost my water to 17 cups.

Regular exercise – Resistance and full-body workouts improve insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake into muscle.

Stress management & sleep – Cortisol spikes temporarily raise glucose; mindfulness, proper sleep, and low-stress routines help maintain balance.

Tracking trends, not obsession – I log food and activity but focus on patterns, not perfection. Occasional indulgences are fine; my system handles them.

Results I’ve experienced:

Fasting glucose usually in the mid-80 and 90s

Can handle higher-carb “refeed” meals without spiking

Stable body weight and energy

A1C consistently <5.0

Takeaway:

High metabolic flexibility and thoughtful lifestyle choices can maintain excellent glucose control without the extremes people often think are required. This isn’t medical advice — just what’s worked for me.",1767052064.0,129,59,diabetes_t2,diabetes

I have a new doctor appt on the 6th, but it's just been such a long journey to even get here, I'm beyond mentally exhausted.

1pyw93c,Terrified of having diabetes type 2,"EDIT: thank you everyone for being so kind :(

Hey everyone

I'm 25, female. I was having massive back pain last month and went to the doctor. After some talking, she suggested running a few tests in January. She asked me if I want to include checking for diabetes (I'm obese) and I very reluctantly agreed.

I don't think that I have any symptoms, but I've been worried about diabetes for years already. I'm absolutely convinced that I have it. I also suffer from PCOS, and live a sedentary lifestyle. I've been wanting to change that, workout, lose weight, but my mental health has been pretty meh for a decade already, and I've failed every attempt so far to better myself.

I'm honestly feeling really bad already. I'm scared of getting the diagnosis, and having to go to the doctor repeatedly from then on. I'm ashamed because I know it's my own fault. I'm lazy, and use food for comfort. I know it's dumb and wrong and that it will give me health issues. I'm beating myself up after every meal, and have been doing so since my early teens where I started to pack on weight. I guess I have a really messy relationship with food. Idk.

If I get the diagnosis, I want to hide it somehow. I don't want to tell my family or my friends. In my country, type 2 is treated as a huge joke, and people always get mocked for it, because it's a fat people disease. I already have very low self-esteem.

I understand that I'll have to life a carb-free or low-carb life. That sucks, doesn't it??? I want to go to Japan so bad, have sushi, and ramen, and all the other delicious stuff they got there. I want to have pizza. A bowl of spaghetti. My friends and I love checking out new restaurants or visit food markets. But I won't be able to do that ever again without worrying.

I'm feeling really down. I can't stop thinking about it. I'm so afraid that I already got some sort of nerve damage or whatever. ​

1pxy21o,Looking for hope and motivation to keep radical lifestyle changes,"Hello everyone, I'm new here (M 44, 6' tall, 219 pounds, or 1,83 m and 99,5 kg). I've been recently diagnosed with T2 diabetes through an oral glucose tolerance test ordered by an endocrinologist. She just called me to tell me the diagnose, and we'll talk about the results in the end of January. Since it's a serious illness, I obviously got very worried and started getting information anywhere I could.

I’m including some data for reference, but what I’m actually looking for is hope.

I had ChatGPT analyse the blood work (HbA1C 5.7, HOMA 5.2, 15.8 fasted insulin), and it said that the relatively low HbA1C could be caused by very high insulin levels. The OGTT showed a high increase in BS (248) after one hour, accompanied by very high insulin (143), followed by a normal BS (86) and lower insulin (32) after two hours.

The HOMA beta cell activity is at 83%, which probably means my pancreas has not yet been seriously damaged. So I reckoned it’s now or never.

I’ve started a very low-carb diet, motivated by sheer despair, eating mostly fish, whey protein (without additives) with creatine, cinnamon and psyllium husk, some cheese and almonds, and lots of low-carb vegetables baked with olive oil. I fixed my sleep and have been doing intermittent fasting 18/6, sometimes 20/4. In 3 weeks I lost 13 pounds (6 kg), most of which is probably water, but my visceral fat index fell from 15 to 13, which is the best news. My BS is always lower than 100 when I wake up.

I intend to keep this diet, because I feel like there’s a gun pointed at my head. I have three kids and want to be healthy for them. I love eating, but I’ve found pleasure in those meals, because I’m not tired after eating anymore and my hunger is very controlled.

My question is: is there hope? If not for remission, for a good control, since I probably discovered the disease at an early stage? I’ve read some comments of people that adopted radical changes in lifestyle and seem to have the disease under control.

Could anyone please share their experience with life changes and how to find motivation to keep them going, either through fear or hope?

1pxc1f1,"Over the last 7-8 months huge body changes resulting in much lower CGS/stick readings, having anxiety about low numbers","I'm looking for gentle support and conversation please. I'm a very sensitive person. <3

I've been T2 for 10-15 years (it's hard for me to wrap my head around when I was diagnosed.)

When diagnosed, I weighed around 335 pounds. Over a year with some major life changes I dropped to around 260 pounds. I was put on the usual metformin and statin regiment.

I spent the following decade convincing myself it wasn't ""that bad"" and never doing finger sticks or making any major lifestyle changes. Wound up with terrible neruopathy below the calves, even wound up losing a toe on my left foot (indirectly due to diabetes; I can elaborate if you really want to know.)

It was only in the last 4-5 years I went on a basal insulin every evening, which helped with my health, but as of 8 months ago I was still in the 255 pound zone. I was on jardiance, basal insulin, gabapentin and meloxicam for neuropathy pain, and the metformin.

My ""normal"" blood sugar range was 200 and going above 300 wasn't uncommon.

After a struggle to try Ozempic that made me violently ill, I switched to Mounjaro and my life has changed.

I currently weigh about 200 pounds. I have turned to a high protein, low carb lifestyle. For the last numerous months my ""normal"" blood sugar readings rarely went above 150. I am more active, happier. I am off insulin and jardiance and my doctor is ready to take me off of metformin.

**However...** roughly five months ago while still on my basal insulin I had a terrifying hypoglycemia incident that has left me traumatized. It was in the evening when I had just injected, and suddenly and rapidly my readings dropped to below 70 and falling. I was sweating and confused, couldn't swallow properly, and as I had never experienced anything NEAR what was going on I only even knew it was blood sugar related due to the alarm from my CGM. I basically guzzled maple syrup - the only high carb thing I had in my entire home - and came out of the other side terrified.

Cut to my situation right now. Over the last few weeks, my ""normal"" readings seem to rarely break 100 and regularly dip down into the 80s. Right now as I'm typing this my reading shows 81, and that is after having recently eaten a balanced 400 calorie meal.

Despite the fact that objectively speaking I know this is a healthy and safe number, I have had CGM warning notifications at least once a day for the last week, often at nighttime when I'm sleeping, showing a steep drop into the 70s. I have taken to keeping a bottle of honey bedside because I haven't had a chance to go buy glucose tabs (winter storm.)

The whole thing is freaking me out and I just wish I had some kind of support around the situation and how to handle it. Seeing the number 81 \*REALLY FREAKS ME OUT\*. I see it and I think, well...I better stuff my face with carbs or within an hour it will be at 60 and then I'll die.

1pwpc4o,Curious about whether my diagnosis has been handled normally?,"Hi all,

First time poster in this subreddit, and I'd really love some advice on how my diagnosis has been handled. For context, I'm from the UK but have lived in the US since September 2024. \*\*There is a TL:DR at the bottom!\*\*

**Lil bit of history:**

I had a suspected diagnosis of PCOS from the age of 12/13. Ever since that age, I've struggled with losing weight no matter what I did - no amount of physical exercise or diet helped. My A1C came back a bit high when I was 17 (over a decade ago), but not high enough for my GP to be that concerned. Both my maternal grandmother and my father were diagnosed with Type 2 when I was a kid. My Dad, honestly, has never looked after himself: drinking soda, smoking, and eating like a kid in a candy shop every single day, which has been really distressing to me. So from a young age I started to research diabetes and what he should be eating, and tried to convince him to go low carb, but he wouldn't listen to me.

Flash forward to university, and I still couldn't lose weight but I still hadn't been able to get a PCOS diagnosis on the NHS. During lockdown, I decided to test my theory about low carb diets and switched to keto...I lost 4 stone in 3 months and felt great. Until I wasn't. The rapid weight-loss caused my cholesterol to sky rocket, and it caused serious gallbladder issues. I had to have it taken out after a year of hell, where I put a lot of the weight back on because I was scared to eat like that again and had an accident so was in crutches for months. It was during an ultrasound for my gallbladder removal that I was, finally, diagnosed with PCOS. No treatment was given and no specialist was ordered.

In 2023, I took part in a medical trial with an endocrinologist out of desperation to be heard. He said my A1C and glucose test was fine, but when I had to drink a sugary liquid to test my blood, he was concerned it was in pre-diabetic range. He diagnosed me with insulin resistance and ordered my GP to put me on preventative metformin, lest I progress to diabetes stage. My GP said no because the referral hadn't come from her, and she refused to refer me to an endo. It's important to note that with trying to sort my visa for the US, as well as crippling untreated ADHD, I found it very hard to advocate for myself back then.

Flash forward to now, where I live in the US. This is what I'd love advice on. It took a lot of convincing, but a gynae prescribed me metformin XR in March. Unfortunately, I physically could not swallow the tablet after weeks of trying and asked for the liquid. She refused and said I needed to see an endo - I joined the waitlist, which was 9 months. In the meantime, she cancelled my prescription.

After being diagnosed with ADHD the week before Thanksgiving, I went to see my PCP for a steroid clearance. She took one look at me and went into overdrive. She said the most awful things about my weight, and sent me off for a whole heap of blood tests - but only if I hadn't had metformin recently (?! I didn't realise you had to stop taking all diabetes medication for an A1C test?)!. My A1C came back as 6.5. My fasting glucose was 120. Right on the cusp, so I was diagnosed with Type 2.

This is where things get weird.

Instead of talking to me about a blood glucose monitor, or what to do at all, she spent the whole appointment telling me I needed to have gastric bariatric surgery to lose weight immediately. I tried telling her the truth: that I generally eat very low carb, I exercise a lot (I swim 2-3 times a week when the unheated pool is warm enough to swim in, I do tai chi, I play flag football on the weekends, and I try to walk as close to 10,000 steps per day as I can). But she didn't believe me at all.

So, now, I've tried to book an appointment with the endo again, but the waitlist is full until early April. That's 5.5 months of no diabetes management or advice whatsoever.

The metformin (1000mg) liquid she prescribed is ruining my life - I'm chained to the toilet and get dangerous feelings like I'm drunk or going to pass out if I don't eat any carbs. Just the other day my Mum had to grab some glucose tablets because the world started swimming.

I have tried, relentlessly, to do the finger prick with a glucose monitor that my Mum brought over from the UK for Christmas (I've had ZERO advice or guidance from anyone about it or testing at all) and I've had terrible luck with it: no matter how warm my hands are or how hard I press down, I can't much  blood out, it takes 15+ attempts each time, and it's painful. I asked my PCP for a CGM prescription to be sent to Costco as I had a free coupon to try one and I wanted to know what's going on with the weird dizzy spells and seeing what's spiking me, and she said no! I need to wait for the Endo apparently, which is nearly half a year away.

My PCP has demanded I go back for an appointment for another A1C test in early January to see how I'm getting on, but I'm confused...I thought it was every 3 months? But that's only just over 1.5 months, so what's the point in that?

In the meantime, she said she referred me to the diabetic nutrionist and the nutrionist on campus...she didn't, she only referred me to the non-diabetic one. I did go to see the nutrionist though, and she said how I'm eating now (very low carb) is perfect! I asked her for some ideas for freezer meals I can grab as I have a full schedule as a grad student and TA next quarter, and she told me to 'eat 1/16th of the Trader Joe's teriyaki chicken bowl' out of the freezer. I think that's insane advice, how is that enough food? And who can possibly gauge what 1/16th of a frozen meal is?

Since then, I've had no less than SEVEN missed calls asking me to schedule my consultation for my bariatric surgery to have my stomach shrunk because, as this PCP said: 'This will help you stop overeating too many calories'. I kept trying to tell her: I don't overeat at all! My spouse eats the exact same food as I do, moves less, yet she's perfectly healthy. So clearly, something is going on. My PCP also told me if she referred me, I didn't have to follow up, so I'm confused about why they keep calling me. My therapist, also on campus in the same medical system, has never heard of anyone being called directly to arrange an appointment, and has shared concerns that her other students who have been diagnosed as diabetics have never been treated like this.

This is a very long-winded post, but **TL:DR** what I'm asking for is advice and experiences on  whether my PCP's handling of my diagnosis (refusal to send over a CGM prescription, no information on glucose machines and daily testing, waiting almost 6 months for Endo to give me any information, and pushing bariatric surgery on me) is normal?

For context, I'm 28F with a BMI of 37 (down from 39.5. I've lost 20 pounds in three weeks since FINALLY being prescribed metformin that I can swallow).

Please can you give me any advice, I'm genuinely so sad that this PCP has left me in the lurch and is adamant I need major stomach surgery to 'stop overeating' when that's really not what's going on here at all. I think i'm pretty knowledgeable about diabetes now from my year's of research and I just can't wrap my head around whether this is normal or not?! I'm so nervous about trying to tackle this on my own for the next six months without being able to get accurate readings on what's spiking me.",1766811737.0,1,19,diabetes_t2,diabetes
1pwl50m,Weird blood sugar behavior in a good way?,"I've been diagnosed for almost 10 years now, luckily it was caught early enough that I've just needed to take metformin and other oral medication and my doctor is confident that one day I might be able to go without even that in the future.

I've followed a relatively strict diet in that time mostly following keto because I'm terrible with vegetables, something I'm working on, but the one thing I've been very strict on is sugar and carbs, bread I avoid as much as possible using keto substitutes and anything sugary like candy, cake, or other sweets I avoid entirely.

This Christmas though I attended 3 different parties, two work parties and my extended family get together and decided to splurge for once and ate basically an entire chocolate pie, some cookies, and fudge at each. Now I did fast before each meal basically eating nothing the night before until the party itself but I was still expecting a good sugar spike from this.

To my honest surprise and shock each time I tracked my sugar level with my libre sensor and saw I never even spiked above 200, and yes it stayed up around 180 for a couple hours but it didn't take long for it to go back around 100 the same night.

On the other hand if I even think of having a can of tomato or chicken soup with a couple crackers crushed into it I'm immediately pushing 250 after eating. 

What exactly is going on are sugary treats like pie and cookies really less intensive on my sugar levels than something processed like canned soup?

I was on Metformin and Trulicity in the past but had such trouble with GI issues (mostly frequent and multiple episodes of diarrhea that I had to stop both of them and GI issues resolved while maintaing decent A1C levels.

Recently my physician wanted me to start Monjaro 2.5 mg.  I have taken now for 4 weeks. 

The good news is that I am able to use a little less insulin both in the AM and the PM.  My Blood sugars have been lower at night after dinner so that is good.

The bad news is that the GI issues are about to get me to quit.

I usually take on Sunday morning and by Sunday afternoon I am bloated and start having reflux, heartburn, burping and constipation.  This is all worse by Monday and sleeping is not good at all,

I take MiraLAX, Senokot and Tums and they don't seem to do any good.  By Tuesday everything starts to get back to normal.  I do well the rests of the week and then repeat.

I reached out to Lilly who could only confirm that yes these are frequent side effects.  They said discuss with my doctor.

I think that things seem better at week 4 from week 1, but I cannot see staying on this long term if these symptoms don't improve or hopefully go away altogether.

I do not need to lose weight, though losing about 10 pounds would be nice.  I don't think switching to another company's product would make much difference.

Looking to see if others have figured out a way to combat these side effects or reassurance that yes these will abate over time.

  
Thank you for your input. If this has been discussed elsewhere, I am sorry as I do not know how to search this way but if so, please direct me to those conversations.

1pvgkgb,t2 after major surgery - angry at myself and my body atm,"I had major surgery last Thursday and am mentally healthy enough to accept that this was/is going to affect my BG

I was diagnosed in September with a 9.4 A1C - I got it down to 5.2 with lifestyle change and Mounjaro so I could get this surgery.

On an average day my BG is around low to mid 80s on waking and 2 hours after a good meal its usually still under 100. I have a history of disordered eating and I, as a friend calls is, game my t2 by really knowing those numbers and holding them as a standard. If I go up to 115 I'm kicking my own butt and figuring out what caused that ""spike"". I put spike in quotes as my educator calls me on this every time I say something like spike for a 115 or 118 - I explain its a spike for me but yes I know that's my bad brain yapping at me

Since the surgery I'm still in the mid 100s and I'm embracing this is just the cost of getting a few organs carved out of me, exhaustion, and inability to exercise beyond slow walking and standing for 15 to 20 minutes

I establish this as yesterday my BG was 161 two hours after my meal. It was almost identical to other meals I've had that have not done this to me. A tuna steak that was about 4 oz and which I ate about 1/3 of because it was overcooked and I'd rather eat a sponge. Two mini potatoes mashed with butter - I ate half. 1/4 cup of corn - which I ate all. After a bit 3 gummy bears and 2 pieces of crystalized ginger. A meal which usually has me below 100. I did add a low carb/keto flatbread (1 c mozz, 1 T cream cheese, 1/4 c almond flour, an egg for 4 servings of which I had one) - but I'm not seeing how that could really hit me so hard.

I couldn't walk but I drank 3 glasses of water. And almost fell over when I saw that 161 on the meter

The only time I've seen a higher number was in the PACU after the surgery - I was 211 and they gave me two units of insulin

I guess I really just want to rant and moan - not sure there's much I can do about this. I haven't taken my Mounjaro again - holding off until Saturday so I can maintain a sensible routine - and maybe that will help a bit? I dunno. I suspect the balance of carb to protein didn't help and that is 100% on me. But, did I mention - eat a sponge?

Just. Very. Frustrated. And fighting extremely hard not to starve myself today to ""get myself under control"" - I KNOW that's super unhealthy. For the t2. I need protein to heal. But so very angry at myself

Update/Edit - my endo said I can suspend testing for a while as I’m eating a diet that has previously kept my BeatUs well-controlled. Better to eat and focus on enough protein for healing.

1pv1954,CGM Saved Me,"I'm not even a full year into having a CGM full time and it already saved me from a huge hyperglycemic event. The first curve is my breakfast, a modest spike in BS. Ignore the weird spike around 11 am, that was my shower spike, which always happens. After breakfast I went to a local gas station and got a big cup of zero sugar Pepsi around noon. At first I thought hmmm this kind of tastes weird but I went with it because surely the fountain would be correct. Well about an hour later I looked down at my watch and saw a BS reading of 155 at 1 pm! I was only 1/4 through the drink and stopped immediately, which is when my spike started coming back down. 

Later that day I went back to the gas station and told them my story. They assured me that there is no way they could have put regular soda in the wrong slot because it is a different size. I showed them my graph and said I have a CGM the numbers don't lie. They didn't seemed moved. I said please humor me and check. I'm diabetic and if someone else drinks this and its regular soda it could be really bad, especially if they dont have a continuous monitor. They come back from the back room and the lady was white. She said OMG someone put on regular cherry Pepsi instead of zero sugar. They immediately flushed all the lines to get it out.

The next morning I hit a local store for fresh produce (and something regional if I could find it). That set me up for stir fries, a simple stew, and hearty salads, all low to moderate glycemic load and easy to prepare.

I stayed at a hostel, and a few guests were curious about my meals. Those conversations felt great and made the trip even better. This would work for staying at an Airbnb or extended-stay hotel too.

I am on Metformin and Mounjarno, and lost 20lbs when I started taking the later. I started this year taking some antidepressants and other medications that caused me to gain those 20lbs back, however. 

I got serious about exercising at the beginning of this year and .. nothing happened. No mental happiness that I heard is supposed to happen, no workout high, no loss of fat or better fitting clothes, nothing. So I wallowed in self pitty for the past 2 months, but I haven't gained any weight so yay? But I am ready to get back to it! 

All this to say, how did any of you lose weight? My doctor basically told me that unless I eat less than 1300 calories it's impossible, but I barely eat as it is I feel! She also told me that any of the weight loss medications won't work on me since I am diabetic, which I am not really looking to lean on since I take enough medicine as it is.

I knows it scares him & it scares me too. i’m worried he’ll have a heart attack while he’s at work all alone. or it’ll just catch up to him because none of us really have the resources to help. I just want to know what the best course of action is? what are some things we can do. what should we be regularly checking? my dad hates having his blood sugar taken but i’m thinking about getting on him about being better about that. 

I just don’t know what to be checking for or how, what exactly he should be eating. he refuses to see a doctor regularly because we just can’t afford it sadly. i’d also love to hear some reassuring stories if possible, I feel kinda hopeless because I just love my dad so much.

1pt81xl,A1C down to 5.0!,"They might as well have tied streamers and balloons to me as I left my Dr’s office today: diagnosed T2 on 9/24/25 with A1C of 9.2, went in for my 3-month recheck and it’s down to 5.0! 

What worked:

\- Understanding that I don’t need to “count” carbs, but to balance my nutrition. Yes, I cut out sweets, bread, and high-carb snacks like cereal bars and fruit preserves, but I still eat carbs. I just balance everything with fiber and protein. Based on my last lipid panel, fats are okay, just limiting the saturated fats is a good goal. 

\-Ozempic. I’m almost up to the 2.0 dose, but I noticed gastric slowing even at .25.  That’s helped tremendously in my weight and nutrition management. 

\-Learning how my body reacts to carbs. Libre3 for all its recent issues was truly eye opening for what foods require a little extra planning. 

\- Exercise. Two walking miles a day, or 1hr strength training and 15-30 minutes on the treadmill. When I was sick, I still managed a slow 30 minutes on that treadmill, just to get my body moving a little. 

\-Sleep. I was waking up at 5am to walk every morning, and changed that to be flexible whenever I needed the extra time. I’d sometimes work out in the evening, and my sleep quality improved.

\- Seeing a therapist. Scheduling all the other Dr appointments I’d been putting off (lowers the anxiety about having failed to make those calls for so long). Lower stress = lower BG. 

\-Advocating for better medical guidance. I was one of the ones who got a diagnosis over the phone and medication Rx, and nothing else initially. I resolved to not be a victim of this thing, and scheduled a follow up with a different doctor (who specializes in diabetes).  THIS made all the difference. Your care team is crucial.

\- A supportive group of real in person humans. This was the luckiest thing for me, because not everyone has a supportive spouse, or a group of friends who either have well-controlled T2, or care for someone with well-controlled T2. 

Going forward: 

\-Going to try to bring my LDL down. It’s great for a non-diabetic, and mostly fine for me at 5.0, but I should keep aware. I eat a lot of cheese and meats these days, so it’s probably the next move. 

\-Keep active.

\-Get another CGM for the weeks when I need a little closer guidance due to less control over my diet.

If I can do this at 40 years old with a semi-sedentary career and a morbidly obese BMI to start? There’s hope for you too. ",1766430526.0,97,6,diabetes_t2,diabetes

1pt5av5,Reversing Type 2 Journey - Plateau CGM dat,"Since early February, I’ve been on a focused Type 2 diabetes reversal journey.

A few concrete data points so far:

	•	Weight ↓ \~43 lbs (235.9 → 193.2)

	•	Exercise: 6x/week (HIIT + daily walking)

	•	A1C: 7.1 → 6.7

What’s interesting (and honestly unexpected) is what I’m seeing now on CGM:

My average glucose is slightly higher, but the pattern is very different.

	•Before: lower average (\~129) but spiky, with big swings and overnight dips pulling the mean down

	•Now: higher average (\~139) but remarkably flat, with no major spikes or crashes

The last variable I changed:

	•Slightly increased protein intake over the past week

Below are two random nights - one is higher base but relatively flat and one lower average but more spikey.. 

So the question I’m exploring:

Has anyone else seen a phase where variability drops dramatically, but the mean temporarily rises  especially with higher protein and heavy training?

Most people see careful eating as saying no to foods they enjoy. But for me, it’s about saying yes to energy, recovery, and long-term health. It’s a choice, not a punishment. Restriction implies limitation; eating for nourishment feels empowering.

Changing my relationship with food has allowed me to stay in remission almost 2 years.

I ate several things, a peach, cookies, cheese, until I raised my glucose to 112 so I could go to sleep. This took me about two and a half hours of snacking, waiting 15 minutes, and repeating. Last night I didn’t inject 15 units because the night before the same thing had happened, so I only took 10. I have no way to contact my doctor because it’s the weekend and it’s a public hospital, so there’s no chance she would give me her number to reach her.

I’m assuming that it’s at least not as beneficial for blood glucose because you haven’t eaten the carbs YET, so they’re not available, but I wonder if I’m off base.  

I’m doing really well with diet and exercise, strength training has been absolutely a game-changer for my fasted glucose the morning after a resistance workout.

Last night I had a friend over to show her some of the work I’m doing, then we ordered fresh tacos and quesabirrias, but instead of corn tortillas, mine came in flour.  I wasn’t too concerned, because the protein and fat content made for an okay balance, but it was also later at night than I usually eat dinner.

My BG this morning was 85 - some of the lowest I’ve had, and usually what it is after an evening lifting session and an earlier, low carb dinner.

I had a 325ml I think it is, a half bottle, of red wine over the evening. My fasting blood glucose yesterday was 6.8mmol / 123 mg/dL, and this morning was 7.1mmol /128 mg/dL so not a massive spike, and I didn't sleep all that well so in the night I was expecting that to spike it too.

I got up and drank a protein drink and ate a Kind bar, which naturally didn't help (not enough sugar). I finally shut the phone off and went back to sleep. Yeah, not the smartest move in the world, but I felt fine. I did learn about so-called ""compression lows"" (i.e. the sensor will read artificially low glucose levels if you put too much pressure on it, such as rolling on top of it during the night).

1prrn6s,Diagnosed with diabetes but it just doesn't make sense.,"I (40F) just got diagnosed with diabetes. And a pretty severe case.  My numbers were astronomical. I went to the doctor and asked to be tested as I was incredibly thirsty all the time and I was like ""Google says this is diabetes..."" The thing is...I don't have any of the typical high risk lifestyle factors (poor diet, weight issues etc) or family history for diabetes. And other routine bloodwork I've had done over the last couple of years have never shown me even being close to prediabetic. My doctor was kind of confused by that as well and said ""sometimes it just randomly happens"". But like.... is that true?  Can you have zero warning of getting it and then... just have it show up with the numbers of someone who has had unmanaged diabetes for years? Ex: I had a salad for dinner the night after I saw my lab results (lettuce, egg, tomato, cucumber, homemade vinagrette) and I tested my blood sugar...22.4... He put me on metformin right away... but it just seems so weird. Are there other issues that could show up as diabetes and not actually be that? I'm confused and angry about this.

Update 1: Went out and just bought a cgm cause my Autistic ass doesn't want to wait until the 5th when I see my doc next to ask about getting one. Lol 😅 The libre 3. It didn't hurt at all (although the needle was too scary so I couldn't do it myself...lol) and it's quite a bit smaller than I expected. So yay! 

Update 2: I had 3 eggs with spinach and mushrooms around 6pm last night for dinner.  While sleeping,  my cgm says my blood sugar hit 21 around 2am. It's 7am now and my blood sugar is 17.1. I know it's only been a week... but shouldn't it be at least a little bit better by this point? I'm pretty scared to eat anything at all now for fear of it just getting worse.  😭

Update 3: So.. first of all..I'm a dummy. Everyone here kept asking about COVID or infections/ antibiotics etc.  And I just kept thinking...no, I don't have any infections etc.  BUT...it didn't even occur to me until a few days ago...I had shingles in late Feb....sooo...my bad for saying no. Cause I was just thinking of current vs months back. 🙃 But anyway... I've been doing zero carb,  zero sugar.  And my levels are sitting between 13-15. So...""better""?....lol But I feel like utter trash. I've lost another 8lbs in 2 weeks.  So almost 30lbs total in the last couple months since the symptoms got bad. My doctor today requested more labs and added the c-pep, GAD 65 and cortisol.  I did have to pay $65 for the GAD 65 because apparently it's not covered by OHIP. But it's a one time test,  so it's worth it to me to find out.  Whatever the results are... at least then I'll know. Because my Autistic ass can't just ""relax and wait and see"". I love that my doctor knows I'm being a bit crazy but still agrees to help calm it. He said in a nice way ""girl,  chill, we'll figure it out, I promise"" but he was happy to see I was taking it seriously to try and manage it. So maybe tomorrow I'll have results and finally know what the long term plan will look like. 🤷‍♀️

Update 4: alllllll the updates!  Lol Still waiting on the anti GAD (can take 12 businesses days). But my C-pep came back low.  0.269 nmol/l . All my other levels (A1C, ketones, glucose etc) were  just as bad as they were the first time, even while eating a low/no carb diet. Soooo....I am guessing that this combined with all the other factors of how quickly this appeared... it's likely type 1... but we'll need to wait for the Anti GAD to be absolutely sure I guess? 🤷‍♀️

Update 5: Final one...Anti GAD came back.  High. >250. Confirmation. I'm so glad I continued to push and didn't gaslight myself into thinking I'm just overreacting. I knew it didn't make sense.  Thank you everyone who gave advice and some great information for me to look into about diabetes in general.

Got my diagnosis via phonecall from my PCP, and almost zero guidance (just Ozempic and a 6-week follow up scheduled - no monitoring, no dietary guidance…zilcho).  Decided that I wasn’t going to be a victim, and made significant lifestyle changes that have stuck and are sustainable. Scheduled all the doctor appointments I’d been putting off (therapy, dietitian, mammogram, colonoscopy, sleep study). Started walking 2 miles every morning before work, and I try to put 7-9 miles in over the weekend, in two longer walks on my local rec path. Completely revamped my eating habits back to what it was when my husband and I were training to powerlift competitively (“slow carb,” but with a few adjustments for higher fiber whenever possible). I also advocated for a more in depth discussion with another doctor who specializes in diabetic care (same office as my overworked PCP), and she explained the science of my condition and prognosis with such great depth and care that I felt confident moving forward.

Im just wondering what your thoughts are on my current issue. Im seeing a kidney specialist, my primary care provider, and a urologist next month. Im also seeing a diabetes educator and my nephrologist in February as well. So I'll ask them these questions too. I was just curious what this amazing community has to think.

Here is my situation so far:

So, I found out i got type 2 diabetes in March of this year when I saw my primary care provider. I had a 6.6 A1C and weighed 320 pounds. The first month and a half, I didn't take my diagnosis seriously because my doctor said i needed two blood glucose results over 126 to be diabetic. So i was like, ""Whatever, I'll think about it later,"" but looking back now, i was diabetic but in March I didn't know.

So then i decided to take it seriously in May and I focused on drastically cutting my sugar until i saw my pcp again in July. He gave me Phentermine and Toperimate to try for a while. Unfortunately, although my diet changed, I only focused on cutting down on sugar and didn't think much about carbohydrates, which i know now was really stupid.  In addition to all of this, I started experiencing diabetic symptoms in the beginning of summer. I began becoming thirsty and peeing a lot, and i also began getting tired and had neuropathy too. However, with my diet change, the two weight loss pills, and some exercise, i lost 30 pounds when i saw him in July.

My A1C dropped to 5.8, and i was excited! This excitement led to me thinking i could be lax with my diet and i started eating sort of shitty until i saw my pcp again at the end of October. During this time (if I remember correctly), my thirst and peeing sort of got worse, and my neuropathy was still there. I also gained ten pounds as well. I was expecting a high A1C in October but my A1C dropped to 5.6. I was expecting to have an abnormal A1C since I was still drinking and peeing a lot. This really confused me, and that's when i decided to really take this seriously. I asked to be put on Metformin 500mg for this issue, which I later found out online that it doesnt fix your issues but helps with blood glucose and A1C.

So at the end of October I started changing my ways for the better. I started taking Metformin at the end of October and went on a relatively low-carb diet since then. I would say i stay under 120g of Carbs for 4 days a week and maybe more on a couple of other days a week. Through all of this, my peeing and drinking continued. I was getting really frustrated with the constant thirst and peeing, so I went back to my pcp and then he referred me to a nephrologist and to a urologist. He also checked my kidney functions, and I saw my eGFR, and it was a 76 at that time. I freaked me out because it's sort of low for my age. 

I also have to add that when I started Metformin, I felt a little off for a week and that sort of went away after 10 days, but recently, I started feeling off again. Like i have a mild headache and a very mild disorientation as well as fatigue in later parts of the day. I feel like this on most days i wake up as well as before and especially after I eat. I dont know why i feel like this even though ive been eating way better. I didnt have these new symptoms while I ate like crap.

● This could be because i lost quite a bit of weight. I was 300 pounds at the end of October and I was under 280 when i didnt feel so good. Now im 260 pounds as of this message.

●In addition to this weight loss ive been eating a much lower amount of carbs than before, so maybe thats why ive been feeling like crap.

● I've been getting less sleep so maybe thats why im not feeling the best.

These headaches/mild disorientation and fatigue are new symptoms but might not be because of my diabetes. What im really concerned about is my continuous thirst and urination. I went to an urgent care to get my blood work and I got some good results. My kidney functions increased pretty well. He said I didn't have kidney disease but told me to drink less water and eat more food. Ive been drinking a decent amount of water and he said that i should only drink like 130oz of water. He also said that high intake of water helped me raise my eGFR up to 104. He thinks im drinking too much water but I dont think i am.

What my post is trying to ask is this:

I dont know if i trust my blood glucose meter and A1C. I have been thirsty and peeing quite frequently while my numbers are in the acceptable range. I dont check my blood glucose too much (like one to three times a day) and my blood glucose has never been above like 135, (even after ive eaten) and not below 80 at my lowest point. The blood glucose meter instruction sheet tolld me that uric acid can affect my blood glucose and that kidney disease can affect my A1C or blood glucose. Since my kidneys look mostly well after my urgent care visit, then it could be an uric acid issue, but I have no idea. The urgent care did not check my A1C or uric acid, so I'll check that in January.

Thanks for reading this long ass message! What do you guys think? Do you think my A1C and glucose readings could be wrong. Im honestly doubting my readings since March. I ate like absolute dog shit before my diagnosis, but I only had a 6.6 A1C? Also, I didn't eat as I should and had a drop of A1C between July and October? Not to mention ive never had a single bad home blood glucose reading, im so confused!

I also would like to add that my foot neuropathy was mild but sort of concentrated for a few minutes a day when I was lax with my diet between July and October but now, in the last 2 weeks, my neuropathy hasn't been as painful but ive been experiencing it throughout the day instead of a few moments.

TLDR: im still thirsty and peeing quite a bit, but my A1C or blood glucose numbers aren't in the bad range. What's going on?",1766182192.0,0,12,diabetes_t2,diabetes

Give you some background and then open it up to advice and experiences of people out there. Appreciation for all responses in advance. 

3 months ago, a guy dropped a washing machine on my foot. I broke 3 toes on one foot. I supported and taped up the toes, took a few days staying off them and then got back to work building our forever home out of a 100+ yr old cabin we have spent the last 3 years restoring, updating & saving. Over the next week I noticed my great toe on my other foot had a huge black spot on the pad. No real pain or discomfort, but freaked me out. Ended up being a blessing in disguise. I went to the doc and they ran my A1c. Was 11.7. Put me on Metform + pioglit. Also spent a month going to the wound center for the toe & getting special shoes/inserts made. I made extreme change to my diet (removal of all added sugars, lowering carbs and increasing fiber in diet). @ 3 month checkup yesterday, A1c was 6.7 without fasting (they forgot to tell me to not eat for at least 4 hrs prior, so I was about 3hrs out from breakfast). My only real issue over the 3 months was having diarrhea and continually very loose stools. Doc decided to prescribe the pioglitazone-glimepiride once a day vs Metformin combo twice a day. Reading up on the glimepride, I worry about it's tendency to cause BS to bottom out and am looking to see if anyone out there has experience with the drug combo and, maybe has made this switch or other useful experiences with both drugs. 

Other quick info of potential importance. I am 6'1"", late 50s, and am currently just under 200lbs. I am relatively active (you don't build a house solo without being) and walk a very active ACD dog multiple miles a day. 3 yrs ago I was over 250lbs. All the wait was lost prior to the diagnosis. Prior diet was horrible and lazy - sugary drinks, ice cream and overly processed foods.

1pqv1ut,hormonal fluctuations increasing blood sugar (just venting),"This feels very silly, but my fasting and evening/pre-bedtime blood sugars have gone up about 10-15 points this past week, and it's made me incredibly sad and upset. 

My usual range for my blood sugars in the morning has been about 83-103 and now I'm in the 95-115 range, and my evening blood sugars are slightly higher. I'm on my period and I've had a lot of stress this past week, plus poor sleep. I had one day where I went out to celebrate graduating (finished my master's degree) and had a piece of cake - which I've had before, a few weeks ago (right after my last period) and it was fine! Otherwise, my diet hasn't changed (high protein, high fiber, low carb, and I'm in a calorie deficit) and I'm exercising more than I had been in the past.

My A1c is down to 5.8% from 9.3% in September. My doctor and I have been discussing changes to my meds to simplify my routine, and I was so excited. Seeing the progress with all the changes I've been making has been so rewarding and I felt so accomplished. And then these numbers started showing up and it feels like everything I've done is just unraveling before me. I know that these these numbers aren't a huge deal and they're mostly in the range my endo set for me, but it's just so discouraging. And they aren't going down no matter what I do.  I'm pretty sure it's just hormones and the stress impacting blood sugar, but I just want to cry (which is also the hormones, probably). 

In case it's relevant - I'm on 10mg Mounjaro 1x/week, 1000mg Metformin 2x/day, and 12 units of lantus 1x/day. It's so much meds, and I don't mind that, but I'd like it to be more streamlined.

A couple years ago I drastically changed my diet and lifestyle and my A1C dropped 4% in 3 months but all my changes weren’t sustainable long term so it went back up again. 

I’m doing it slow this time. Small micro habits that build over a long time rather than “fixing” everything all at once. First I started with getting rid of sugary drinks (all I drink is water and tea now with an occasional Poppi). My next step is to add yoga 2x a week and swimming 1x a week and do that for 3 weeks before I move on to the next step which is focusing on cooking (I can’t cook for the life of me so I’m starting out with the things I can do). 

I told my endocrinologist I’m giving myself 6 months (until June) to slowly introduce all these habits so I stay with them. Had to unfortunately stop taking my anti depressants and antipsychotic as those were contributing to high A1C and triglycerides.

1ppgnze,Aw man.... this sucks,"Hi, 23f here.

Want to start off by saying diabetes isn't new to me, but it's the manifestation of a long life of neglect and poor mental health. 

Around 9-12 I was really chubby and my grandmother would point it out often to a degree that made me very depressed. There's never been a day she hasn't mentioned my weight, but I know it's because she was worried about it so I don't hold it against her anymore. The doctor also pointed out that I might be depressed but she's the silent generation so she just thought I needed to be busier. 

13-16 the doctor kept saying I was pre-diabetic and I got diagnosed with PCOS; however I never had any cysts, my period was regular, no excess hair, I was just overweight. I stress eat because times were very difficult for me up to Covid.

When Covid hit, I was the most depressed I'd ever been. No showering, 110% sugar and junk food, sat all day on the computer, I'd snap at anyone and cry every night, I was a mess! A lot of family death happened around this time as well. It subsided a bit but my mental health was terrible up to the point when I moved into an apartment on my own (late 2024). I was doing fine, but the loneliness crept in and I had a lot of sepuku ideation. It was the second time where I felt like my depression was at it's worse. My max weight was 410 lbs. I was taking medication and got diagnosed with severe Bipolar disorder/generalized anxiety. They had a grip on my life until recently.

June 2025 was the end of my episode and I've been having recurring yeast infections and BV ever since. I've also had a few boil every other month and thought it was a staph infection (didn't function like HS), since I pluck my hairs a lot and might've been spreading the yeast bacteria around. Two weeks ago I asked for a PCR test and found I had ureaplasma and c. glabrata yeast (no bV). Then I went to the primary and showed him my test results from October 2025 which I hadn't looked at (I was visiting family and in a rush at the time) my A1C was 15.5! I'm taking bloodwork in two days to see what it is now but my doctor started me on insulin (latus 15 units) and I just feel so defeated. 

It's my fault for not changing my habits, but I also hadn't been able to deal my depression effectively (dysfunctional household). I'm now 330 lbs but my doctor thinks it's atrophy from the uncontrolled diabetes. I thought I was doing so well with my weightloss too.... I just don't know what to do? I'm trying to be optimistic as my primary said the insulin is temporary until I see an endo (in late January). 

I'm not going to have insurance after this month. Latus with goodrx won't break my bank but the doctor's visits might. I've been trying to keep it together but I feel like I'm falling apart a little and I can't go into another depression or else who knows what could happen.

Seeing a therapist next week with the last of my insurance for some peace of mind. Started going to the gym today (SUPER sedentary life previously as I wfh) and I want to make the necessary lifestyle change. I've already modified my diet a few months prior; now I'm including non inflammatory foods. 

Any tips on how to stay calm are much appreciated!

1pop72j,From a 10.4% A1c to 5.7%," 


Last August, my annual physical and lab results served as a massive wake-up call for a background i am 32F.  I was diagnosed with T2D, CKD and primary hypertension. The numbers were alarming: high cholesterol, high uric acid, elevated triglycerides, high LDL, and elevated SGPT. My resting heart rate was consistently high, but the biggest shocks were my Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) at 215 mg/dl and an A1c of 10.4%. 

My doctor strongly advised insulin, but I wasn't ready for that step. I asked if we could try oral medication first. I was prescribed Metformin ER (1000mg) and two other medications for diabetes, along with two additional prescriptions for my cholesterol and uric acid levels.

Determined to change, I thankfully found this 'lil community for research and support. Seeing everyone’s ""small wins"" gave me the hope I needed to believe that I could do it too. I committed to a proper diet, daily exercise, and a goal of 10k
 steps every day. By September, I was diligent—I took every pill, hit every step goal, and the weight began to fall off rapidly.

However, the journey wasn't a straight line. During October and November, my motivation wavered. I felt like my progress had plateaued. I started having ""cheat days"" almost every week, my exercise routine declined, and I even stopped taking most of my medications, relying only on Metformin for nearly two months. It wasn't until December that I found my focus again and resumed my full medical regimen.

On Dec 13th, I went in for my follow-up labs, paralyzed with nerves. When the results came back, I let out a massive sigh of relief. Every single ""high"" marker had returned to the normal range. The only remaining hurdle is my UACR, but my A1c is now down to 5.7%. I have a appointment to my doctor later hopefully im off with some of my meds. 

but I still can’t help but wonder: if I had stayed 100% disciplined without the cheat days or the missed meds, would the results be even better? Perhaps. But I am choosing to celebrate this win. I am incredibly grateful to this community for the information and the constant push to keep going.

1pojy0d,Januvia and coupons.,"So recently got prescribed Januvia. Was on metformin and Jardiance and was still struggling to get a1c lowered. 

So asked my doc to send a rx for 90 day supply bc 90 day usually is significantly cheaper. Well Januvia was still a bit pricey. With insurance a 30 day supply was $60 and 90 day was $120. I know it could be worse bc without insurance it was like $2700 lol. 

So I decided to look online for coupons and test my luck. Got a coupon right from the Januvia website to test out at Walgreens to see if it would stack with my insurance. It did!!! 

My grand total with the coupon for a 90 day supply came out to…… $5!!!!! And I can use the coupon every 30 days. Walgreens gave me the coupon back.

1po8k0b,Diabetes and Celiac Disease,"Feeling a bit overwhelmed. Long story short while i have had very good control of my overall blood sugars (5.5 A1c) i still struggle with blood sugar spikes with subsequent BG crashes (some severe <40 mg/dl). Went to a new University Endo to try and figure out what is going on. Reactive Hypoglycemia came up. Had a battery of tests done and shows no signs of insulinoma or other concerning markers, She suggested doing a trial of Victoza to see if it would help stabilize my blood sugar roller coaster rides and sent me to a University Nutritionist for dietary guidance.

After talking with the nutritionist about my current foods that i eat and past foods or diet tries and GI issues she strongly suspects Celiac or at least some sort of gluten intolerance. At one point i was tested for it but at the time i was already eating pretty much gluten free (meat and green beans and eggs was my staple). She did mention that the test that was done by Gastro maybe inaccurate because of not being gluten challenged  at the time.

She did send my PCP a note to get me retested (not sure what that would entail). We did make some dietary changes to the suggested typical Reactive Hypo diets (be surprised what it all entails and includes whole wheat products) She also has concerns about going low or no carb again as it did not work out well for me. I also lead a very active lifestyle. 

In one sense i hope the testing comes out positive just so can can get some closure and some help and avoid one more med that i don't want to take or go thru a 72 hour Hospital monitored fasting test.

1po0rvs,The importance of Sleep and Glucose Control,"During good sleep (especially deep sleep):

Insulin sensitivity improves

Liver glucose output drops

Stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline) fall



When sleep is short or fragmented:

Fasting  glucose  rises

Post-meal spikes are higher

The body acts more insulin-resistant even with good food

  
I use to believe that length of sleep was the only thing that mattered.  It only part of the puzzle.   How much deep sleep, light sleep, rem sleep, awake time gives a complete picture of how well   I do with sleep.  If you have resources getting a device to analyze your sleeping patterns can be a great tool for glucose control.  Talk to your medical team and see if sleep analysis is something you should consider.

Diagnosed about a year ago - have kept things more or less under control with Metformin, and I've been wearing a CGM for about 6 months to try and help identify things that do and don't spike me, which I think I've done a pretty good job with.

I'll admit I have a bit of a sweet tooth - I was looking at some of the protein cereals out there as something to have a quick 1/2 cup or cup of as a snack sitting at my desk. I looked at both Magic Spoon and Cravies cereals. Cravies had deal going, so I ordered a couple of boxes.

I had about a cup of it this morning, and my post meal spike was one of the highest I've ever seen (over 225 - I know that's not THAT high but it's high for me.)  I went back through the ingredient list, and I can't for the life of me identify what could have trigged it. The brown rice protein? Cassava flour?

It's crazy that last night I made Alfredo with wheat pasta and Italian sausage, and I barely saw a blip (yes, there was more fat and protein.) I guess like the rest of you, I'm still trying to figure all this out.

My A1C was 6.7 in June, and I'm now down to 6.1. Which is great, as I did that with hard work using a cgm, serious diet changes, and strong will power. But thanks to that decrease, the insurance company refuses to cover CGMs for me (I know, common complaint). I am in the same position as many: I can't afford to buy my own CGMs on a regular basis, and I know that without that kind of input I risk drifting back up into the T2 range again. So frustrating. 

I discussed this with my super-supportive husband and came up with a game plan: I have some idea of which foods I should be and can be eating.

I’m struggling with a lot of anxiety and guilt right now. Before getting pregnant, I took my metformin daily and went to my yearly review appointment, but I never checked my blood sugars regularly or made any major changes to my diet.

Now that I’m pregnant, I’m starting to monitor my blood sugars and actually seeing how my diet affects it, and it’s really stressful. I feel guilty because I worry that I may have hurt my baby because I got pregnant unplanned. For example, my fasting glucose is currently 5.6, and my 1 hour post-meal readings tend to be anywhere between 5-8. I can’t shake the feeling that I’ve set my baby up for problems because realistically, this might be the case. I feel anxious and very alone in this.

Sept. 10th my A1C was 7.88 so at the end of the month my doctor weaned me off insulin and now I'm only on metformin (750mg twice a day).

Oct. 10th I ended up in the hospital AGAIN with another episode of diverticulitis but my A1C was down to 5.89, so something good. 

Tuesday I have a follow up appointment with my diabetes team and I got my A1C tested again.

1pli3y0,T2 and Losing a Lot of Weight,"For those who need to lose a lot of weight and got a T2 diagnosis, do it! I know it’s not easy, but in my case (and maybe for you) it could be a game changer. This might be a humble brag and maybe it is, but I’ve worked hard at getting here and the stories I read and watched helped me tremendously get to where I am now. 

So in 2024 I finally got serious about losing weight and that’s when I found out I went from pre-diabetic at 6.3 to the land of diabetes to a 6.9 A1C. This was the holiday season 2023 from Halloween to New Years where I pretty much gave up on losing weight and put on an eating clinic (non-stop) of the worst foods you can imagine. I embarrassingly was pushing 450. It was either get control or just let it ride to an early grave. I have regular blood tests and doc visits so I know I was in that range for only a few months or so. I think that might be important. 

I wanted to do this without meds to see if I could and my doc said go for it. So with my WW app and my BGM I started to learn what I could and could not eat. My fear of a high number on that meter outweighed any food I might desire. My A1C dropped to the mid-to-upper fives in a couple of months and then to lower fives where I sit now. The pounds melted away and my numbers steadily dropped. I never had crazy high numbers, at least that I know of, because I wouldn’t eat anything that I thought would spike me badly. I did intermittent fasting or time restrictive eating (learned that from Beat Diabetes on YouTube) with no more than 50 carbs a day to rest my pancreas. After a while I noticed my overnight numbers at 100 or below more often than not and my dawn phenomenon got better as well. Initially I would see a quick rise to 130 or even 140 in the morning. Now, I may see a 120 for a few minutes and then like clockwork I drop to baseline or below by 9:30. Occasionally DP doesn’t even show up. Not sure what the secret sauce for that to happen is at the moment. I spend most of the day in the 90s and 80’s and sometimes in the 70s by dinner time. Of course it depends on what I’m eating, or not eating, during the day to get those numbers to stay that low.

For the first time I’ve been really testing my numbers. I’ve been noticing remarkably normal glucose rises during and after the meals I’ve been eating.  For Thanksgiving I had mashed potatoes and stuffing in reasonable portions. I ate more snacks than I should and had a tiny bit of eggnog. While my numbers have been great with wise food choices, I was expecting the worst with my meal. I barely hit 120 for a short time and was down to baseline within two hours. The next day I said screw it and wanted to see what a cup of Hood Eggnog (its crack to me) would do. I was sitting at 98 and had a rise to 110-115 or so for a very short amount of time. This surprised me quite a bit. Yesterday I did a test with some sugar free instant oatmeal. By all accounts a “normal” reaction glucose-wise. I may do one more test in the coming days and then lay off the testing. 

My goal, even if magically there was a real cure, is keep eating in the way I do now. It’s made me healthier than I’ve ever been so this is a lifestyle that ain’t changing for me. I’m back to reality and low carb choices, but it was interesting to see what I could get away with and not spike. I think losing weight and a lot of visceral fat has been the biggest game changer. Today I’m down to 255 and still losing to get to my goal. My A1C sits in the low-to-mid 5s and my overnight numbers are generally in the low-to-mid 90s. Once in a while a tiny bit over depending how late and what I ate the night before. 

Before I get the this is progressive and it’s not cured and you’ll eventually be in a miserable place with your diabetes, I’m not preaching this is a cure. I understand that everyone is different and a lot of people are suffering to get their situation under control. Doing the things I did to get to this place again will lead me back and to a world of hurt, but…

What I am saying is there may be more control in your hands than you realize and I hope this gives someone who’s been struggling with weight that sometimes you can find a path that might not lead you to those miserable outcomes. ",1765620775.0,19,16,diabetes_t2,diabetes
1plcpng,Advice: Am I overreacting? How do I talk to my dad about his health?,"Hi, as a family member of someone with Type 2 diabetes, I'm looking for some advice, and hope this is the right place to post this.

My dad was diagnosed with T2 in his late 20s and is now in his late 50s. He has always managed his meds and diet himself with little to no issues, but lately he has been having more and more frequent low blood sugar episodes. He will wake up in the middle of the night or early morning with dangerously low blood sugar, and while he keeps snacks/juice by his bed for these cases, there's been a couple of time where he has fallen/gotten hurt as a result.

Recently this has been happening more and more often, and the other day his sugar was so low that my stepmom couldn't wake him up, and he was rushed to the hospital with a low blood sugar level of 37. They were both traveling when this happened, so I only heard about this over the phone and haven't gotten to see him yet (he's flying in tonight). It was a devastating phone call to get and I hate to think of how scared he must have felt and how traumatizing the situation must have been for both of them. I'm so grateful that the doctors were able to revive him and that he is coming home safe.

My dad has always been very protective of me, and doesn't like to talk about his health as he doesn't want me to worry. I'm 27 and live two hours away from him now, and only heard about this days later when my stepmom convinced him that he had to tell me what had happened. I, ofcourse, want to know what's going on with his health and help him manage it however I can. I'm considering moving back home to live with him because my stepmom travels often and is terrified this will happen again when she isn't home. Are we overreacting? 

I'm ashamed to admit that I don't think I know enough about my dad's condition. He has always handled his medication and health well, and has always been a little cagey about it, especially when I was younger, so I've never done the research to really try to understand what he goes through. I've always been under the impression that while this is a serious condition, it can be managed with the right meds, diet, and exercise, and that he could live a long and healthy life.

Now I'm just so worried about him, and full of questions. I'll ofcourse do my research, and will try to come to his doctor with him and be more involved going forward, but I was hoping for some advice on how to talk to him about all of this. I don't want to be overbearing or infantilizing, but I feel so helpless not being involved in his care at all. Am I overreacting to this situation? Is it more common than I realize to have low blood sugar episodes? If you have any resources or books about type 2 diabetes that you would recommend, I would also really appreciate that.

Thanks for reading, and thank you in advance for any and all advice or insight.",1765600549.0,3,8,diabetes_t2,diabetes
1plb892,Lesson learned from a newbie:,"Things I’ve learned from trial and (fairly large) error so far in week 1 that I wish someone had told me: 

-Keep your long-acting and rapid-acting insulin pens in entirely different parts of the refrigerator (and also maybe on time locks or something like they have in the back at the liquor store to prevent robberies) so you don’t accidentally give yourself 28 units of lispro while you’re making your coffee. Ask me how I know 🙄. If you do, just start drinking Pepsi on the way to the ER (obvs I’m not a doctor, I just play one on tv, so you do you on the Pepsi) 

- keep a little bag in your car with soda, snacks, whatever gets your numbers up, plus a good book, a charger cable and block, and anything else you think you might like to have in the ER while you get your shit together 

- insulin pens need to be kept in a cool place. Lunch box with a freezer pack or similar. I just got a super cute leopard print one but the possibilities are endless. Retail therapy is real. Write your scale down on an index card to throw it in that bag to reduce bulk. Also: they make miniature sharps containers, so cute 🐥. 

- a CGM has about a 10-minute lag time and has been anywhere from 5 to 30 points off my blood sugar reading as compared to actually poking my finger. so make sure you’re doing the finger stick to get super accurate readings before you measure out your mealtime dose. The cgm has, so far, been a good way for me to track whether I’m going up or down or stabilizing, but I’m not relying on it for accurate numbers to determine my lispro dosage. My hyper fixation this week has been watching the ekg-esque readout…it’s very dramatic 😂

1pkth4s,Just diagnosed and at a bit of a loss of where to now.,"Hi all. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes today after tests both yesterday and today.

My cholesterol is high - Total cholesterol 226mg/dl
My glucose is high - fasting level 303mg/dl and HbA1C at 13.6%

I am disappointed in myself for my extremely bad diet, I know my mum would be looking down at me saying 'I told you to stop drinking the sugar drinks and eating the junk food' and it's exactly what my wife said too.

I'm also very disappointed in my doctor back in Australia. I showed the doctor today lab results from 2022, and he said the results clearly show a trend to high glucose and cholesterol and the doctor should have taken action 3 YEARS AGO!

I saw a nutritionist today to set out a eating plan, basically 6tbl spoons carbs, 2portion protein and 3portion veggies a meal. The nutritionist wasn't very helpful though in terms of giving me ideas on what to cook. She said like have rice, Tempe, chicken and veggies. But nothing about what marinades or spices I can use to actually add some flavour.

Does anyone have any good recipes websites out there that give great recipes that sort of follow the 6/2/3? Bonus points if the website caters for different regions as I'm SEA based at the moment, so somethings are impossible to get here.

I tried chatGPT for ideas, seemed to want me to eat 6 eggs a day, and suggested foods the nutritionist said to avoid... So I think it was good for an idea of what to do, but not reliable at all.

Also, does anyone recommend an app to track maybe food (with pictures taken) intake, water intake, medicine intake, feelings ECT. 

I have to say, first day in years without sugar drinks and damn, my headache! For others who had a sugar drink addiction, how long did the headaches last? And any useful advice to break the addiction (apart from the fact of I don't, my 6yr old might not have a dad much longer).

I have a check in a month with both my doctor and nutritionist to see how it's going and if the medication is working. My goals are to reduce my levels in the month and lose 3kg.

Sorry, I'm rambling a bit. So much going through my head atm. Any tips, tricks and advice is greatly appreciated.",1765550278.0,4,25,diabetes_t2,diabetes
1pkmmqx,Diagnosed T2 and taking Metformin. Peeing all the time.,"Hi all 

I was diagnosed type 2 diabetic approx 3 months ago and am taking Metformin. Also have high cholesterol and blood pressure and taking medication for both of those as well.

Pre-diagnoses, I had the typical symptoms including frequent urination. I was under the impression that now I am taking medication and eating the right things etc that the frequent urination would ease up. However, it's gotten worse. Example would be I go to the toilet before bed at night and then get up at least 2 more times in the next 30 minutes to go again and it's quite a lot of urine each time. It's not just at night, it's all throughout the day, large amounts of urine maybe on average once an hour. 

I used to drink *a lot* of iced coffee (here in Australia there's a popular one you can get in a two litre bottle) but it's 'healthy' (sarcastic) - made with 99.5% fat free milk, no added sugar. So it could be worse. However, I only have that every now and then, I drink water all day but I drank water all day before my diagnosis also and never had this problem with the urination.

I told my doctor about it and he's a bit stumped. I'm due my 3 monthly bloods soon so he will keep an eye on things there. 

I'm just really confused about all the peeing. It's now got to the point that it's really annoying.

Is this something that just now comes with the territory? Or has someone has this before and it turned out to be another issue entirely?

1pkkjp0,Behold the Power of Activity,"I have a moderate carb diet and tonight I had dinner at 7:45 with about 85g of carbs. Shortly after, I took a 15-minute walk, then a little later hopped on the bike trainer for 45 minutes. My CGM showed a peak of 115 and even dipped to 55 during the ride, though a fingerstick showed I was actually about 75 which is where it leveled off after I finished. Just another reminder that CGM lows during exercise can be misleading.

My usual point stands: *carbs aren’t the enemy*. The issue for diabetes is how well our body handles glucose. With the right mix of diet, activity, and sleep/stress management, we support our meds and improve our control.

Activity shouldn't be an afterthought: it's a powerful tool in our toolbelt!

To be frank, this diagnosis is both a wake-up call but also a bit overwhelming. I know that I have not been treating my body well (sedentary, high stress job w/ a complete lack of work/life balance) and so I am not surprised that this is the result. But now I am trying to figure out what comes next.

1pjyrqm,"I’ve been around, but never told my story. For anyone struggling hope this helps.","I, male, was diagnosed with diabetes type 2 about 10 months ago when I was 29. A1C of 9.7, 6ft in height, and weight being 345. Diabetes is not a new thing in my family, both families have diabetes and my mom is diabetic. The Dr said it was mostly genetic, however my weight and the amount of sweets I was eating would say otherwise. Right away I was put on metformin and 2 other meds one for cholesterol and one for my liver I believe. They offered me insulin, but I begged the Dr to let me try and manage this by myself. She told me that I had 3 months to see how I do and to see if I need insulin or not.

Right away, the self hatred came in. I actually found out my results while sitting outside of work in the rain. I began to cry, I was so angry with myself my diet and my choices. I felt absolutely horrible. I told my wife and my mom, I think my mom who is diabetic took it extremely poorly. I promised my wife and my mom that I would get over this. Everyone around me including myself acted like this was a death sentence.

The only thing on my mind at this point was, I got myself to this I will get myself out. But right away came very unhealthy decisions. I basically swung the other way, got rid of all the food in my home, I gave a ton away to my family. I began to exercise (in an unhealthy way I did a lot of damage to my body at first), the foods I loved were gone (I no longer went out to get food with my wife, I declined to eat any of my moms food since culturally we have a lot of carbs), I believed that everyone else who was not doing what I was doing was wrong and did not care about improving their situation. My weight dropped daily, first 5lbs, then 10lbs. I lost 50lbs the first month I was doing this. My body was weak and I was tired, but I said that this feeling was appropriate for someone who got themselves into this situation.

This only led to me being more upset when I didn’t lose weight, I was weighing myself daily, would be extremely upset when I stagnate (starve myself more). I stopped eating what I wanted, but when I would have a little I would feel horrible about myself and what I’ve been doing. I felt ashamed, I began to tell people I’m not fun anymore and that people can’t have fun around me because I can’t have food.

Around 275, I got stuck for weeks. I didn’t know what I was doing wrong. Turns out I starved myself, to the point that my metabolism slowed down. I had basically gone from eating 3 meals a day, to eating 1 actual meal. I was not getting the nutrition that my body needed. I began to feel as if why should I try if what I’m doing is not decreasing my numbers or weight.

I did not want to learn about diabetes or what a healthy life could be. I thought that I could get over this doing what I’m doing and nothing else. More importantly I was diabetic, but I didn’t know what that meant. It didn’t help that when I was diagnosed my doctor just went “here lose weight don’t have sugar, come back in 3 months.”

During my 3 month visit my dr congratulated me, but I asked to meet with a dietitian. I met with them we talked about my diet, I began to speak with people at work who had diabetes, and I spoke with a friend of mine who has T1. I opened up to my wife about my feelings, she told me that she was concerned that I was losing weight so quickly. I took it to heart , I began to explore read different articles, my wife began to make different foods for us and made diabetic friendly meals. I looked for replacement foods, sugar free low carb replacements, I began to eat 2 meals a day (I combine breakfast and lunch due to work schedules), most importantly (though I do still weigh myself daily) I began to fall in love with my body and myself. I went to the big E ate horribly for a day, but then came home and realized that my numbers and my weight weren’t going to mean that my life and all my work was for nothing. My numbers were up, my weight went up, but this was only a bump in the road now. A couple weeks ago was my birthday and I had cake with my family. This was the first time that I ate my mom’s cooking after 5 months and she cried. In my culture food is extremely important, and saying no to a mother’s cooking is an insult. I realized that what I’m trying to do is not a sprint, it is now my life it’s how many people live.

What I did at first was not sustainable and all it did was drive me deeper into a miserable hole, I know some people need to avoid certain foods entirely, but going the way I did things was only a disaster for me.

I’ve made many changes, currently I am low carb, exercising semi daily, I try to avoid sugar like the plague during the week only (weekends and special occasions I allow myself to have some sugar). But currently 215lbs, A1C was 5.9, some metformin dose was recently reduced a bit which is a win! I count macros the best I can, I am not an expert and much of the time I let my wife do the choosing. The amount of eating out has gone down a ton, specially with this economy, but when my wife feels like going out we do.

Many people cannot do what I did. I have a wife who is not diabetic but changed her whole live for me too, I have a job that pays well enough that I don’t need a second job. I don’t have kids to feed so I don’t have to worry about making crazy changes. I also don’t need insulin at this time. I have insurance which helps with my meds, some peoples insurance is way worse than mine.

My goal started out by wanting to not be diabetic and loose the meds. I know now that I will be diabetic my whole life, but that I can decrease or get rid of my meds entirely. My goal now is to live a healthy life, I’ve been overweight my whole life and I am currently finding out that I can do things now that I didn’t know I could do. I’m trying these things, wanting to see what I missed out for so long. I still want to loose some weight.

I am the healthiest I have ever been, I weigh at this moment what I weighed when I was 13 years old. My dad hasn’t picked me up in years and the other day he lifted me up to crack my back.

It might be silly but a huge goal of mine is to ride a bike, something I have been able to do since I was in 7th grade! I’m hoping to do this next summer.

I don’t know if this will last, obviously I could go back to eating unhealthy or gain weight starting tomorrow. But as of right now, I am happy with my weight and with myself, and I’ll enjoy that for now.",1765463061.0,41,24,diabetes_t2,diabetes

OP:

I just scheduled a colonoscopy for January.  One of the questions they asked while setting it up was “are you diabetic?”

I started out saying “I’m PRE-diabetic” but then just said…yes, I am diabetic.

I’ve been “PRE” diabetic for almost a decade.

Should I just accept my fate, and quit pretending I can reverse it?  Just say “I’m diabetic” without adding the “PRE” bit?

I have eating disorder issues…no matter how hard I try to eat right, I’ll inevitably F up, again and again.  Chances of me actually reversing this with diet & exercise are extremely low.  (But I did get a “perfect month” on my exercise watch for November!)

1pjdnul,"Newly diagnosed, confused about type & doctor’s advice — need input","Hi everyone,  
I’m a 30M from Canada, diagnosed with diabetes at the end of August with an HbA1c of 12.7.  

- I immediately changed my lifestyle: quit smoking, started strength training + daily walks.  
- My doctor first prescribed Metformin 500 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, then switched me to Sitagliptin/Metformin 50/1000 (1 tab for a week, then twice daily).  
- After 1 month, my HbA1c dropped to 9.8 and my CGM showed glucose never above 8 mmol/L.  

When I asked what type of diabetes I have, my doctor said “since you respond to meds, you’re type 2.”  

Weight changes:  
- At diagnosis: 69 kg (height 5’6.5”)  
- After 1.5 months: 65 kg (unintentional loss)  
- Now (3 months later): 63 kg  

My dietitian reviewed my CGM data and calorie logs, noticed I was having lows, and advised me to stick with 1 tab daily instead of 2. She also suggested I ask my doctor to reconsider the diagnosis, since my lean body type, weight loss, and age might point toward LADA (type 1.5).  

Latest results:  
- HbA1c: 6.0 (after 3 months)  
- Blood work: all normal, triglycerides improved  
- Ultrasound: showed signs of fatty liver (doctor told me to “avoid all fats,” even though I mostly eat balanced and only added nuts/avocados recently).  

Concerns:  
- My doctor insists I’m type 2 and says “when you’re older and meds stop working, you’ll become type 1.”  
- He wrote “extremely high BP” on my ultrasound referral, but my BP has always been normal (I even showed logs to the technician).  
- He prescribed the ultrasound mainly because I kept asking him about the type of diabetes and my unexplained weight loss.  
- I know there’s a 90% chance I’m type 2 since both my parents are, but I don’t want to risk even a 10% chance of a wrong diagnosis.  
- I feel like my progress (A1c drop, lifestyle changes) is mostly self-driven, and my doctor isn’t considering current research or nuances like LADA.  

Question:  
Is it just me, or does this sound like my doctor isn’t very knowledgeable about diabetes management? Should I look for a new family doctor who’s more up-to-date on diabetes care?

1pik7yw,Please kick my ass real quick about getting back to eating well,"Hey all! 27 year old woman with PCOS here. I was diagnosed at 19.




I’ve been really good at managing things for quite a while, but unfortunately, in September I developed acute pancreatitis after a year of being on the yellow brick road. The treatment for that comes down to pain management, not eating for 2ish weeks, and then slowly incorporating foods again- VERY low fat, low fibre, and high carb. Not ideal obviously, but pancreatitis is kind of a big deal, so it takes precedence over diabetes management.




2 and a half months later, I’m pretty much back to normal. All the pain is gone and I can eat my normal diet again. The whole event has me slipping off the train, though. 




There was this glorious 2 week period where I was lowering my carb intake and raising my fat intake, and I just… got to eat like a normal person. I got to have normal sandwiches, I got to have pasta, I had toast in the morning with my eggs… it was awesome.



Now, though, it’s getting hard to kick my ass back into gear. I got used to the carbs again. Added in is the fact that I went back to school and it’s exam season, and after a quite frankly horrific semester, I am stressed out of my mind and do NOT want to cook healthy food. I’m so tired, and the thought of going back to diabetes management is really punching my mental health right now.

1pi8ape,"Suggestions for a high protein, portable breakfast","I was diagnosed earlier this year and my go-to breakfast has been a high protein smoothie (greek yogurt, protein powder, frozen fruit). I have a CGM, and this always kept my glucose in range without too high a spike.

I don't like to eat when I first get up, so I typically bring breakfast to work and eat it slowly at my desk. It's gotten too cold for smoothies, so I switched to overnight oats. Basically the same as my smoothie minus protein powder and adding rolled oats and chia seeds. But I'm finding this really spikes my blood sugar (yesterday I spiked to \~250 and didn't come down for a while - even with a 15 minute walk).

I thought maybe eating some protein first would temper things, so today I ate a cheesestick before the oatmeal (I made a big batch for the whole week on Saturday). I'm already at 202 and rising.

Dinner last night was chicken tetrazzini over rice . Breakfast was a hard boiled egg, two sausage links (I don't eat pork), a slice of white bread, orange juice, and oatmeal. Lunch was a meatloaf sandwich on a sub roll with barbecue sauce, whole kernel corn, and lemonade. My blood sugar is no longer being tested, and I have not been given metformin.

1pfr55w,Working Out to Eat Right vs. Working Out to Eat Wrong,"During my diabetic journey from uncontrolled diabetes, I realized I had two very different mindsets.

Mindset 1: “I work out so I can eat what I want.”

At first, this sounded great, but it didn’t help my long-term goal of ending my need for diabetic medications. It also led to unsustainable weight loss — I would drop 30 lbs, only to gain it back a few months later. After talking to many nutrition experts, I knew I had to make a change.

Mindset 2: “I work out so I can take care of my body.”

With this mindset, I made sure my nutrition provided the right fuel to hit both my workout and diabetes-management goals. The results were life-changing: I lost 100 lbs, kept it off, got off all my medications, and successfully put my diabetes into remission.

Work out to take care of your body, not to excuse your food. That mindset change changed everything for me.",1765032820.0,12,6,diabetes_t2,diabetes

downsides are doctor can’t view but also i got a bill once from her for reviewing my data so i do save that money, considering it’s me that has to work and take care of myself.

Since starting ozempic I've lost a little over 100 pounds and this is my second normal a1c. I went from being on metformin, jardiance, victoza, and one other one I can't think of the name of right now to just metformin and Ozempic. I know Ozempic is getting a lot of flack in the media, but THIS is why people call it a miracle drug and I'm so happy that it exists! ",1764999672.0,89,14,diabetes_t2,diabetes
1pffe66,I'm afraid and ashamed my doctor will hate me,"Sorry if vent posts about diabetes aren't allowed here, though I don't see a rule against it.

Context: Even after a few years of doing my best with t2, my A1c came back at a 10 recently. I was put on increased doses of a couple pills and my doctor got me Ozempic.

After starting Ozempic I went through a phase of being really really depressed, and didn't take good care of myself. I went through a sugar binge for about a week (I know, I hate myself for this) and wasn't brushing my hair let alone taking my sugar levels.

It's been two weeks since then of ""not the best"", but ""good"" behavior, diet-wise. It's all ice outside so I haven't been exercising, is the only thing. I've been experiencing a lot of daytime sleepiness, but I saw that being tired was a normal side effect of starting Ozempic so I thought nothing of it.

I finally remembered I should probably take my sugar just now, and it came back at a number so high I don't even want to repeat it. I'm praying it's a false thing, like there might have been something on my skin or my unit (the standard walmart one) had an oopsie, but I know those are unlikely scenarios. I had a child size scoop of ice cream as a treat and a few hotdog buns, based on my knowledge of myself that REALLY shouldn't have been SO bad as to lead to that kind of blood sugar number.

Seeing that, I know I should go talk to my doctor. But I just have this strong feeling of anxiety that I ""know"" I'll tell her what I've done and she'll just voice how disappointed she is and how I should have simply done better/taken better care. I'm feeling all the shame of all the fatphobia I've experienced or seen in my life, like those shows where fat people get treated like dogs for the crime of being fat and reaching for a soda. I'm feeling fear like my mind wants to think I'm going to be punished or hated for faltering. I'm so upset and stressed out.

I know what the Technically Right thing is to do here (get a dr's appt), but I'm so afraid of being judged as trash. Based on how my doctor has been in the past, I know she will shame me even if it's in relatively polite language. And honestly this is the last thing I need right now with everything else going on in my life.

I also live in a town with a population of round about 1,000, so finding a different doctor isn't precisely an option... 😭

Sorry for making a vent post, I guess what I want to know is whether anyone else has been in this position of failing to make good blood sugar choices for whatever reason and being terrified of being reviled/seen as disgusting for it...",1764992512.0,14,34,diabetes_t2,diabetes

Was forced to get carts in all types of weather which lead me to getting foot ulcers. My right foot healed just fine, but me left foot is being stubborn. Been about 6 months now and still getting treated.

I started a new job in September which would accommodate my legal blindness. Well, a month in, my foot was hurting so bad, I had to take time off and returned 6 weeks due to no income. Well, it's been 3 weeks and I'm out again for another 4 weeks. My boss said that if I have to stay out longer, then a decision will be made. So, I have 4 weeks to recover or I'm unemployed.

Aside from my rant, who here has or is dealing with foot ulcers? Did you recover or were amputations involved? So far, there are no signs of infection deeper than the wounds and they are healing, just slowly. My main issue are the pads. They get very tender after being on my feet for a while to the point I can't hardly walk around. And my job requires me to be on my feet.

1pf6d5m,Insurance switched me from the Libre 3+ to the Dexcom G7. It's like coming out of the dark ages.,"I was paying $75/month for Libre 3+ sensors, through some kind of special arrangement my insurance had with Abbott. But that went away and when I called my insurance, they said I could get a 3 month supply of the Dexcom G7 for a $40 copay.

I don't the accuracy of one vs the other. But on the technology side, the Dexcom G7 was a huge improvement. Here is my pro/con list.

# Dexcom G7

## Pros:

1. The Dexcom G7 works with my Apple Watch. Not only is there an Apple Watch app, but there is a watch complication, so I can just look down at my watch and see my blood sugar without needing to load an app.
2. The G7 directly connects to my Apple Watch AND my phone. So, I don't need my phone to see my blood sugar.
3. I haven't had any compression lows while I sleep yet.
4. I can take Vitamin C with G7 and not have it throw off my blood sugar readings.
5. There are tons of third party apps that integrate with the Dexcom software.
6. Dexcom can send your blood glucose readings to the Apple Health app.

## Cons:

1. I needed to create a Dexcom account and log in with it to use the app. I **HATE THIS** with the passion of a thousand white hot suns, but I'm willing to put up with it for now, because I'm saving $62 a month on these things. I'm looking for a way around this with a local-only 3rd party app.
2. The G7 only send updates to the phone every 5 minutes
3. Have to use an overpatch, since the glue isn't that strong.
4. Cannot turn off critical low alert
5. Sensor only lasts 10 days (new sensor that just got approved lasts 15 days, but I have a 3 month supply of the 10 day ones)

# Libre 3+

## Pros:

1. Don't need to create an account to use the app (For now... There is a new app that forces you to create an account, which sucks)
2. Sensor lasts 15 days
3. No need for an overpatch, at least for me.
4. Glucose readings are sent to the phone every minute

## Cons:

1. No Apple Watch integration even in the new app
2. No Apple Health integration even in the new app
3. No way to turn off critical low alerts

1peybzl,"I am still trying to make sense of ""A1C"" vs ""blood sugar"" and what the results mean","Every time I try to focus in on my blood sugar level (fasting) in order to determine ""diabetic"" vs ""prediabetic"" I run into a wall of disconnected information.

I am finding consistent information that an A1C result of >6.4% is ""diabetic"". I am finding consistent calculations to convert A1C to blood sugar indicated a 6.4% A1C is equivalent to a blood sugar of 137.  So, ""diabetic"" is when blood sugar > 137.

YET I also find consistent information that a blood sugar level >125 is ""diabetic"" and consistent calculations that a blood sugar of 125 is equivalent to an A1C of 6%.

Primary care doctor and Endocrinologist are telling me I need to have blood sugar >130. Conversion to blood sugar is 6.2%

So, what the heck is the limit for blood sugar?

Is it 125?

Or is it 130?

Or is it 137?

If it is 125, then I have been diabetic all my life yet nobody told me!!

Edit/Update: Thank you for all your feedback thus far. However, I believe I have a good understanding of what A1C test is and what blood sugar test is. Asking my doctor's simply results in yet more conflicting information as to what constitutes ""diabetic"" vs ""prediabetic"". Everything I find, everywhere, is totally consistent as to how to convert and A1C measurement into a ""calculated"" blood glucose level and vice-versa. So this is not a question about how to go from A1C to blood glucose and back again, either. If the answer truly is ""whatever my doctor says"" then my question becomes ""why is it that my doctor's recommendation does not match what reputable organizations state (like the ADA)? Granted, I know the answer to that question: ""ask your doctor"".

Perhaps I am simply looking for confirmation that my confusion, as I defined it, is not unusual. That many of you ""out there"" also don't actually understand why the various recommended numbers for A1C and/or blood glucose don't correlate and/or are not consistent.

Perhaps to simplify the question, it is worthwhile to make a hypothetical: For the purpose of my question let us assume that my blood glucose never varies. Never. I have such a fantastic endocrine system that my blood glucose levels, and therefore tests, are rock solid at a single value. Furthermore, my A1C blood tests are also rock solid steady state. Therefore the ""estimated"" blood glucose value, using an A1C blood test is also going to be rock solid steady state, and vice-versa. The point of the hypothetical being to eliminate any discussion of how blood glucose test is simply a single point in time whereas an A1C is an average over 2 months or 3 months or whatever.

1peu5pt,Why are my post-meal sugars still high even with good HbA1c? Need help understanding this.,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been living with type 2 diabetes for the last 3 years and I’m honestly confused and a bit frustrated. My HbA1c is always below 6.8, which seems okay… but my post-prandial sugars are consistently high, usually above 230 mg/dL.

My fasting sugar averages around 140 mg/dL, and despite trying multiple medications over the years, the pattern hasn’t really changed.

Right now I’m on:
Vildagliptin 100 mg
Pioglitazone 7.5 mg (night)

Here’s where I struggle: I live in a South Indian household, so my diet is still very carb-heavy—rice, idli, dosa, etc. I do try to include protein, but in a combined family setup it's really hard to change the everyday meal pattern.

What really confuses me is… 👉 My parents eat the same carb-heavy meals, but their post-prandial sugars stay under 180 mg/dL, which is considered normal. Meanwhile, mine shoots up even with smaller portions.

I’m trying to understand:
Why does this happen even though my HbA1c seems controlled?
What can I do to specifically control post-meal spikes?
Is this common among younger people with insulin resistance?
Do medications like Vildagliptin + Pioglitazone help with spikes over time?

Do I need to take Homa IR test?

Any advice, personal experience, or guidance from people who’ve dealt with similar post-meal issues would be really helpful. 🙏

1pdh90q,I'm confused and somewhat worried about my diabetes.,"It's been two months since my type 2 diagnosis (I'm still traumatized and scared..), and well… let's just say my diabetes is very confusing. First, some context: I use my medications like metformin and Diamicron (one pill in the morning and one pill at night, both 850 mg, and one Diamicron pill in the morning,before, I took one more, but half the dose, but my doctor reduced it)

and Toujeo insulin injections (22 units,which are long-acting insulin)

According to my doctor, I'm still producing insulin. For some reason,for now every morning my blood sugar is below 100, between 80 and 90. Before, it would even drop to 70 in the morning, which seemed strange to me, as normally for a type 2 diabetic, it's usually above 100. Also, I haven't changed my diet much, but I did replace pasta and bread with whole-wheat versions. If you're wondering, I still eat sweets and cookies because of the morning blood sugar drops. Getting my blood drawn while I have to go to school is stressful sometimes. In fact, when I saw my results, I decided to treat myself and eat a whole frozen tuna and cheese pizza. When I finished, I thought, ""Ugh, you'll see how high my blood sugar will be."" I planned to fix it by eating healthy and exercising the next day, but to my surprise, it was at 90 (yes, you heard right).

It seems my medication and insulin are effective… too effective, I'd say.

If you're wondering, today I ate several carbohydrates like potatoes and chicken, and two chocolate cookies, seeing that my blood sugar was under control. I also exercised by walking for an hour in the afternoon. The strange thing is that in the morning my blood sugar was at 82, and when I had my blood test at night, it was still at 82…

Examples: Last Friday, after my two-hour walk, I decided to treat myself to some almond ice cream. When I had my blood sugar tested, it was 107. Of course, my father got a little hysterical, but my mother told me it was best not to eat anything else and to go to sleep. The next day, surprisingly, my sugar was 70, so I had to eat sweets to raise it a bit. Another example was this Monday. My sugar was 82, and well… I neglected my diet a little. I ate sweets, nuggets, and fries… I expected my sugar to be above 90, as usual, but it was 70.

It seems my treatment with the medications and Toujeo insulin is working well…too well, in fact.

While I'm happy because this way I'll avoid complications from the disease, I'm also confused and worried. Since I can only prick my finger in the morning and at night, I never know how much sugar I have during the day. I asked for a sensor, but my doctor refused. I thought I might actually have Type 1.5, not Type 2, because of my weight (75 kilos) and my age (20 years old).But I don't think so. because I have acontosis nigricans, which is caused by insulin resistance, so I do have Type 2. In fact, I still have the dark spots. Also, at the hospital, during my diagnosis, they drew blood and had me urinate for testing, and my doctor told me I definitely have Type 2. If I had Type 1.5, she would have told me at the hospital. That's why I want to ask young people with the disease if they've experienced this.

Is this normal? At least in the first few months? Can I start the diet without problems? (The low blood sugar is the reason I didn't.) It's like I'm not diabetic… But I know I will continue to be. Please,for now im fine but I'm a little scared and I don't know what to do. Do I have to wait until my next appointment with my doctor to ask…",1764797738.0,0,14,diabetes_t2,diabetes

First, newly diagnosed back in August. Second, thanks for all the good information I see here. Some of it’s pretty inspiring. 

Me? Not so much. I’m trying to get my levels under control. Mostly through diet and a little exercise. 6’ 240 male. My numbers during the day will go from 120-250. Oh, and 500mg of the ol’ Metformin. 

Anyway, I started trying to do the fasting thing. I eat at around 7pm. Then I don’t eat again until at least 11am next day. Sensible lunch, boring dinner (can I get heckya from the T2 folks?!?) 😀

Here’s my question. The last week, no medicine for one. Fasting and watching my meals. I check my blood sugar right before meal it’s 158! I haven’t ate for 16 hours, I’m going nuts for anything. My coworkers plant is looking good. 

About 90 minutes after my lunch of grilled chicken on a salad with tomatoes cucumbers and oil and vinegar, I check my numbers again, 157???

This is my dilemma. Two days ago, first reading 151…second reading after two plain small chicken breasts (palm size)….160!

Am I missing something or doing something wrong? My physician isn’t a lot of help. He just keeps telling me it will take time.

Over these two years the highest my A1C has been is 6.1. My most recent reading is 5.7. The lowest I’ve ever got my A1C to since my diagnosis was 5.6.

I was bracing for this one to be higher than usual. I had some steroid treatments for a stubborn back and hadn’t been as active as I’d like to have been.

Anyway 5.7 was a delightful surprise!

Generally my methodology is to test quite a bit. I probably test 6 a 8 times a day. I test to decide when to eat, what to eat, and how much to eat.

My goal is for my 2 hour post meal numbers to be under 140 and I hit that mark most of the time.

Don’t forget to drink water. That’s one of the easiest things to do and for whatever reason the hardest thing to remember/motivate myself to do. Without water your numbers can just hang high and come down way too slow.

Carb and sugar awareness: Knowing which foods raise blood sugar and how to pair them with protein, fiber, or fat to keep levels stable.

Flexibility without fear: I can enjoy natural sugars and carbs without jeopardizing my control.

Sustainable habits: This is about long-term health, not perfection or obsessing over a single number.

1paebv4,Is A1C 5.9 good enough? My experience with diabetes,"It's been almost a year since my T2D diagnosis. 

I am 30 years old. When I got diagnosed I was 82kg, so basically a BMI of 26.8. My diabetes is a combination of many factors, high body fat was part of it but what broke me was my severe sleep apnea, which I must have had since I was a kid due to my face shape.

My sleep study showed I suffered 81 apneas per hour, which caused my blood oxygen saturation to drop very low for more than 55% of my sleep time, every damn day for possibly more than 15 years. My endo determined this was the root cause for my diabetes, accounting for all factors. 

Last year, before the apnea and diabetes diagnosis, was the worst I've ever been health wise, I'd get fatigued after walking for 10 min or doing dishes, I couldn't focus on reading books, watching movies or even playing videogames that weren't very high dopamine *cough* League of Legends *cough*, my anxiety levels were through the roof and now I feel like I hadn't felt this energetic since I was a kid, like I had been living in hard mode.

So I got diagnosed with dangerous levels of blood sugars, A1C 12.8 and started on metformin 1600mg. 3 months after I dropped them to 6.2. Right now we've lowered medication to 800mg and I'm at 5.9.

The question is, I've seen many people here pushing for lower A1C and to be honest, I don't know if I want that. It's been difficult learning to live with this condition and I'm managing okay.

My PCP was really happy to see my results. She said that I'm only 30 and that I don't need to measure meals in an obsessive manner (it's very hard for me), like, it's okay if I eat a paella every once in a while despite it giving me a terrible glucose curve for a few hours, as long as I keep good habits most of the time. I postponed eating sushi for months because I was basically scared of carbs haha, but I'm eating a normal amount, around 50-130g per day. My PCP even recommended me to have a bit more of protein and carbs because I was compensating the lack of carbs with saturated fats and my triglycerides raised a little.

So this has been my first year as a young T2D. Anyone else has been in a similar spot? I don't know if I try to push for full remission or just try to relax since I'm below target (7%). Diabetes still scares the hell out of me.",1764495486.0,38,32,diabetes_t2,diabetes

I am currently 184 lbs and I am approximately 5”9, my doctor would like me to lose a significant amount of weight and has been disappointed in me for not losing weight. I just started mounjaro a few weeks ago, and I’m feeling a bit anxious due to my doctors repeated pressure on me to lose weight. I wouldn’t say i’m in the best shape, but I would not necessarily say I am severely overweight either. I would like to lose weight not to please my doctor, but in an attempt to better my life as I am still young. I am taking mounjaro seriously and have been doing lots of research about what to eat/expect, but I’m just curious to see if anyone has advice out there for me on how to lose weight on this medication, and also what a proper diet should entail while being on this medication. Any help would be great thank you to anyone who takes time to reply to this!",1764394922.0,4,11,diabetes_t2,diabetes
1p9gxsv,Weird tartar buildup in my mouth since T2 diagnosis,"So I know that diabetes can lead to less saliva production and increase the possibility of dental issues. But the chemistry in my mouth has been weird since I was diagnosed last summer (and prescribed metformin), and I'm wondering if it's a side effect or just a coincidence.

Tartar has always formed in my mouth somewhat regularly (I'm a bit of a mouth breather), and I see my dentist for a perio cleaning every three months. I'm generally good about brushing and flossing. I'm a 55M, and the metformin combined with eating smarter and near-daily exercise beyond just walking have helped a lot -- I feel great, my blood sugar, A1C (5.7%) and my liver numbers are more normal, and I've lost 20 pounds.

I moved up my latest dentist appointment after noticing unusual staining on my teeth. The staining was thankfully just staining, but the tartar that had built up was worse than it has ever been. My dentist really had to go to town on my teeth to scrape it off and said it was harder tartar than normal for me.

That was four weeks ago, and even though I'm even more diligent about my oral health and keeping my mouth hydrated, the staining is starting to re-emerge, and I'm assuming the hard tartar isn't far behind.

My dentist said he has other patients on metformin and has never seen anything this abrupt with them. He's befuddled and asked if my diet changed -- if anything, I'm eating better, maybe a little more calcium (a couple cups of spinach 3-4 times a week, and baby carrots a couple times a week as a snack, and oh I love cheese :) but really not much more than before. 

Has anyone experienced something like this after being diagnosed and going on metformin? And what did you do? ",1764394652.0,1,5,diabetes_t2,diabetes

1p9fund,True Metrix blood glucose meter question,"Hello all. I had a quick question. So ive been using a True Metrix blood glucose meter for a few weeks now. Ive been using it in my place of residence but wanted to show my parents how it works because they were curious about it since im a new diabetic.

My question is wondering if my device might have been damaged while I transported my meter to and from my parents house? Im saying this because its cold where I live 21F (-6C) and had my meter in the car. On my way to my parents house it only took me 10 minutes and it wasn't too cold in the car (probably above 60F) so i dont think this would damage the meter.

However, when I left my parents house to go to my own house, I took the meter with me in the car. Before arriving home, I stopped to get some gas and a drink at the gas station while leaving the meter in my car. The ride from my parents house to my house, including the gas fill up, was about 40 minutes. While I was driving I had some heat on but not too much and while I wasn't in my car the heat was off. 

Im just wondering if I exposed the meter to too much of the cold and if it may be damaged? Ill do a control solution test with my glucose strips to see if the readings are still accurate.

I looked online and it said to not keep your meter, test strips, and test solutions in the cold for too long or they can be damaged. I took all three with me today.",1764391157.0,1,2,diabetes_t2,diabetes

1p9a7p5,So tired of living this way,"I hold a lot of guilt for becoming diabetic. My dad and grandpa have it, so I know it has to do with genetics, but I still feel so embarrassed to struggle with diabetes. I never took it seriously, until this last year. I was at a stable A1C while eating unhealthy, but taking metformin for years. This last year, when I had my A1C checked in June it was a 9.2. I had a huge wakeup call, and began to go on walks and eat healthy. I was really trying to get my life back on track. 

I started to lose weight (5'6, 190 pounds down to 180 pounds) and thought I was doing better. But then, when I would go on walks, I would become hypoglycemic and my blood sugar would drop dangerously low. My A1C was still high, so my doctor put me on ozempic. 

I feel like I am fighting a losing battle. I struggle to get out of bed because my blood sugar is so back and forth, and I feel like I miss out on a lot of life because I didn't take my diabetes seriously until this year due to guilt. I want to be better, so I'm still making an effort to lose weight and be healthy.

These last few weeks since starting ozempic, it has been very hard to go on walks or eat at all. I feel so guilty for laying in bed so much, but my new medicine makes me have migraines and I am always tired. I'm just so tired of living this way, and I'm scared I will always be like this. 

Does anyone else deal with guilt? I try not to feel embarrassed or guilty, but barely anyone in my life knows I deal with diabetes. I hold a lot of resentment for people who can eat anything and their health not be affected. I don't want to feel this way anymore. I just wish I was healthy.

I was diagnosed with T2 (among other issues) in July and since then have made incredible progress on a combo of metformin and Mounjaro, with my weight dropping by 25% and my A1C going from 9.2 to 5.0 since then.

Since I'm not on insulin, insurance would not cover a CGM, so I've been fingersticking a couple of times a day (was more often before A1C dropped) and have never had a hypoglycemic reading. Out of curiosity and an abundance of caution, I got a Stelo CGM prior to Thanksgiving since it would be the first time in months I've eaten without knowing exactly what was going into me as far as carbs, etc.

In the past several days it's been showing 5-10 <70mg/dl measurements a night while I sleep. I can't really go by ""feelings"" here since I have the added complication of a neurological hypersomnia disorder that always leaves me feeling low energy at baseline regardless of glucose.

1p8uhrm,What type of diabetic am I? (250g of carbs a day),"I was diagnosed with T2D when I was 28 years old, I’m now 45. My A1C is 5.2. I inject 5mg of Mounjaro every 4 weeks. I workout fasted most days (30 minutes in the morning) and will sometimes go for a walk before dinner when I get home from work. This is not new, I lost 80lbs to reach my goal weight in 2024 and have now kept it off for a year. 

With that being said, I eat around 250g of carbs a day. They are mostly natural carbs. I try to never eat carbs alone. For example, I eat rice almost daily (white or brown), but it would be with broccoli or brussels sprouts,  and salmon or chicken. I also eat sweet potatoes, 647 bread, and some protein pasta. I eat are all types of fruits (bananas, cantaloupe, strawberries, apples, pineapple, oranges, etc). 

I believe in balance. I balance my carbs with protein and fat. I balance my meals with working out. I don’t drink calories/carbs. 

In conversations with others, some will make think I’m no longer a diabetic, but I know better. In the past, my A1C has gone back up to 13.2 thinking I was “normal” and could eat whatever I wanted.

1p8tzjs,How to talk openly and constructively with your doctor about T2…,"A lot of people with type 2 diabetes only get part of the picture when they are diagnosed. They hear the A1C result, maybe get a prescription, and they are told to “watch carbs” and come back in a few months. The issue is that type 2 diabetes is not one single problem. It is a cluster of metabolic problems that can look different from person to person. Understanding your own pattern makes a huge difference in how you approach food, activity, medication, and long term health.

Here are some things you can talk about with your doctor. None of this is about pushing for tests you do not need. It is about getting enough information to understand what is going on inside your own body so you can make decisions based on something solid.

First, talk about glucose targets. Ask your doctor what they want your fasting glucose to be. Ask what your readings should look like two hours after meals. Ask how quickly they expect those numbers to improve with whatever plan they are putting you on. When you know what you’re aiming for, you can stop guessing whether you are doing well.

You might ask: “What should my fasting glucose be? What should my numbers be two hours after meals? How much variation is normal for someone in my situation?”

This gives you real numbers to work with instead of guessing.

Next, ask about the markers that help build a full metabolic picture. Many specialists look at A1C, fasting glucose, a lipid panel, liver enzymes, kidney markers, fasting insulin or C peptide, and sometimes an oral glucose tolerance test. These tests give clues about two major pieces of type 2 diabetes: how resistant your cells are to insulin, and how well your beta cells are able to keep up. You do not need to become an expert, but it helps to know that high fasting insulin can point toward insulin resistance, while low C peptide can suggest your pancreas is slowing down. Both situations require different conversations with your doctor.

You might ask: “I know A1C is important, but I have read that fasting glucose, liver enzymes, kidney markers, fasting insulin or C peptide, and a lipid panel can give a fuller picture. Based on my case, which of these do you think are useful, and why?”

This shows you are trying to understand, not demanding unnecessary tests.

It is also worth asking your doctor how they think about treatment. Some people respond well to one medication. Others benefit from combining medications that work in different ways. Research by people like Ralph DeFronzo shows that tackling insulin resistance, liver glucose production, and beta cell strain at the same time helps many people stabilise faster. You are not asking for anything extreme here. You are simply asking your doctor to explain the reasoning behind your plan, and whether other options could help you reach your targets sooner.

You might ask: “Do you have a sense of whether my main challenge is insulin resistance, beta cell strain, or both? And does that influence how you choose medications for me?”

This helps you understand the why behind your treatment plan.

You might also ask: “I would like to understand the plan you think is best for me. Do you see this as something we manage with one medication, or do you think using medications that work in different ways could help me reach healthy numbers faster?”

This leaves the decision entirely in the doctor’s hands but invites a more complete explanation.

It also helps to talk with your doctor about lifestyle in a way that is realistic instead of vague. Many people are told to lose weight or cut carbs without any explanation of what will actually move the needle for their specific situation. A useful way to frame it is to ask which changes will have the biggest impact for someone with your pattern. For one person it might be walking after meals because the liver is overactive. For another it might be more protein because their post meal spikes are sharp. For someone else the priority may be sleep or stress because cortisol is pushing their glucose up. A short, honest conversation about what is practical for you and what your doctor thinks will matter most can take a lot of guesswork out of the process.

You might ask: “I want to make changes that are sustainable. Can you tell me which changes will have the biggest impact on my numbers based on how my body is responding?”

This helps you prioritize without getting overwhelmed.

There are moments when seeing an endocrinologist is useful. This includes persistent high numbers despite your best efforts, unexplained swings, symptoms of low blood sugar, rapid weight changes, or lab results that raise questions about beta cell function. Sometimes your primary doctor will manage everything well. Sometimes a specialist can offer a clearer explanation or a more nuanced plan.

You might ask: “Under what circumstances would you recommend that I see an endocrinologist? I’m not asking for a referral right now… I just want to know what signs to watch for.”

Doctors appreciate questions like this because it shows you respect their judgment.

Finally, remember that this is not about perfection. It is about clarity. The more you understand about your own biology, the less room there is for fear, confusion, or guilt. Most of us do better when we understand what is happening rather than trying to follow rules without knowing why.

You might ask (and, frankly, this might be one of the first questions to ask): “I want to understand what is happening in my body, not just what my A1C number is. Can we talk through how you see my situation and what you think the main issues are for me right now?”

This opens the door for your doctor to explain their thinking instead of just giving instructions.

If you are new to type 2 diabetes or feeling lost, a short conversation with your doctor about these points can give you a much stronger foundation. It can also help you catch problems early and give you a sense of control over your own health.

1p8jkw0,Stopping Metformin Cold,"After two consecutive blood tests showed and A1C of 4.5-4.6, my primary care physician had me drop my T2 meds. I achieved these results through diet and exercise, supported by my meds. First he had me drop Jardiance, and that went fine. Another 4.6 A1C. Then he had me drop Victoza/Liraglutide and Metformin. He recommended I stop cold turkey.

That was bad. Very bad. The first week was fine. Started wearing a CGM to monitor the impact, and blood sugar wise all was fine. After a week, though, my digestive system freaked out. I became incredibly constipated. Stool softeners and miralax did not help at all. I started having debilitating flank pain that I attributed to a kidney stone (which I’ve had twice before). Had no idea constipation could be so painful.

Wound up in the ER in agony convinced it was the kidney stone. After a CT scan they found that the problem was the constipation. They put me on meds for that and finally now two days later I’m feeling somewhat normal again. The ER also had me resume my Metformin until this settles down.

I think if we do this again I will taper off. I was on 2000 mg ER per day. I expected some impact from changing med routine, but I did not expect impaction (nearly) to result. Blood sugar wise it seems the meds aren’t essential, but for weight loss they seem to be important.

My diagnosis completely changed and honestly, sometimes feels like it wrecked my relationship with food.

For context, I’m 24M and my last A1C was 5.2. I’ve been out of the diabetic range for 2.5 years now (I was diagnosed at 21) purely through lifestyle changes. My endocrinologist even described me as an “overachiever” and recommended moving my bloodwork from every 3 months to every 6 months. I was also told I could test my blood sugar only as needed due to my health anxiety and discipline. On top of that, I weight train and do cardio 4x a week.

Despite all these wins, I still feel like I’m losing, especially around the holidays. I feel intense guilt eating foods I know will spike me, even when I genuinely want to indulge. It becomes this constant internal battle that feels mentally exhausting. I know logically that one or two off days every now and then won’t derail my progress or numbers, but every time I eat something that could spike me, it feels like I’m actively hurting my body and pushing myself closer to insulin, blacking out from reactive hypoglycemia, or worse.

1p8238u,Learn the basics of what is happening in your body…,"One of the biggest turning points for me was finally understanding what type 2 diabetes actually is on a biological level. Not the surface level version of “your blood sugar is high” but what is happening inside your body that makes it happen. Once you understand that, everything else becomes easier to navigate. Food choices make sense. Medications make sense. Exercise makes sense. You stop feeling lost.

Type 2 diabetes starts with insulin resistance. Insulin is a hormone your pancreas makes. Its job is simple. It tells your cells to open up and take in glucose from your bloodstream so you can use it for energy. When you are insulin resistant, your cells do not respond properly to that signal. They behave as if insulin is whispering instead of speaking clearly.

Your body tries to compensate. The pancreas pushes out more insulin to force the message through. This works for a while but it also hides the problem. Your blood sugar stays normal on the surface because your pancreas is working hard behind the scenes.

Over time the system breaks down. Your muscles, liver, and fat cells all stay resistant. Your pancreas gets tired from constantly pushing out more insulin. Your liver becomes confused and starts releasing extra glucose even when you do not need it. This is one reason fasting glucose often goes up first. It is not because of what you ate at dinner the night before. It is your liver slowly trickling sugar into your bloodstream when it should be quiet.

When resistance becomes strong enough, your pancreas cannot keep up with the demand. Blood sugar rises as the result of insulin resistance that has been building for years.

Understanding this helps you see why certain changes work.

When you eat meals with more protein and fibre and fewer fast hitting carbs, you reduce the glucose spikes that force your pancreas to produce big bursts of insulin. That gives the system room to calm down.

When you walk, especially after meals, your muscles use more glucose directly. They open up to glucose without needing as much insulin. This lowers insulin resistance over time.

When you lift weights or do any kind of strength training, your muscles become bigger glucose sinks. Bigger muscles can store more glucose and need less insulin to do it. This is one of the most powerful tools you have.

When you lose even a small amount of weight, especially around your midsection, your cells respond to insulin better. The communication between insulin and the cells becomes clearer.

When you sleep well and manage stress, your hormones settle and your liver stops dumping out as much glucose.

And medications fit into this picture too. Some tell the liver to calm down. Some help your muscles use glucose more effectively. Some support the pancreas. Some reduce resistance directly. They are not patch jobs. They target real mechanisms in the system.

The point is that type 2 diabetes is not about weak willpower or “bad sugar habits.” It is a metabolic communication problem between insulin and your cells. The good news is that this system can change. Your body can become more responsive again. Your liver can quiet down. Your pancreas can get a break. Your numbers can drop.

You are not stuck. If anything, understanding what is happening gives you a roadmap. It shows you which levers you can pull to improve things. And once you understand the science on a simple level, managing diabetes stops feeling like guesswork and starts feeling like something you can actually control.

Keep going!

1p7z4ao,Diabetes made me realize I'm lactose intolerant,"Just a little funny story for you. 

So I was always kinda bloaty before my diagnosis. The bloating started about 2 years ago but I never thought I might be LI.

Fast forward to 2 months ago when I got diagnosed with diabetes with pretty high numbers. I took drastic measures and went low carb. I also cut out dairy because I don't use sweeteners daily, only for desserts and treats once in a while, and I hate unsweetened tea/coffee and I also dislike black tea and black coffee, so I decided to just drink water or lemon + salt + unflavoured soda instead. My bloating went away. I had good energy and my bowel movements went from a strain to magical within days. I falsely attributed that to cutting out sugar.

Then I went on vacation for a month, and decided that I can have my non caloric sweeteners daily during that time. Cue me drinking a lot of tea. I noticed the bloating was back, but I thought it was just the change in the climate, change in the available food, etc. I even tested myself once before and after tea and there was no difference and I thought AWESOME! Milk doesn't increase my BG at all. 

Then I started having even more milk. On one occassion early in the vacation, I had 2 glasses of very milky cold coffee. 250 ml each. 

The bloating that followed was absolutely horrendous. I couldn't sit because it hurt so much. I was constantly walking, and constantly farting and burping. Couldn't poop the next morning, and woke up multiple times during the night because of pain.

That's when I googled and realized that the reason milk doesn't affect my blood glucose is because my body can't process it.

Now I'm back to my lemon water and lemon sodas, and trying to develop a taste for black tea :')

I did treat myself to some almond milk lattes on my birthday and a couple more times on vacation, though.",1764239900.0,7,6,diabetes_t2,diabetes

1p7srxf,So you got diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and now you are wondering what to do next…,"This is the moment most of us remember. You leave the clinic with a mix of fear, confusion, and a stack of advice that all sounds important but hard to act on. Here is what I wish someone had told me right away.

First, take a breath. You are not broken. Your body has been pushed in the wrong direction for a long time and now you have a chance to turn it around. Many people bring their numbers down through changes in food, movement, sleep, stress management, and medication. Nothing about this diagnosis means your future is written.

Learn the basics of what is happening in your body. Type 2 diabetes is about insulin resistance. Your cells do not respond well to insulin so your pancreas pushes harder, your liver releases more glucose than you need, and blood sugar stays elevated. When you understand this, the lifestyle changes and medications make much more sense.

Talk openly with your doctor. Ask about targets for fasting glucose, post meal readings, and A1C. Ask what medications they recommend and why. Ask if a multi drug approach makes sense, because research shows that hitting the problem from several angles can help many people reach healthy numbers sooner.

Get a glucose meter and start tracking. Look at your fasting number in the morning and check two hours after meals. You will learn very quickly which foods help you and which foods spike you. This is the beginning of taking control.

Shift your food choices. You do not need to starve yourself. You do not need extreme diets. Start by increasing protein and fibre. Add vegetables. Reduce sugar, refined carbs, and anything that hits fast and hard. You will see the difference within days. Focus on meals that give you steady energy. Pay attention to portions of foods like bread, rice, pasta, and sweets. They are not forbidden but you need to know your response to them.

Move your body every day. It does not need to be intense. Walking 10 to 15 minutes after meals can lower your glucose noticeably. Strength training a few days a week helps reduce insulin resistance. Think long term. You do not need to become an athlete. You only need to be consistent.

Sleep matters. Stress matters. When you are tired or anxious, your body releases hormones that push glucose up. Small changes help. Go to bed earlier. Take short breaks during the day. Try breathing exercises. It adds up.

Do not compare yourself to others. Some people see fast results. Some people take longer. What matters is the direction of your numbers and how you feel day to day.

You will have days when your readings go the wrong way. It happens to everyone. Do not give up. Look at the pattern over weeks, not a single spike.

Most of all, understand that you can change this. You can get healthier. You can lose weight. You can bring your A1C down. You can reduce or even stop medication if that becomes safe for you down the road. You can feel better than you have in years.

If you are reading this after your diagnosis, you are already doing the right thing. You are learning and taking ownership of your health. Keep going.",1764217180.0,71,22,diabetes_t2,diabetes

1p729cq,Family history of type 2 diabetes — and two questions I can’t solve,"My family has a lot of type 2 diabetes. My grandmother had it, two of my dad’s brothers have it, and my dad didn’t have diabetes originally but was diagnosed around age 70. On my grandmother’s side there are also relatives with diabetes, though I don’t remember the details clearly.

My grandmother spent the last six months of her life in the ICU and had a leg amputated because of diabetic foot. That experience shocked me deeply.

From watching my family, I honestly believe a lot of it came from lifestyle — in China people eat a lot of rice, often to the point of being overfull, with diets low in protein, high in fast carbs, and very little exercise. Across three generations in my family, everyone tended to be on the heavier side. When I was close to 30, I finally understood this and started changing my own habits.

At that time, because I inherited the same eating and activity patterns, I was also overweight. My BMI was 30, and I had fatty liver.

Then I started making changes:

1. Drinking 2–3 liters of water a day.
2. Hiring an auntie to help with daily life and prepare three balanced meals with enough protein, fiber, and slow carbs (I didn’t eat white rice for a long time — mostly mixed grains).
3. Becoming a bit obsessed with tennis, and more recently rowing. My weekly routine now includes 7–10 hours of strength training + sport sessions.
4. Fixing my sleep schedule and making sure I get at least 7 hours.

After doing these things, my BMI dropped from 30 to 22 within a year. These habits also influenced my parents — our whole family shifted from fast-carb meals to a “protein-first, high-fiber, slow-carb” way of eating. Their weight also dropped significantly.

But I’m struggling with something now. For the past few years, I’ve been trying to convince my parents that:

**1. Strength training matters — even at 60–70 years old.**

* Muscle is the body’s biggest “glucose sink.” Over 70% of blood glucose disposal happens in skeletal muscle, not the liver or insulin alone.
* More muscle → more stable blood sugar response to the same amount of carbs.
* Strength training is one of the most effective ways to improve insulin sensitivity.

But in China, the fitness culture isn’t strong. The traditional mindset is to “rest more” as you get older, and my parents worry about injuries, so they’ve never done any strength training.

**2. My dad keeps eating late-night “sugar-free” snacks because he fears low blood sugar at night.**

He has diabetes and is afraid of going low while sleeping, so at around 11pm he eats “sugar-free” crackers. I really think those crackers are just a commercial trick — no added sugar doesn’t mean no carbs, and they’re full of additives.

I had him wear a CGM for a while, but the CGM often showed his glucose dipping to the lower end of the normal range at night, and that made him anxious enough to eat again. I don’t think this habit is healthy.

I just want to have a long and healthy lifespan. To me, that requires a sustainable lifestyle — not something extreme, not a temporary push, but habits you can stick to for decades. I hope that as I get older, I can avoid the type 2 diabetes that has been so common in my family.",1764144565.0,8,5,diabetes_t2,diabetes

I'm asking because I get the feeling that I’m not alone, and want to know what others did for themselves.

I was diagnosed with pre-diabetes in March of 2023 after a routine physical blood test, but I was never informed that said results came in by my doctor.

It was never mentioned in any appointment following said blood test, and I had no clue l'd had an elevated blood sugar. It was not mentioned in any appointment summary, either, only delivered in the form of an automatic result notification that I never knew I could access.

My main issue is the fact that diabetes was never mentioned once to me, in any routine health check or specific visit. My doctor never talked about my results with me; I only was informed via said notification I had to go digging for.

I was officially diagnosed with type 2 diabetes last May, in 2024, after a medical emergency as a result of untreated sugar levels. It came as a complete shock, because like I said- it had never been mentioned. But the risks had been documented.

Honestly my support system has been really good but I just feel kinda lost. I don't like the fact that now I have to be more conscious/mindful of what I'm eating. Sometimes I just wanna eat whatever I want, when I want, instead of making sure I eat the right amounts of protein, carbs, fiber, etc. 

Every time I mention it people just say ""oh you can eat whatever in moderation, you just have to be careful about it"" like that's the point I don't want!!! I don't want to think or be careful sometimes!!! I know that as I get things more under control, itll come easier. This is just me kinda ranting I guess. 

Also I completely understand that everyone means well but I'm kinda just getting so pissed off with everybody who is offering me advice but never experienced it. Like I've heard so many people say ""oh well when I did keto, I ate this"" or ""I eat so much sugar I'm surprised I don't have diabetes"" or the WORST ""my grandpas ex cousin etc has diabetes and he does this""! 

I don't mind advice at all, it's just kinda frustrating to have all these thoughts about my new, kinda intimidating diagnosis, and people who have no like experience want to tell me how to react or what to do. I have been lurking in this sub for a bit, and I think it's nice to just finally talk to people who can relate. Thank y'all for listening to my rant lol",1763919994.0,25,37,diabetes_t2,diabetes

I was formally diagnosed with T2D just over 2 months ago (August). I’ve been extremely aggressive with lifestyle changes, and my doctor has decided **NOT to medicate me** due to my ""success"".

## My Rapid Progress & Doctor’s Decision:

* **Weight Loss:** Lost over **10 kg** total since June (over **8 kg** since diagnosis focus).
* **T2D Reversal:** My initial HbA1c was 6.5%, and I immediately brought it down to **6.2%** (currently in the Pre-Diabetic range).
* **Liver Health:** My liver enzymes (ALT) **normalized**, and a recent ultrasound confirmed that my **Fatty Liver is resolved**.

## The Metabolic Mystery (The Main Concern):

Despite my success and the absence of medication, my body shows strange instability:

1.  **Stubborn Visceral Fat:** I lost 10 kg, but my Visceral Fat Index is **stuck in the High-Risk Range**. 
2.  **Nocturnal Hypo Crashes:** I regularly experience asymptomatic hypoglycemia (lows in the 60s and 70s mg/dL) at night or after intense workouts. **I am NOT on insulin or any medication.**
3.  **High Morning Glucose Rebound:** My glucose often rebounds and is **high in the morning** (in the 115–130 mg/dL range).

## My Question to the Community:

* Have you experienced this severe **low-to-high instability without being on medication**?

1p4hga6,Body playing games with Trajenta,"Started Trajenta and began using CGM on Nov 11. Body seemed to respond well because sugars went up and down, like a mountain.

Now we are entering third week with Trajenta.

Saw doc yesterday. Doc said I’m doing well. Keep eating like now, will see him again in 4 weeks time.

Then yesterday my body decided to play games (coz Doc said I did well? lol). 
For meals with 15g of carbs or less, no spike at all. For other meals the sugar can go up and down rather quickly, stay low, then spike again within the last 45-30 minutes of the two hours post meal window. Made my postprandial number higher than my numbers on the first week when I first started Trajenta.

Is the body adjusting to Trajenta on a weekly basis? 

What’s the full power of Trajenta? Feels rather weak to me. I’m ready to add metformin but doc didn’t want to coz I’m underweight and my current goal now is to gain weight and slowly increase my carb intake (turns out my liver suffered a lot because of a lack of carbs). 

But I have to say this- it feels great eating carbs in moderation again though my sugar goes up but it does come down like a mountain. I like this new normal.

1p49vxn,I let it rip,"Diagnosed about a month ago. Have been tracking meals consistently and limiting carbs and trying to be active following meals as much as possible. Signed up for the free trial Libre 3 plus sensor and have gotten so much valuable info and insight on how certain foods and activities affect numbers.

Last night was the first time since diagnosis that I let it go. We were out for my birthday, dinner and a concert. 3 beers, onion rings, fried cheese curds, burger and fries. It was glorious. The one condition I made was that we walked from dinner to the concert venue, about 15 minutes. I didn’t check the app until this morning. Obviously you can tell when I ate/drank 🤣🤣. 

behavior changes that are probably the biggest thing is only one drink at the concert and not drinking or late night eating after we got home, which would have pretty much been automatic pre-dx. CGM and finger stick tests were back around 100 this morning.

I was happy to see that my body responded somewhat to the spike and the walk probably helped, and today we are back on track with mindful eating and tracking. It was a much needed night out with friends and my wife (we share a birthday, oddly enough). I’ve got about 5 days left on the free trial Libre sensor, not sure if I’ll continue because it’s not likely to be covered by insurance (pharmacy encouraged a prior authorization request but I’m not holding my breath).

1p3vqsn,"I was diagnosed a year ago, today","One year ago, I was in the emergency room of my local hospital. I had come in with a wound on my leg that wouldn't heal, but I also suspected I was diabetic. I had been treating a yeast infection for a while, and it kept coming back. I was incredibly thirsty a lot of the time, which led to increased urination. I had no appetite and food repulsed me. And I was exhausted, napping or wanting to nap twice a day.

I was in HHS -  a diabetic crisis with a 10-20% fatality rate. My blood sugar was at over 700 and my A1C was 15+. This had caused an acute kidney injury, and my eGFR was 25. The leg had cellulitis. I was essentially dying.

They put me on insulin and debrided my leg. I spent twelve days in the hospital getting blood sugar down and having my wounds treated. Then I was released, pretty much sure I was dying but glad I'd get to do it at home.

My A1C is now 5.1. My kidneys recovered from the injury, got re-injured by a bad med choice and recovered again - eGFR is now 96. I have lost 125 lbs. I quit smoking. I work out 70 minutes a day, every day. I feel incredible.

I'm not happy to have diabetes, but I'm glad I got it. I don't know if that makes any sense, but hopefully this is a group that will get what I mean. I will live longer with diabetes than I would have without it, because diabetes forced me to adopt a healthier lifestyle. It's been the hardest year of my life, and one of the most rewarding.

This year starting from March I took metformin 1000mg only and my A1C reduced to 7.7, after that I started dieting and reduced my metformin and then my A1C went to 5.7 I lost around 9kgs. After that I wanted to test if my diabetes was able to go into remission and I started eating normally again (bad diet) now I gained 3kgs back and my A1C went to 5.7 to 6.2 to 6.5. 

So I know that I will be diabetic forever, but is it possible for me to eat whatever I want, but excercise and manage to stay the same weight and will that keep my A1C stable?

Jun 24th I woke up with a very heavy head and I knew something is wrong. Held my BP machine and woaah 190/100 took it again now more anxious 200/120. 
Straight to my doc who doubled up the med for a week and wrote me a complete diabetes special checkup. Hmmm 9.5 it is !!! I was devastated and took me weeks to sync in that I just can't eat anything which i loved. This is chronic!!! And then I started doing desperate search and that's where I found this place.

1p21pva,Small Daily Habits That Helped Me Keep My Blood Sugar More Stable (Sharing My Experience),"Over the last few months, I’ve been trying to understand how small daily actions affect energy levels, mood, and especially blood sugar. I’m not a doctor and I’m not giving medical advice, but I wanted to share a few habits that personally helped me feel more stable throughout the day. Maybe it helps someone else, and I’d also love to learn what has worked for others.

**1. Walking for 10–15 minutes after meals**  
This one was a game-changer. Even a slow walk after eating made a big difference in how heavy or tired I felt. It reduces post-meal spikes, and it’s easy to do.

**2. Eating protein before carbs**  
This was new to me. When I eat a small piece of protein (like yogurt, eggs, or nuts) before the carb part of my meal, I feel fewer crashes later. It’s a simple trick, but surprisingly effective.

**3. Staying hydrated**  
I noticed that mornings when I start the day with 1–2 glasses of water, my overall energy stays more stable. Dehydration actually affects glucose levels more than I realized.

**4. Managing stress**  
Deep breathing, short breaks, and mindfulness helped more than expected. Stress spikes blood sugar even without food, and I didn’t know that until recently.

**5. Avoiding “no breakfast” days**  
Skipping breakfast always led to overeating or sugar cravings later, so now I start with something balanced—protein + fiber.

**6. Sleep routine**  
Going to bed at the same time helps my body keep things more balanced. Sleep had a bigger impact than I thought.

I’m sharing these purely because they helped me, and I’m curious to learn from others too.

Diagnosed at 9.0 about a year ago. Started 500mg metformin once a day and did nothing else (was dealing with a cancer scare at the same time, had no headspace for the diabetes). Kept up with my regular daily walks and occasional swims. 

Tested again 9 months later, was down to 8.1 with just that small dose of metformin. Dr wanted to increase the dose but I opted to take it seriously and make food and lifestyle changes first. 

I do not have insurance, nor do I have money to pay for endocrinologists and nutritionists, so I've done this mostly on my own. 

For the last three months, I've: 

\- Kept taking my 500mg metformin 1/day

\- Done cardio classes 3-4 times a week, every week

\- Strength training or Pilates once a week

\- Increased my walking, started actually counting steps, walking with purpose, etc. 

\- Cut out almost all sugar and most carbs without making myself entirely miserable and crazy. 

\- Really focused on increasing protein, something that's been hard for me in the past. 

Just tested again and I'm down to 6.7

While I have been making progress in lowering my A1C through medications and dieting, plus being more active, I am admittedly horrible about regularly testing and tracking my blood glucose levels. Recently I have been making a more concerted effort to better control my T2, after a few bad months of depression which caused overeating and missing my weekly Ozempic. I have also been dealing with the mental health side of things, and some other physical issues that have resulted from depression and anxiety. My psychologist recommended that I try a Dexcom since I am a ‘gadget person’ and like to analyze data and facts. 

Here is my main question, I am a particularly sweaty person. Some of that comes with my day job as a Fire Safety inspector, where I walk 10-12,000 steps a day conducting inspections, up and down stairs, and in hot, cramped mechanical rooms. I am also part of a Hazmat Response team for my employer (University EHS) and in addition to this a volunteer firefighter. How does the Dexcom stand up to sweat, and physical activity?

1oz4y8u,Please need some input,"Hi. I was diagnosed with type 2 last January so about 11 months ago. I was 360 pounds and my A1C was around 11.3. Since then I have been on a ketogenic diet. I eat lots of protein and veggies. I’ve experimented with “zero carb” breads and tortillas but don’t use them often. I will drink coke zeros couple times a week. No alcohol. No cheat days. 
I started working out. Whenever I play golf I walk (5 times a week). Also I started doing long fasts after reading Dr Fung.
Fast forward to today I weigh 220 pounds. I went from 40 percent body fat to 20 percent as per the InBody machine at my gym. 

I’m in best shape of my life. However lately I’ve noticed my fasting blood sugar is really high. This morning for example I woke up it was 350. Last night I made a keto chili. Every night after dinner I do 15 mins on my concept 2 rowing machine. This will make my BS drop but then over night will get really high. For the last couple months I’ve noticed that once my blood sugar goes high, it stays high, until I exercise at gym for an hour then it will drop.

Why is this happening? I am on metformin , glyburide, and I take a handful of vitamins. I can’t go to the dr yet as I started new job and my insurance won’t kick in till new year. Has this happened to anyone? I thought after I lost all this weight and fat, that things would improve. I am scared as most nights my blood sugar gets pretty high. As I’m writing this it’s at 190. I had dinner about 3 hours ago.

1oynff3,"3 month update: A1C dropped from 13.1 to 5.8, but I'm suffering","I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/s/8nJzSMSJrw) here 3 months ago about my doctor setting me an impossible goal for changing my A1C from 13.1 to 8 within the first month of my diagnosis. I didn't drop to an 8, but I did drop to a 9.6 and asked to be given more time to get it lower. I could not afford to see an endo so stuck with the same doctor.

My A1C is now 5.8. I learned through experimentation (edit to add: after the first month or so, during which everything spiked me easily) that I can basically eat any non-sugar carb in moderate amounts with no variation in the resulting spike. In fact, the food I eat doesn't really seem to affect anything at all, unless it's very sugary (which I discovered when I ordered Coke Zero and received a normal Coke). I've never had much of a sweet tooth so I haven't experimented much with sugar, but my regular diet with slightly reduced carbs and a bit more fiber has worked wonderfully. I know it's hard to believe, but I genuinely did eat pretty well before! I've also lost quite a bit of weight, around 15kg, and am no longer classed as overweight.

Unfortunately, while my doctor is thrilled and everyone says they're so glad I'm healthier, I am in the worst state I've been in for around five years, and no one other than my husband really cares. For context, I have severe chronic pain and barely move due to that pain. I also have C-PTSD and have flashbacks that can last for hours, sometimes days, putting me in fight-or-flight for a long time. It is these flashbacks that raise my blood sugar to ridiculous levels and the lack of movement from pain that keeps it there. After a flashback, my sugar does not come down for the rest of the day unless I do at least 30 minutes of (admittedly very light) exercise. I did exercise before this diagnosis, but I would ""cheese"" it by dedicating two or three days a week to long, intense exercise so my most severe pain would be restricted to those days and I could work at lower pain levels for the rest of the week. 

Now I have to walk or do light strength training once or twice a day to bring my blood sugar down after flashbacks. The resulting pain and lack of energy is severe. I am a freelancer (a regular scheduled job is hard with my disability) and used to outearn my husband. My income and credit score allowed me to take out a housing loan, which is why we own a house! I was so proud of myself for beating the odds that have plagued me for all my life and succeeding. But because of two extremely leisurely 30-minute walks a day, I have been in so much pain and have been so exhausted that I can no longer work efficiently. The meds I've tried for pain over the years severely worsen my depression and dissociation, also making it hard to work. Mental healthcare in this country is generally terrible for more complex cases if you're not able to afford expensive specialists. I have either lost or had to let go of 80% of my clients. I now earn less than my husband, which has made making loan repayments difficult. And the pain has, of course, made me extremely depressed.

I wish I had a happier update. I understand the risks associated with high blood sugar and I am so grateful to have my A1C down; on lucky days without flashbacks, my sugar levels are evenly low, staying at 4.5-5.5 (80-100) for most of the day and never exceeding 7.8 (140) after meals. But man, I'm exhausted. I really don't know what the future holds for me... but at least my blood sugar levels are in check!

1oy9kuc,In need of something,"I was pre for probably a decade. Metabolic syndrome and all that. I was officially diagnosed type 2 in August of 2023. 

Doc put me on Mounjaro right away. I lost my taste for sweets and eggs when I started taking it. In the first year, I lost 70lbs. It was great. After a year of no progress at the highest dose, I stopped taking it. I have gained 50lbs in the past six months. 

A new metabolic doc suggested that I start a low dose again to kick start weight loss. I did that a month ago. I still don’t want eggs, but my desire for sweets is insane. 

I rarely check my blood sugar- like every 4-5 months. 

I eat a ton of sweets and graze all day instead of eating actual meals. 

For a long time now, I have been lightheaded darn near constantly. It seems to get worse when I’m sitting for a period of time, such as driving or during church. Someone suggested I check my blood oxygen level at those times. 

So I ordered a wearable health monitor to see what’s going on. It seems as though my heart rate dips often during the day. I talked to my cardiologist, who doesn’t seem to think I have an issue, but has me wearing a medical 14-week monitor right now. 

I was curious earlier today and checked my blood sugar when I felt lightheaded. It wasn’t super high, maybe 178, but it got me thinking. How can I check two hours after a meal, if my meals never really stop (yay binge eating disorder)?

Wow. CGM is goood. I’m obsessed looking at the numbers non stop now. It takes data in real time via Bluetooth (using LinX CGM).

Thank god for the CGM or I wouldn’t have known. Doc said no sugar spike higher than 10 at any time. So technically I failed the brown rice experiment. The dark rye bread… almost failed. 

I don’t know if I should let it slide cuz my post meal numbers are all great or the spikes are telling me to reduce the amount I had. But I’m thankful the CGM showed me how my sugar responded to different food.

1oxnjak,Feeling frustrated with myself and family,"Hi everyone. It's 2am and i should be asleep but im feeling the need to vent.

 I've been having a rough time trying to eat better but i'm just mentally exhausted and depressed and ready to throw hands with family making this hard. I think I also talked about this before in a another post like...Last year? 

I either forget to take my diabetes medication or I just don't want to. I'm supposed to take jardiance but I already pee so much from an over active bladder and peeing so much from drinking water that im scared about overworking my kidneys more than I should. 

I'm also supposed to take glipizide before a meal but I simply forget or dont think about taking it and taking it after a meal makes my BS drop extremely fast. 

Now for the food...oh my flipping god, food. I feel guilty for not having more control over myself. It's been so hard lately to make myself make something healthy when I just will grab the deli ham and eat some slices or grab a can of soup and eat/drink from the can. I do make dinner for most of the nights for everyone (there's 5 of us living in one house)

 I have two family members who live with me who are also diabetic. You'd think this would make it easier but it's mostly the opposite...my sil cannot have artificial sweeteners otherwise they make her sick. I can't blame her she didn't ask for that. She does try to eat healthy too...and then wants Popeyes and im like ""nooooo don't tempt me toooo!"" 

Now for the other diabetic family member. My own husband....he is much worse. He won't drink water, he won't drink zero sugar drinks, he will drink juice, he won't eat brown rice or quinoa, he must have his white rice, he won't eat multigrain bread. He will eat sourdough though...I've tried to do the healthier alternatives and he HAS tried them but he hates them. And yet his numbers are fine (for now. Yay cool but fuuuuuck thats makes me jealous) i have done the whole just buy healthy stuff but for the most part, im the only one who winds up eating it or it goes bad. Im the only one who eats the vegetable leftovers...unless its canned grean (its nasty, i only eat fresh)  Only me and SiL will eat the vegetables. Kiddo too but I make him eat his.

I do wish to eat more cleanly and less processed foods because I want to help my gut, fatty liver and kidneys.  At the same time, we don't exactly have the finances and time to eat that cleanly. And lately I've been having sensory issues with touching stuff that leaves my fingers feeling slimy, powdery, dirty in general. I feel instant ick. I have to psych myself up to get through food prepping part. 


I'm frustrated because if the bad stuff exists in our house, then im prone to snack/drink some of it too. For soda, I water it down and add ice since its been getting too sweet and there are times I want a sweet drink. I did try to use the water flavor syrups but im trying to avoid artificial sweeteners too and the Stevia one leaves a nasty aftertaste and makes me feel thirstier. :( 

Things I have cut back on:

instant noodles. That went from once a week to once every two weeks and now I think once every three? Maybe four?? I think the last time I had any was early October/late September.

1ox7i0d,My dad's recent blood test has me scared for him,"My dad's blood report came back in and he's 56 years old.

His glucose is at 190mg/dL. His last two results back in 2023 and 2022 were 129mg/dL and 115mg/dL. His A1C is 10.4. The last two results were 7.0 and 6.8.

His BUN/Creatinine and LDL were kind of high too. 30 and 146. It have been related to being dehydrated and with the cholesterol, I'm going to do my best to help him lower his oily food intake.

I don't know what to do with the rest. I feel like he's been controlling what he eats, but clearly it isn't enough. Does anyone here see a dietician? I've always wanted him to create a strict diet plan. I know there's a plethora of information on this subreddit, but I'm also scared as much as I'm asking for help.

I've been reading some other threads and here are some things I've going to encourage/enforce my dad to do.

\- eliminate white rice and other carbs entirely and replace them with quinoa and other replacements

\- 30 minute walks after dinner. He works during other meals, so he isn't able to walk. 

\- Really focus on limiting simple carbs and replacing them with fruits, veggies, meat, fibers, etc.

\- My dad snacks throughout the day. It'll be stuff like nuts like peanuts. Is this good or bad for a diabetic?

1ox204z,Diagnosed today - question about blood testing,"Quick backstory - I've been overweight since childhood, avoided doctors as an adult specifically because I was afraid of being diagnosed as diabetic, finally went and got a bloodwork panel done yesterday and they called me back today with an Rx for Metformin and a meeting next week to go over specifics. 

Presuming the goal is getting my A1C number low enough and that I follow the usual guidelines for food and portions, what's the benefit of monitoring my blood sugar every time I eat something?",1763139540.0,19,17,diabetes_t2,diabetes
1owyq4j,100 lbs down today,"This morning the scale read 225. That's 100 lbs down from December 31, 2024, I recently passed my 46th birthday, I was 6'3"" and I weighed 325 lbs. I never imagined I could lose 100 lbs in 318 days. That's 0.314 lbs per day. 

On December 31, I went to the ER with a kidney stone I had been dealing with for about a week, and it became intolerable. After getting triaged, the ER doctor asked me, ""What medication are you taking to treat your diabetes?"" I responded, ""Treat my what now?"" And he said, ""Your blood glucose is 330. You have diabetes. You need to discuss this with your primary care physician."" So, at 46 I had to establish a primary care physician. 

My primary care physician (PCP) put me on metformin, and we tried to get Mounjaro. It took 5 weeks to navigate the prior authorization paperwork. I started taking Mounjaro February 7. I radically changed my diet as soon as I got home from the ER, and, over those 5 weeks, I managed to lose 7 lbs. My A1C started out at 10.2, and within 90 days it was at 6.2, and I had lost an additional 38 lbs. Putting me at 280, and the first time in nearly 30 years that I was under 300 lbs. 

I did 4 weeks on 2.5 mg and 4 weeks on 5 mg, then stayed on 7.5 for 16 weeks. I've been on 10 mg since July 25. When I started on 10 mg, I weighed 258 lbs. Today, 16 weeks later, I now weigh 225. 

For my diet, I started out by changing what I ate, and then, as I progressed month by month, week by week, I reduced how much I ate. Firstly, I only ate chicken breasts, romaine lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, tomatoes, cottage cheese, individually wrapped 1 oz cheeses. Initially, I ate as much of these as I wanted, but I only ate from these choices. After 5 weeks of this diet change, and starting Mounjaro, I began portion control. I began weighing what I was eating, not to control how much I ate, but to understand how much I ate. And upon starting Mounjaro, I immediately noticed my satiety was significantly improved, and my hunger was much more quickly abated. 

After 4 weeks on 2.5 mg, I shifted from measuring for data collection purposes to measuring and weighing for portion control. I began making my salads with 200 grams of lettuce, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and chicken breast, 2 tbsp of salad dressing, and some olives and capers. For breakfast I would eat either 2 boiled eggs or 150 grams of cottage cheese. I maintained this rigor for my 4 weeks on 5.0 mg. My goal was to eat 1,650 calories a day. 

When I started on 7.5 mg, I was about 3 months into my weight loss journey, and 2 months on Mounjaro. From the beginning of May and on, my diet was on lockdown. My new challenge was not limiting what I ate, but eating enough. on 7.5 mg, if I ate ""when I felt hungry"" I would barely eat 1,200 calories a day. 

In June, I started going to a CrossFit gym. I went a little less than once a week for the whole month of May. In July, I committed to once a week and to try for twice a week. I'd do Monday and then try for Thursday or Friday, depending on my recovery. I also started being concerned about my protein intake with my significantly reduced intake. So I started buying 30 gram protein drinks. For a month, I drank 1 a day, at breakfast, mixed with equal parts coffee. This became my sole breakfast over time. I'd just make the coffee, no cottage cheese, and drink my protein coffee. 

In July I tried to get into the gym twice a week for sure. I didn't quite make it to twice a week. In August I stepped up to committing to 2 times a week. You should be getting the pattern here. In September I tried for 2.5 a week, and in October I committed to going to classes 3 times a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday. 

This has been my journey. I am down 100 lbs. I weigh less today than I have since I graduated high school 30 years ago. I was 16 the last time my weight was this low. 

I hope to lose another 30 lbs. I want to get to 195 to see what that's like. I haven't seen what this looks like in my entire adult life. I feel better than I have in over a decade, and maybe 2 decades.

1owmh46,Metformin or Mounjaro?,"[31f, 209 lbs] On Oct 23rd i got some test results back and found out I have t2 diabetes. My A1C was 11.2 and blood sugar 445. I immediately went on metformin 2x a day and glipizide 1 a day. Also immediately changed my diet. No carbs or sugar. I had a meeting with a diabetic educator a few days ago and she was very happy with my progress. My average numbers the past week have been between 105-125. When I get below 90 I experience symptoms of ""lows"" (shaking, vision blur, dizzy, sweating). I eat candy or something and feel ok shortly after. Doc said it was normal for me right now. She told me to stop taking the glipizide and so now im only doing metformin 1000 mg total a day. She said eventually I can decide if I want to stay on that or change to mounjaro, that it is up to me. 
I have no idea?? Food is stressing me out so much. Im eating great. But the constant food noise in my mind is burning me out already. Im vegetarian and recycling the same handful of meals throughout the week.. they are delicious but I still crave things I can't have. Desperately.
Finger pricking is also getting so old lol. She gave me a free 10 day dexcom g7, and it has been informative to see how levels rise and fall. But the device has been wrong by about 20 points each time I double check with a finger prick test...

1owj5e1,"The body is not a machine to be forced. It is a living system that adapts, learns, and remembers.","Hi,  
  
Just want to share some personal experiences in this T2 diabetes journey.

I am 58 yrs old male. Got diagnosed T2 with HBA1C 7.4% 2 years ago. Through controlled diets, exercises (walk, yoga, mediation), rest and self stress management and without any medication from beginning until now, my A1C gradually dropped to 6.8% then 6.1% then 5.4% and currently 5.2% and stays steady for the past 10 months. But, it's not about the numbers, it's about the whole system reaching the level of healing, adapting and self regulating.

One of the keys I have found throughout my journey is that **our body has wonderful capabilities to recover and to heal if we give it time and right conditions**. We might have unknowingly overworked or even abused our body over a long period and then we forcefully and frantically try to reverse the course in such stressful way.

I’ve learnt that we need to listen to our body’s response little by little and patiently help it correcting and healing. It needs time to learn and to create new and good memories.

I know that medication might be helpful to stop the damages but medication is unlikely to heal or to help our body to recover, specifically with T2 and especially if we maintain the habit of destroying our body. The process of healing and recovering require the complete reprogramming of our internal system to find harmony, balance and rhythm again, which might take a long time. The more rush, the more stress, the more harm done as the body is not a computer you can reset instantly. It is a *biological memory system* that needs time.

To heal and to recover, we need:

* rhythm
* rest
* movement
* nourishment
* sunlight
* calmness
* consistency

And avoid:

* panic
* over-diet
* over-fasted
* over-exercised
* over-restricted
* punished ourselves
* got frustrated
* tried to “fix everything in 3 weeks”

And memory takes time:

* to rewrite
* to stabilise
* to trust new patterns
* to unlearn old stress responses

The body heals in ***slow waves***, **not violent jumps**.  


I know we have different life styles, circumstances, environments but we all are having the same things: we have time to eat, to rest, to walk, to exercise, even very little. In our modern life these days, our lives are too fast, we are too stressed, we are eating too much ultra processed foods, we are moving our bodies too little, we are staying inside too much, we are sitting down too long. Fortunately, **we can all change these little by little**.

**Recovery should be sustainable and enjoyable**. It should not be a burden or something we are so stressed over (such as we still want to eat that much cake, drink that much soda etc). If we relying on medication so that we can still harm our body then it will reach the inevitable consequence sooner. Instead, we can save medication for the later years when our body is old and run down, our muscles are no longer enough to absorb glucose, our pancreas is blunt and our insulin is so bad. In the meantime, we can always help our system to reprogram and to heal.

1owftfs,Prostate/Bladder issues and Kidney health,"Hello all! I am going to see my primary care provider tomorrow morning about my constant thirst and urination. My diabetes diagnosis was in March of this year and i was at a 6.6 but my symptoms started in the summer. When I started experiencing these symptoms I thought it was because my A1C was still high but I've had two subsequent tests done and have been at a 5.8 and a 5.6. From the middle of summer up to this day ive been peeing 10 to 15 times a day and drinking a ton of liquids. The sensation to pee creeps up on me after around 45 minutes and most of the time I pee a decent amount but sometimes its only a little.

Ive been trying to figure out what is causing this but im not sure. I have an appointment tomorrow and hope I can get some answers but feel like it might not happen. Ive looked online and saw a few potential causes of this issue.

1. Hyperinsulinemia: where the body creates too much insulin and cant use it since we are insulin resistant. Frequent thirst and urination are symptoms.

2. Diabetic prostate: where diabetes damages the prostate and can lead to frequent urination and UTIs, among other things.

3. Neuropathy of the Bladder: where neuropathy damages the bladder leading to excessive urination and always feeling like you didnt empty out your bladder after you pee.

4. Medication: I take Fluvoxamine 200mg daily and one effect is dry mouth, so maybe that's what's making me extra thirsty. I doubt this is the issue as I didnt have dry mouth before my diabetes started while on this medication.

It's one thing to just experience these bothersome symptoms by themselves but unfortunately, they can cause damage down the road. Im worried about these persistent symptoms damaging my kidneys. The frequent dehydration can eventually lead to kidney disease and i really dont want that. I had a creatinine test done a few weeks back and I believe they were at a 1.04 when they should be below a 1.02. Creatinine can indicate how well your kidneys function.

I dont know why I am feeling this way, ive tested my blood glucose a handful of times the last week and a half and they are in the normal range. I hope it isnt anything bad. Im only 29 and im worried these symptoms will stay with me forever. Are you guys familiar with any issues of the Bladder/Prostate or hyperinsulinemia and have you had kidney disease from diabetes?

1ow7tgl,"Looking for single source of relevant nutrient levels for ""all"" foods","I am trying to figure out (over analysis) the relevant nutrient levels of the various foods I eat. Specific use case at this time would be ""grains"", but later also would be other starches like potatoes, etc..

I am currently of the belief that I need (want?) to know ""Total carbs"", ""fiber"", ""sugar alcohols"", ""sugars"", ""glycemic index"", etc.. I am understanding that I can calculate ""net carbs"", which from what I can tell thus far is the most significant parameter.

This started with my having stumbled across (online) recommendations to eat hulled barley rather than rice\*\*\*. This source made a clear distinction between ""pearled barley"" and ""hulled barley"". This source made it appear the difference to be vast (between barley and rice as well as pearled and hulled barley). So I started substituting hulled barley for white rice. My wife asked my why I was doing that. So we went online (our phones at the dinner table) and started looking at numbers. Our initial hits indicated hulled barley to be WAY higher than white rice in carbohydrates, which puzzled me and caused me to dig slightly deeper at the time to find that, apparently, the numbers were for RAW rice and barley. And on and on and on it went to the point of me deciding I needed to create a spreadsheet to keep track and then be able to easily reference.

\*\*\*(OK, it was ""FED"" to me by the ""barley industry"", no doubt)

FAIL FAIL FAIL

Problem is that I can't find any SINGLE source for all of this information and when I start looking at a variety of sources offering only a portion of the relevant parameters I find that those parameters contained in both sources are significantly different. Therefore I don't know which of them to accept. Further compounding it is that some sources show the values for ""raw"", while not making it apparent, and other sources are showing for ""cooked"", while not making it apparent. There is a large difference between ""raw"" and ""cooked"" when it comes to grains. Who eats raw rice, anyway?

Have any of you out there found a single source that lists all these parameters and has them in ""raw"" for AND ""cooked""?

For grains, ""cooked"" is probably the only relevant form I would be eating. But other foods, like vegetables it would make total sense to eat raw and cooked so the values for raw and cooked would be relevant.

UPDATE: I found a site that at least has some potential, others might be interested. [https://glycemicindex.com/](https://glycemicindex.com/)

This is a site run by the University of Sydney. They have a database that has what looks to be a comprehensive listing of various food-stuffs with their Glycemic Index and Glycemic Loads. I've noticed a problem with it, though, which I'm trying to work through now.

I'm thinking that if I can get ""Glycemic Load"" for ingredients and don't need to stress over the actual carbs and sugars and fibers. My understanding is that ""Glycemic Load"" takes all of that into account and comes up with a number representing the overall impact on the amount of carbohydrates your body has to battle and how quickly.  A low GL (Glycemic Load"" indicates the foodstuff is one or the other or a combination of low carbs, low sugar, high fiber, etc.,. The higher the fiber is the lower/slower the sugars are released (something along those lines) or simply lower carbs means lower sugars to be dealt with, etc..",1763056280.0,0,7,diabetes_t2,diabetes

I still thought it was worth a try. I will be seeing a doc to get a script for a G7. Yes, I still do finger pricks to see if the morning reading is really low, or if I ended up sleeping on it. 

If you especially are on insulin, I recommend getting a CGM. (Provided you can afford it, and your insurance covers it.) 

From what I understand of the G7, you can calibrate it to a finger stick reading if the reading seems off. I like the graph, so I can figure out what is triggering the spikes. My other understanding with G7 is it can transmit to a fitbit. 

Anyhow, thank you for reading. Stay strong and healthy. ",1762909078.0,2,11,diabetes_t2,diabetes
1oupk8w,🩸 Fasting and Type 2 Diabetes — Does It Really Work Long Term?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been reading up on **Dr. Jason Fung’s work** around fasting and Type 2 diabetes, and I’m honestly intrigued. I’m currently **210 lbs**, diagnosed with **Type 2 diabetes**, and trying to lose weight while keeping my sugars in check.

From what I’ve gathered, fasting (whether intermittent fasting or longer windows like 16:8 / 18:6) can help **lower insulin resistance**, **reduce blood sugar**, and even push some people toward **remission**. But what I’m trying to understand is the *long game* —

* **Does fasting work long term?** Like, do people really maintain lower A1C and weight years later, or does it plateau or rebound once you stop fasting?
* **What are the effects of fasting over many years?** Does metabolism slow down, or does the body adapt well if you stick with a sustainable routine (say 16:8 most days)?
* **If you’ve done this yourself**, how did your fasting schedule evolve over time? Did you combine it with low-carb or keto, or just calorie restriction?

I’m hoping to hear from people who’ve tried fasting for 6+ months or even years — especially **those managing diabetes without medication** or reducing their meds along the way.

Any lessons learned, pitfalls, or advice for someone starting this journey?

Thanks in advance 🙏

1ou97no,How to deal with shame?,"TLDR: I’m only 27, diagnosed since 22. I don’t see a lot of people in my age group with this diagnosis. The Shame is overwhelming. 

I was diagnosed with t2 diabetes 5 years ago at only 22. I’ve struggled with my weight and PCOS since I was 15. Both of my parents and all grandparents were diabetic. 

I asked my endocrinologist, please tell me exactly what I did wrong. Her response simply was “we don’t know enough about diabetes to say a certainty. Being predisposed via genes, hormone imbalance, and a lifestyle impact. There could be 10 women, in this room who lived as you lived and look the same as you, but with different genetics would not get diabetes.” But I know when people hear type2 they assume I am an egregious consumer of food and sugar..

Ever since my diagnosis I’ve been so ashamed. Since then I’ve done everything right, lost weight (70lbs), brought my A1C down from a 10 to a 5.7, I’ve even carried a healthy baby and continue to lose weight with a managed A1C post pregnancy. 

I wish there was a place that I fit into where I don’t feel ashamed or out of place. There are not many type 2’s my age, it’s hard to find any relatable creators or content or type2 peers in general.

Have any of you felt the shame? What helps?

# So my brother’s 50, always been lean but strong — broad shoulders, muscular legs, never had a belly. A few months ago, I noticed his legs looking real thin. I asked if he’d seen a doctor. He used to drink 4 liters of Coke a day, plus a liter of fruit juice, greasy foods, white bread — his diet was terrible.



# Then he started urinating 4 times a night, foamy urine, mouth dry like sandpaper. I told him, “Let’s go to the doc.” His fasting glucose came back 13.1, so the doctor ordered full labs. My brother immediately went cold turkey — quit all the junk, started drinking only water and lime. His urine cleared up, the foam went away, the thirst stopped. But the damage was done.



# Lab results:



# HbA1c: 14.1



# ALT: 69



# Cholesterol: 5.8



# Doc put him on Metformin 500mg twice a day, a blood pressure pill, baby aspirin, and statins (20mg). After 4 days on that combo, my brother was exhausted — barely talking, no appetite, legs cramping, no energy. We saw another doctor who said to stop the statin — 20mg was too strong for a body already drained from rapid weight loss and no carbs. He also said the blood pressure meds were unnecessary since my bro doesn’t even have high blood pressure — it was just drying him out and depleting electrolytes.



# A day after stopping those meds, he perked up again — started eating and feeling alive.



# Now, here’s the problem: he’s still losing weight, even though he’s eating healthy. Doc said to cut the low GI brown bread, but I can’t — if I do, he’ll waste away. He’s hungry all the time. His glucose is still up — fasting around 13, 11, 10, and after meals 8.2 or 9. Doc says insulin could drop him too low because his post-meal readings aren’t that bad, but I’m scared we’re just watching him fade slowly.



# Please, if you’ve gone through this — or helped someone get their strength back — I need some hope or guidance. I just want him to gain healthy weight again and get his energy back.

1otywat,Weight loss and type 2 diabetes,"Hello all. I've started my weight loss journey a couple of weeks ago. I weighed 300 pounds then and also started Metformin 500mg daily to help my blood sugar even though my numbers are in range.

1oth3u2,Best option for weight loss,"I was diagnosed with T2 diabetes about 10 years ago. Over the past 2 years I have lost over 150 pounds. I still want to drop 40 more pounds to get to my target. I have been watching my diet carefully and exercising 4-5 hours in a typical week. Over the last 4 months my doctor has weaned me off meds as my A1C was 4.6% and 4.5% on my last two visits. He started by having me stop taking Jardiance.  Then on my last visit about 2 weeks ago he had me stop taking Metformin and Victoza. Right now I'm taking no meds for diabetes.  I am on a CGM to monitor the results. From a blood sugar perspective everything appears to be good, except it does seem to take longer that normal for my blood sugar to come back down after a meal.

The only problem is that my weight loss has stalled.  Right after stopping all meds my weight went up by about 4 pounds.  I think that was primarily due to a change in how my body's digestive functions were working. Now, despite the intense workouts and highly limited low carb meals, I'm not losing weight like I once was. (I'd typically lose 3-5 pounds in a typical week. In the last 2 weeks now I'm up 3 pounds.)

I go back to the doctor in about 3 weeks. At that visit I'd like to talk to him about adding back one of my prescription meds to help resume my weight loss. Of the 3 meds I have taken--Metformin, Victoza, and Jardiance--which one would be the best one to resume from a weight loss perspective? I will talk to my doctor before resuming, but I think if I advocated for one in particular he would likely approve.

At my last appointment (new doctor, the one that prescribed to me left the practice) I asked about going up in dose (5mg) as my diet is currently very limited for keeping good blood sugar control. I said I would like to be able to eat a greater variety of foods outside of basically just chicken and green veggies. I was told that the medicine doesn’t work that way and increasing dose wouldn’t work. And then told not to lose any more weight (yeah, it would help if I could eat more foods 🙄).

1orrrbp,Low Heart Rate Metformin,"So I started on metformin 500 mg ER about a week ago. No GI side effects and honestly felt really good the first days - like my body was finally getting energy. However as the week went on my resting heart rate - normally 60-68 bpm lowered eventually reaching 53 beats per day and I started feeling like I was going to pass out. Blood glucose and pressure were fine, eating didn’t help, electrolytes helped a little but not a lot. Also although I felt better, blood glucose higher on metformin than not, tracked by CGM. Spoke to a pharmacist and he said to stop the medication which I did and 24 hours later resting heart rate is back up to 60 and I no longer feel faint. 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I’m a bit bummed out as I was excited to feel better those first few days. It seems to be a weird reaction to have higher blood glucose and lower resting heart rate. ",1762614613.0,2,9,diabetes_t2,diabetes
1orn80x,"HA1C from 10.2 to 5.7 in 3 month, but...","I was able to drop my HA1C from 10.2 to 5.7 since I received my diagnosis 3 months ago, by changing my diet and adding some exercise. (No meds.) I'm down 40 lbs, and I feel great aside from getting lightheaded sometimes when I stand up, and my hands tingling if I lay on an arm or too long. 

I went for my blood draw yesterday around noon and hadn't eaten since 6pm the evening before (needed to be fasted.) I did a finger prick right before I walked in and it showed 91. Which is a new low for me, I've been hovering around 100. But the glucose level that came back from my bloodwork ended up being 69, so that's a frustrating difference, and also annoying because I've spent the past 3 months working to lower my fasting glucose, and now it reads too low? 

Some of my other numbers are high now. In those 3 months my LDL went from 109 to 148 (normal range is 0-130.) My diet pretty much consists of eggs, chicken, turkey, pork, salads, and lots of cheese and nuts. I'll also have a slice of ezekiel with avocado or peanut butter (just peanuts) a few times a week, and an occasional whey protein shake with unsweetened almond milk. So I'm thinking it might be the excessive cheese and nuts, maybe along with the pork? I'd really love any thoughts about this as I try to map out what my diet looks like for the next 3 months to lower my LDL. (If it helps, total cholesterol is 191 with a normal range being <=200. Triglycerides are 56 and HDL is 32, both within normal ranges.)

The other one that is high is Anion Gap at 17.2 (normal range 6-15.) I looked into this one and it seems it could be high because my body was fasted and I'm ketosis, which I think is actually a good thing... should I worry about this one? 

Edit to add: I've also been eating a lot of beef sticks/turkey sticks. I don't want to leave that out as it may be contributing to my high LDL.",1762601654.0,37,20,diabetes_t2,diabetes

1orb4rc,I am thankful to work with people who care.,"I work at an auto parts store. I have been managing my diabetes for a good chunk of time. I got into a serious car wreck back at the end of August, because my blood sugar crashed too low, I passed out, hit another vehicle, rolled my car and woke up in an ambulance. My BS was 25 in the ambulance. 

My insulin doses were adjusted down, and moved from NPH insulin to a shorter acting because the NPH stayed around too long. 

Fast forward to yesterday. I was at my work station, and my BS crashed, and the folks I work with noticed that I was “off”. They had no clue what was wrong, just that I wasn’t my usual self. I didn’t realize that I was critically low. It was just before lunch. The one fellow was just about to call an ambulance. He offered me a candy of some type and while I wasn’t much better, I was starting to come out of my fugue. The other dude told me today that he thought I might have been having a stroke. He led me to the break room to have my lunch. I came back to normal after lunch. 

These dudes are good solid folks, and I am grateful to work with folks who pay attention enough to know that something is not right with me. I thanked them profusely today for being good folks, and for looking out for me. 

I did also point out that if I am acting off again, to remind me of the juice boxes I always have with me. When I am like that I really don’t realize it, and probably need to be reminded to check my sugar and drink a juice box if it is too low.

1or3hkj,Pharmacies,"I was just reading another post here and the OP related some issues they had with CVS and Walmart. One in particular, was a 2 day delay in getting a prescription switched from one to the another. As one didn't have what they needed. Reminded me of an experience I had.

I spent most my life living in Southern California. Lived in Manhattan for some years. Always hated pharmacies. Big chains rule in places like that. Since moving to a very small town in Ohio. You notice little differences that end up becoming HUGE differences. 

There is a CVS on the corner right across the street from a locally owned pharmacy. Couldnt be in more direct competition with each other if they tried. After my ICU stay for DKA. I had my prescriptions sent to the local pharmacy. Got there, tried to use my HSA card and it wouldn't work on their machine.  Walked across the street switched the prescription and card still didn't work. Ugh.

I start making phone calls. Next thing, im getting a call from the local pharmacy. Instead of letting me just go. They had been in the phone trying figure out from their end what might have been wrong. They actually told me what to do to fix the issue. Of course I went back to them. For about 6 months despite every prescription I have written to the local place. Somehow CVS still got it first and I have to have to switched. Even after going into CVS twice to tell them to never fill my prescriptions. I dont even know how they call it ""FILLED"" if I never picked it up. 

This pharmacist goes above and beyond for me every time I walk in the door. They literally have two 10 ft rows of product to sell. Not one soda or bag of chips. No candy. Although they do sell locally harvested raw honey. Just prescription drugs and useful medical products. If you need something from one of those shelves. They walk out and grab it for you, if you missed it. If they dont carry it and you actually use it a lot. They'll carry it for you. 

Long-winded way to say. Give the small guy a shot. They just might knock your socks off. They dont let me have issues with my meds. They take that on, or at least give me good advise on how to get it down. We all know how important meds can be to us and the little guy took away my huge worries.

My question: my doctor has advised taking Glucophage (Metformin).

I’ve been put on 5mg of Farxiga (dapagliflozin) the last month or so and have been keeping myself active between my walking commute and my post-dinner walks (aka my hot girl walks). 

I cut down carbs as much as possible, granted my dietitian told me 20g or less for main meals and managed to lose about 20 pounds in about 3 months. Admittingly, being put on medication had allowed me to be a little more lenient with myself but I still watch carbs and sugar intake. 

I’ve learned from both my doctor and dietitian that restricting myself from foods that I love is not the answer. Allowing myself to have things I love like ramen every blue moon is ok, and this has helped my mental health so much. 

When I was first diagnosed I was having constant mental breakdowns. I felt like I couldn’t handle this diagnosis, despite being told a 7.6 isn’t horrible. But knowing how far I’ve come in such a short time, makes me think I can really do this for the long run. It’s not going to be all positive, and as my dietitian told me, it’s a marathon, not a sprint.

After the walk I had 2 handfuls of Costco trail mix which maybe had 4 m&ms total. 

I noticed the longer rise last night before bed which never happens so I chugged about a liter or water and decided to do another workout (squats, sit ups and push ups) before bed in the hopes of dropping it and it just made it go above 12. 

I know this happens depending what you eat before bed especially but I thought I did it all right. I took my meds with dinner (1000 mg metformin) and worked out with a fairly balanced meal im familiar with.

Long story short, he was on Januvia for 6 years - suddenly had some all over body itching as a result of low kidney function due to the medication. His doctor took him off the Januvia suddenly. Just like that, after 6 years, stopped taking it. Hasn’t replaced the medication with anything else. This was about 4 weeks ago. Since then he’s been suffering from blurry vision, light headedness, low appetite, feeling “off balance”, and just not himself. He went to the ER last week.. they did a CT, blood work, etc.. all the things that came back normal. We say one of his PCP’s partners today and she thought he might have positional vertigo. We were able to do a same day with a physical therapist who after doing a few maneuvers said it is not vertigo. His blood sugars are testing back in range. They fluctuate but nothing out of what is considered ordinary.  

Has anyone else stopped Januvia suddenly and have had similar experiences with symptoms? What did you do? When did it subside? We are starting to wonder if his body just needs some time to regulate and get back to normal. We’ve done all the things and have found out a lot about what isn’t wrong with him… but it’s easy to see he’s frustrated and anxious.

1op3v62,Can A1C drop too fast?,"So I was diagnosed with T2 about a month ago with a 11.4% A1C and ~260-290 fasting BG. Doc put me on 250mg of Metformin twice daily and I cut out most carbs. After 35 days I went for a follow up and my A1C was down to 8.4% and my 28-day rolling average fasting BG is 112 (test every morning and chart in excel). 


Is a sharp drop like this normal? Safe? Those who have experienced a similar drop or trend - is there anything I should know or be prepared for?  Doc was ecstatic with the results so I figure I’m on the right track but google tells me a rapid drop may not be safe…

I've recently been diagnosed with diabetes. They think it's type 2, but this is very new and they've not completed the tests. I went for a blood test and had a Hba1c score of 93 (which i know is very high). 

I was prescribed insulin and metformin, but I'm reluctant to take the insulin. I'm 26M and honestly coming to terms with the whole thing, and it's causing me to not want to take insulin. The other reason I mention my age is that I've wanted to get into good shape for years (I've been 125kg + since I've been about 20). I'm also pretty comfortable with a strict diet. 

I've been reading up and I want to start intermittent fasting and going on a low carb diet <130g, made up of fruit, veg and milk, and increase my exercise (I go to the gym twice a week anyway). I have an appointment with the doctor in 4 weeks time, but I'm sort of spiraling and questioning everything I'm eating at the minute and feeling pressure over not taking the insulin. My doctor also kind of just prescribed the medication and told me she'll set me up with a dietician, but there's a waiting list there. I'm also questioning that diet/exercise regime over the fear of low blood sugars and I suppose I've just lost my confidence entirely over this. 

I'm also trying to balance a masters degree and a 30 hour per week part time job, and it's been tough to manage everything. 

I suppose I'm just hoping that if i limit my carbs and keep moving, I'll be alright. Is this too naive? Do any of you guys have any advice for this?

1oo72jk,I need help - nothing seems to make a difference.,"Hi all. I'm based in the UK and got diagnosed with t2 diabetes around 2 years ago. I got put on metformin which over a few months was increased to 2000mg a day taken in two doses (1000mg with breakfast and 1000mg with the dinner). Since the diagnosis, I've cut out sugar, lowered carbs, cut back on alcohol, increased exercise, but nothing seems to work and I've gained 25kg over 2 years.

I'm testing my blood sugar levels, and even first thing in the morning, it's barely below 12mmol/l and fluctuates between 8 - 14mmol/l during the day (my job is quite active at times, so I'd assume that's why it fluctuates). I feel like I'm following all the guidance, but my health is getting worse and I'm struggling to enjoy life because of the effects it's having. 

I've got an appointment with the doctor at the end of the month, but I'm expecting to be shrugged off like I was last time I mentioned it (back in March). To be honest, I'm really tempted to stop my medication as I generally felt healthier before all this started.

1oo6yaq,Eat the damn cake,"Just over 3 months since my T2 diagnosis (A1C 9.6% - brought down to 5.7% with 1000mg Metformin XR, big diet changes).

I think it’s kind of expected that you’re going to immediately spiral when you get the news, and depending on your personal history with food, you might go one of two ways: denial or militant discipline. I went (sort of) the latter: cut out 90% of carbs, freaked about everything, every little spike, walked after every meal, ate less. Probably all good things, but upon reflection I think I developed a bit of an eating disorder in the process. “I can’t eat that.” “Oh no I’ve ruined everything I just hit an 11 on the CGM.” “I’ll never eat bread ever again.” “No I can’t eat potato’s.” 

I picked up on these behaviours and decisions eventually, and have updated my language to “I can eat that but the consequence will probably be a sharp spike in my blood sugar” and “one spike isn’t going to undo 3 months of better eating habits ” and “your whole lifestyle is more important than the occasional indulgence.” 

Here’s the thing - the discipline worked. To go back down to non-diabetic A1C level was really encouraging. Maybe I would’ve got there even with a little less strictness. But all the same, as imperfect as the journey was, I achieved my goal. 

I wish it meant diabetes was gone and I could go back to devouring a whole packet of biscuits or an entire pizza. And you know what, I probably could do that for day and I wouldn’t do irreversible damage, but after freeing myself from my binge eating habit, I now ask myself “yeah but why do I wanna do that?“

Anyway, I am on holiday at the moment and bought a tiramisu for lunch. No high fibre side salad. No high protein starter. Straight up sweet, fat, lactose filled tiramisu. And my CGM reading? Barely a blip. (My bank account however…Harrods in London is not for the weak.)

Came off Metformin for 3 days and I've been feeling so much better with no pain. Took 1 tablet yesterday (with evening meal) nd chest pains are back.

Told Dr this today and I was appalled by her attitude. She actually said, and I quote: ""what do you want me to do for you? What is the outcome you want? I know what to do but what do you want me to do?!""

She basically wants a stool sample to test for any GI infections (despite all symptoms leaving me after I stopped tablets)

Are there good devices out there that use generic strips (if those exist) or strips available from multiple sources?  I'm highly resistant to being held hostage by companies using proprietary parts and refuse to give my money to them as I view it as unethical because they inevitably come out with a new proprietary part to avoid competing with generic manufacturers.

What price point should I be looking at in Canadian dollars (CAD = $0.71 to $1USD)?

1ok2ikd,Type 2 diabetes symptoms question,"Hello everyone I had a type 2 diabetes question.  So in March of this year I became diabetic as I had an A1c of 6.6 and was 320 pounds (145 kg). In a few months I was able to lose about 30 pounds (13.6 kg) with the help of diet and exercise as well as weight loss medications phentermine and toperimate. I only stayed on those pills for a couple months as I believed they gave me bad symptoms but those symptoms I think was the diabetes starting up. I slowly started experiencing frequent urinarion, frequent thirst, fatigue, weight loss, and pins and needles sensation in my feet. These symptoms started early summer.

I had a follow up A1c test done in July and was at a 5.8. I was happy about this. However, my diabetes symptoms started being a daily occurrence mid August. I sort of took my foot of the gas between July and this Monday. I didnt work out as much and didnt eat as strictly but was still doing ok. I also started using cannabis daily between mid August and this Monday.

I then had another A1c test done this Monday and was at a 5.6. I was shocked. How did my A1c drop 0.2 when I wasn't focused on my diet and exercise as much? During all of this time my diabetes symptoms persisted and I was frustrated. These symptoms are affecting my daily life. It gets tiring drinking a ton of water a day and peeing like 12 times a day. I was thinking maybe starting a diabetes medication would help me with my symptoms so I just started Metformin (500mg daily) a couple days ago. Im also planning on losing some weight and eating healthier. Im currently at 300 pounds. I see my doctor again in March of next year.

My question is this: why am I still experiencing diabetes symptoms while my A1c is in normal range? I understand that my diabetes will be a chronic problem but I thought my symptoms would be alleviated when I dropped my A1c below a 6.5.

What are your guy's thoughts on this? I was thinking maybe I became insulin resistant and that's why I drink a lot and pee a lot. Im thinking I should get an insulin resistance test from my doctor to see what my levels are at. Im also wondering if i would need insulin if I have high insulin resistance. I also stopped using cannabis as it might not mix well with my Metformin. 

Thank you guys for reading this. I would just like my symptoms to be reduced and wanted to know if someone was dealing with the same issue as me.

P.S. I also read online that losing quite a bit of weight can help reduce symptoms. Is that true?

HOWEVER, after the 3 months of lower carb eating, I went back to the same normal carb and sugar diet and just added strength training, lost and gained 15 kilos over the last 3 years from binge eating (and recently just lost it again) and yet despite all of the ups and downs my hba1c stayed in between the 5.6 and 5.8. I haven't taken metformin or any other medication during the last 3 years.

My doctors think im just being humble when I tell them my diet has barely changed but Im confused because it seems that my body shouldnt be randomly responding to sugars almost normally after only 3 months worth of strict dieting. 
I have no idea what couldve possibly made my sugars so high those two times in 2022 I've been tested, could I have just successfully reversed it in time? Was it just pre-diabetes after all? Could it Be another type of diabetes like MODY?

TLDR: Had a diabetes diagnosis with a hba1c of 6.7 but reversed it in seemingly 3 months and maintained a hba1c between 5.6-5.8 despite eating normal and sometimes large amounts of carbs/sugars, confused on whether I had diabetes or not",1761635490.0,4,16,diabetes_t2,diabetes

My dad was a heavy drinker his whole life and quite an alcoholic for the past few years. 

He got diagnosed with Diabetes type II one year ago and has tried to change his diet recently after the doc said his drinking was compromising his health / results. 

He tried to cut from many glasses a night to “only” 2. I know that a lot of people would tell him to just cut it but honestly I’m appreciative of his effort to actually listen to the doctor. 

His results were 150 3 months ago and now it’s still the same despite 2 months of change. 

Is this solely because of the alcohol? Could it be something else? Does it take time for the measure to change?

Finally decided to make some changes.  I read *The Diabetes Code* and *The Obesity Code* by Dr. Jason Fung.  Started eating very low carb, doing 16:8 IF with 48-hour fasts once per week.  Stopped Jardiance at the beginning, as its incompatible with a very low carb diet and with fasting, due to substantial risks of euglycemic ketoacidosis.  

In three weeks I have discontinued glimepiride altogether and am only taking metformin.  I had reduced my glimepiride but was still having to eat glucose tablets or peanut butter every day to keep from going hypo so I stopped altogether.  All of the glimepiride is now out of my system and my daily averages are around 100.  I'm keeping track of all glucose readings, blood pressure, body weight, and food in a spreadsheet.  I'm averaging \~1200 calories per day with 16 grams of carbs (5% of total calories).

I just said it was after a OGTT test came back positive and the reason for the OGTT test was to test for reactive hypoglycemia.

I do get high BG spikes but also have and still get some serious lows which she picked out of the CGM data. She does feel that whatever is complex enough to take me on as a patient and help out. She did mention that there can be secondary issues that cause the BG swings which they will try and figure out the cause over the next month or so. she did not take me off the mealtime insulin but reduced my I:C ratio to 1:20 until i get into to see the Endo MD.

Are we not supposed to wear flexible sole shoes? Does it cause more issues? Most of the diabetic feet shoes I see in store/online are very bendable and very flexible. 

I had one doctor tell me I need to wear super comfortable protective shoes - soft step, memory foam-like, stretchy slip-on, rubber sole. Then another doctor said I need to focus more on arch support and width without the shoe being super flexible or my feet will feel all hard surfaces and be sore.

After multiple toes bruising incident from steel toe boots and being diagnosed with T2 in the same week (four months ago), I bought a pair of these house shoes. Yes they are soft and expanding wide toe box but lately I have been wondering if my feet are always feeling so easily tired and swollen from wearing work shoes and sneakers because my feet are so used to these shoes at home. 

Also, could the rubber soles on these shoes really not be beneficial to my diabetic feet? Because they are also fleece/cotton structure, my feet do slide around inside them sometimes. I put in a Dr. Scholl's insole but I still don't dash or quick step in them they are sort of that clog shape where you shouldn't.

I had been ""Pre-diabetic"" for about 4-5 years already, and definetly let some lifestyle choices slip last year as my wife was pregnant, and have obviously passed over the threshold.  I'm not surprised, but am disappointed that I let it get to this point.

I've been prescribed Metformin which seems very common as I scanned a few posts on here.  I've been working on losing the ""baby weight"" already this year (15lbs and counting) so my doctor and I think I'm already on a good path excercising, but will obviously make some additional changes on the diet side.

This Metformin is the first long-term prescribed drug I've had in my life, so my main advice seeking is how everyone handles this.  I've been prescribed two pills a day, and have been told to take with food.  I typically skip breakfast, so I'll have to get back into that habit - any advice on quick breakfasts that I can mostly grab-and-go?  Does anyone skip breakfast and still take Metformin?  I've gotten queasy taking pain meds on an empty stomach, so I'm going to take these with breakfast for at least the first couple weeks.  I did see some spots that say the Metformin has increased efficacy if taken 30min before a meal, but the vast majority still says take with/after eating.  Regardless, I'm going to wait a while and do plenty more research before tinkering with any timing.

I travel 4-5 days a month for work.  I don't feel like schlepping my huge 90-day pill bottle across the country - are there any good products for dividing out pills?  My initial thought was dumping a dozen pills into a film cartridge and throwing it into my toiletry bag, but I'm open to more elegant suggestions.

The beginning of this year I stopped Metformin because the combo was too much for my stomach and Mounjaro alone keeps my blood sugar ok it seems.  Last A1C was 5.4.  But I now fluctuate between 182 and 185 lbs no matter what I do.  My face and arms have stayed the same with the weight loss but my stomach and hips is where I can tell the difference.  Last year at this time when I look at video and pics my hips and butt were small!  Now I can tell the difference in my pants where I’m more curvy.   Granted I’m nowhere near where I once was at 250.  I just would like to get to 160.  Ideally 140 but not sure that’s possible.  Haven’t been in the 140’s since my 20’s.  ",1761222728.0,4,6,diabetes_t2,diabetes

And to add to that I went and bought the best dairy vanilla ice cream available in my area. And a bag of blueberries.

Then I put butter in a pan, cut a slice of bread pudding and cooked each side in the butter, then added the blueberries and then placed it on a plate with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

1odocns,Just wanted to share good news: had my A1C check today: 6.8% 🥹,"1/ yes, I know, there's room for improvement. That's always going to be true. I'm okay with being a work in progress. :)
2/ I started off 14++ earlier this year and my PCP stressed the need for a gentle slope of reduction in sugars so complications wouldn't plague me as much. 
3/ I started off with metformin but had an intolerance to it so moved to Jairdiance + glipizide.
4/ Physical activity? Walking when the weather/timing allows for it, otherwise the stationary bike is my bae. Usually 5-12 miles a day, usually around 8 is my aim as I'm recovering from a major surgery. 
5/ Foods? I cut out added sugars, limit carbs, I take responsibility for curating what I eat. I'm not perfect but it's a genuine effort. 
6/ Cheat meals? I think that's the wrong way to look at it. The diet isn't a punishment. I want to live. However, I will have things that I genuinely take pleasure in eating when I can, but the trick is you must be mindful of portion and probably go under the recommendation. Snacks are fine, but know what you can eat. Cater to YOUR metabolism.
7/ I can't afford a CGM and I don't stick myself like crazy because that's not sustainable, but I do log at least twice a day and if I feel off for any reason. Every few weeks, I'll do a more detailed log for a normal day. 
8/ I've lost some weight too. Still on the fledgling part of that journey because I've been overweight most of my life and I have other factors that add to metabolic dysfunction. However, I've built some muscle finally (leg days are great) which does weigh more than fat and while I've been losing fat, I'm finally showing it on the scale.
9/ The medical emergency with my gallbladder removal kinda killed my appetite (violently throwing up for 5 days will do that) and the weight loss there was deceptive because I couldn't drink or eat and I was dangerously dehydrated for the duration. I feel like today's numbers better reflected my losses because it's not based on crisis numbers. 
10/ Bad days happen. Feel your feelings. Be mad. Cry if you need to. Do the work. Small changes will have an impact. This number is a result of 7-8 months of work, bringing my A1C down at least 7-8 points (I started off as 14++, literally off the charts, I was living with dangerous numbers which hadn't obviously impacted me at that point so it wasn't for very long. It's suspected inflammation from COVID was the trigger point, but that's difficult to confirm). 

I know I've posted on here about bad days. My last post was me whining about my A1C check coming up and me not even wanting to know because this last month has been hell with the surgery and my erratic numbers because of how the gall bladder messing up and then removal messes with insulin resistance. I was depressed and just exhausted. So to have such an encouraging number despite that??? I feel validated in the best way.

1odmhzl,How long does the GLP-1 honeymoon last?,"I posted something about my experience as a type 2 diabetic on Wegovy a couple of days ago. I just got my c-peptide and fasting insulin test back and am astounded at how much better everything is. My c-peptide dropped from 4.55 to 3.34 and my fasting insulin dropped from 23.4 to 9 after 3 months on Wegovy. If ChatGPT is to be believed, my HOMA-IR dropped from 5.1 to 1.9, which seems wild to me.

My question to people who have been on various GLP-1s is whether it’s easy to maintain these kinds of numbers. Does time take its toll and things start creeping up again despite maintaining a good exercise regimen and a low(ish) carb diet or have things stayed the same for you over time?

I’m not putting my eggs in one basket, but I’m kind of blown away at the numbers right now. Obviously, I’m not thinking I’m cured, but I’d love to shove the anxiety about organ damage, blindness, and amputation farther back into my lizard brain.

1odladx,Routine Struggles,"I’ve been so flaky with friends recently, and I really need to fix this.

Since my diagnosis in March 2024 where I found 13.4 A1C, I have fortunately maintained sub 6.5 A1C with lifestyle and 500 mg Metformin twice daily. I have found that running or swimming for ~30 minutes in the mornings before work about 30 minutes after breakfast has been a huge boon to my blood sugar throughout the day. With meal prepping lunches a few days at a time and breakfast/coffee the night before while I make dinner, I still find myself needing to wake up 3 hours or 2.5 hours before my shift begins, whether leaving from mine or my partner’s place, in order to consistently be on time for work. I find I have about 4.5 hours after commuting from work before I should be winding down for bed, during which I can have chores, an errand, and time I need to spend exorcising more in order to maintain blood sugar I am comfortable with. 

Today, I was going to meet up with a good friend for a shared hobby. This is already at some cost to my routine, typically some of it being my sleep (which I’d really like at least 7 hours of) and some after work exorcise. My manager approached me at work today letting me know that I’ll need to be in a couple hours early to cover a work task. I let my friend know this, and asked if we could try rescheduling for Friday. They were rightfully upset. This isn’t the first time I’ve recently flaked due to what feels like any unexpected change to a schedule made more demanding by diabetes.

I realize this isn’t specifically a diabetes problem, but it feels like this issue has been exacerbated in my life since my diagnosis and the measures needed to take care of myself. How have y’all managed packing your diabetes routines into your schedules? Are there any tips or hacks y’all have made, allowing for stronger commitments to the things you enjoy in your lives?",1761168941.0,1,2,diabetes_t2,diabetes
1odjxqk,What can I eat with this blood sugar?,"I am newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 weeks ago. My A1C was 9.4 (up from 6.8 in January). My fasting blood sugar that day was 248. I was really surprised by that because I had made good lifestyle changes. I had fasted for more than 12 hours and I had had a late meal before that that did not include any added sugars or bread or pasta. 

I have not been checking my blood sugar because they said that is not necessarily something that you need to do unless you take insulin. I did buy a monitor just to satisfy my curiosity and know what I actually have going on. I had gestational diabetes so I know how to use it. I had not used it yet, but today I've been feeling so sick... I took my blood sugar 2.5 hours after I ate and it was 333. I wonder if that is what made me feel crummy because that's the highest I've ever seen it. An hour after that, it was 328. I can't seem to get it below 300. I drink water and I did exercise like my diabetic educator told me to do if I ever found myself having a high number. 
I still feel very sick, and I'm not sure if it has anything to do with the blood sugar or not but I am also very hungry, but I'm actually scared to eat because Google is telling me that 300+ is pretty bad.
I'm sorry if this seems like a stupid question, but what should I be eating? I can't just not eat, but I am afraid to eat because I feel like I don't want to spike my sugar since it doesn't seem to be going down. Google has me thinking it is a major thing and also not a big deal at the same time, so I figured I would go on to Reddit and ask people who actually know this info first hand.

I just recently got diagnosed at the age of 28. I saw it coming with a long line of diabetics in my family tree. However, I never thought it would come this early. I have been struggling to find the right food choices and really appreciate my cgm.It has helped at lot! 

That said I always wake up with high numbers even around 150 sometimes as high as 170 and that's with a dosage increase. I have read about the dawn phenomenon but my numbers do not start to fall down until 2pm then it drops to around 105.

But, where I was fighthing to get a CGM on United Health Care (they wouldn't approve one UNTIL I had been on Insulin, which I am TRYING to avoid) I managed to get one zero cost on Medicaid!! Auto approval.  I am on day 3 ish? so far interesting results. Wish I had this sooner so I could have tracked my eating better.

I had success doing K\*\*O  years back.  My A1C went down, I lost weight and my mood and inflammation in my body improved.  BUT Pandemic happened, I went through Menopause etc stress.. so I struggled to get back to that kind of eating. .(I was eating a lot more vegetables mind you but the fat increased my saity a lot... and I was doing more Intermittent fasting as well.  )

Anyway,  so I got my CGM and it is giving me interesting readings.. I Had been on a dose of prednisone earlier this year that raised my A1C to 8 and my blood sugar levels were HIGH.  I was finally seeing better results that were in the 150s (vs the over 200 + consistant readings) . I have cut out more carbs and sugar but I am not perfect at it.  I go to the food bank they shove a 1/2 gallon of icecream at me.... uh ok.. frustrating. 

But the one thing I am finally able to see is the DAWN phenomena. OMG.. 250.....  

It is interesting though.. My alarm went off (and woke me up at 5am) to inform me I had a 250 reading.   At around 6, it went down to 225 and now it is back up to 255...  (Drinking black coffee with coconut oil and Acacia Fiber) and it went up..   

I probably will need to try and start with water.. lemon water or something..

but is there anything I can do to alleviate those high levels?  Not asking for medical advice, just wanting to change some things.   I did eat shortly before bed, so I will have to stop doing that.

Jan 2025: 7.1
June 2025: 5.3
October 2025: 5

I did put in a lot of hard work including a complete overhaul of my diet and obsessively tracking everything for the first couple of months after diagnosis. I was also exercising from 45-75 minutes per day before my second A1c test. While that is probably how I should be living my life, I found it to be a pretty huge mental load. I saw an endo at the end of June after my second A1c and asked her if she recommended anything to help increase my insulin sensitivity. She put me on Wegovy, which I started in mid July. 

I was super surprised to find my number so great, especially since I haven’t been exercising very regularly since I threw my back out due to bad side effects from a statin in July. I have been conscious about my diet, but nowhere near as obsessive as I was the first several months. In any case, Wegovy has been a game changer for me, even if it hasn’t caused me to lose much weight. I’m in it for the insulin sensitivity more than anything, and it has shown that it does its job in that regard! 

I’m not suggesting that people take meds, especially if they’re uncomfortable with them, but I have found it to be a game changer for me, although I am definitely getting back in the gym when I can!

1ob67eg,Grandpa is on no Diabetes medications but has T2 Diabetes! How do I explain to him that he needs to go back on it after his normal daily blood glucose readings?,"So my grandpa when it comes to his health is a pathological liar, so I never take him seriously. He lied about having a heart attack, and he's insistent he is no longer in CHF. Well, the other day he mentioned his blood glucose level was at 165 after fasting for over 8 hours. After we had a pasta heavy dish I had him take him blood glucose before bed and it was reading at 275. So I don't think it was 165. He also eats like a teenager.

I think my mother needs to assert her medical power of attorney over him due to the fact he is sundowning to request his next fasting blood glucose and A1C test. I know that he's at an elevated risk of kidney disease because of having diabetes, and he doesn't really drink much water and is chronically dehydrated. 

But how do I explain to him that he needs to drink more water and go back on his T2 diabetes medication? He thinks he was having issues with his T2 diabetes medication, but never thought to have his doctor adjust his blood pressure medications and have him drink more water because he also is on lasik.

I’m not asking for medical advice (just want to make that clear), just more or less curious how everyone goes about limiting their carbs. I’m seeing a new doctor after kind of losing my way a bit (I’ve had a traumatic few years and during that time I’ve stopped taking care of myself) and trying to really get a handle on things. My doctor suggested a limit of 50g per meal but that seems rather high?

I don’t eat meat, dairy or eggs so with my diet even my protein sources will have SOME carbs. I stay away from potatoes, rice, pasta, sweets, soda, and only on occasion have a small piece of fruit. Dinners are typically salads, “pastas” made with konjac noodles and veggies, etc. with protein being tofu, sometimes nuts, or a high protein/low carb vegan “meat”. I also skip a full breakfast (dawn phenomenon highs) and usually opt for just a sugar free latte with almond milk and maybe two tbsp of hemp seeds (1-2 g carbs with 10g protein)

I know everything is so individualized and all I can do is test things out. I’m thinking of trying to stay in a 25-40g per meal range and seeing how that goes.

the final straw was last fall when i was throwing up every 10 minutes or so. i stopped all medication and never felt better. metformin also started effecting my mental health. i had never ending brain fogs, haziness, dark thoughts and i started harming myself. when i stopped it, everything suddenly cleared up. i felt better mentally and physically for the first time in years. i started sleeping better (better for me, ive had insomnia since i was 2) and generally felt so so good.

then the doctor convinced me to go on jardiance and… it’s pretty much the same. i’m not running a continuous fever but i do run a high one (101.1) every night around 9 but it’s gone by morning. i’ve been dizzy for like six weeks. getting overheated. i haven’t slept since *monday* and just flat out feeling awful. the worst part is? none of the medication has ever worked for me. i think ive only had an a1c below 10 once despite diet and exercise. its so bad i dont even eat anymore for fear ill just throw it up bc i have.

Fast forward to 2020 I noticed he was losing a lot of weight. He told me he was doing the intermittent fasting (he worked nights). I asked him did he talk to his doctor - of course no (he thinks doctors are in business with Metformin). Make a long story short- I made him go to the doctor - his sugar was over 400 and he was put on insulin……. Today his sugar avg 240 (based on his visits to ER for vertigo.  He takes his insulin every other day and no longer uses Metformin, high blood pressure meds or statins. Oh he suffered from ED but got an implant for that.

1o8g0t9,Correlation between A1C and daily fasting Glucose measurement,"Asking those who honestly know.

I was diagnosed as ""T2 Diabetic"" based on an A1C blood test (followed up with a 2nd one) several weeks ago. I immediately stopped eating extraneous carbohydrates (no breads, no rice, limited legumes and beans, limited grains, no snacks, no candy or treats, etc..). Basically nearly a KETA diet. The key point being that I've been absolutely consistent since then. I've been taking daily fasting Glucose measurements (prick my finger, put blood on test strip in the little meter device). My daily fasting Glucose readings have are very clearly/obviously dropping, having gone from 133 to 113 (nine day averages).

Certainly my fasting glucose levels cannot continue to 0, else I would die (before that point). Correct?

My fasting blood glucose will have to settle out at one point or another. Assuming I am getting sufficient carbohydrates simply from what I am eating as I avoid any 'extra' carbs (as I described above) to remain healthy. Correct?

IF fasting blood glucose is truly representative of ONLY the past 8-12 hours, why would it not have gone to whatever that 'final' value is immediately?

Edit: Why do I ask this? I ask because my daily fasting glucose readings (blood drip on test strip) have been very clearly trending downwards over the course of two weeks (taken at the same time each morning when I get out of bed). My overall diet and exercise and sleep and such have been quite consistent throughout that period. Obviously (to me) the measurements cannot continue to trend downwards toward 0 (I wouldn't wake up).

2nd edit: I blasted through the first 100 test strips quickly as I exercised my curiosity. I was testing right before meals and then every 30 minutes after meals to see what I could see. My glucose level peaks approximately 1 hour after eating. Highest level was 190, once, but typically around 170. No significant difference between glucose 4 hours after dinner, 6 hours after dinner (I set alarm, woke up, and measured), and morning when I get up. My doctor believes if I continue with my current control measures I will be fine. So my question here is not a ""will I die"" question.

Even staying on the .5 I find that instead of my symptoms getting better overtime I seem to be getting worse. 

The nausea is horrible until about day six I have reflux beyond belief. I have loose stools and abdominal cramping off and on some weeks are better than others. I have tried to eat smaller meals. I’ve tried to watch what I eat, but it’s very difficult. I also find that I’m extremely fatigued because I’m not taking enough calories and that’s why I’m so tired and I’ve not lost any weight on it, but I was taking it primarily for blood sugar control which it was excellent at doing. 

I have come off of it. It’s been about three weeks and my blood sugars are rising slightly I was in the low to mid sixes sometimes in the high-fives and now I find my blood sugars are anywhere from 6.8 to 7.2 A1C6.3 and I expected the rise of blood sugars.  I was told to try Mounjaro  2.5 mg to see whether or not that would give me the same symptoms.

 I hope not worse so I wondered if anyone has been on Mounjaro did they find the symptoms worse and also did you start with half of the 2.5 ?

I have a qwick  pen by counting the clicks or did you start on the 2.5. 

I also wondered if anybody noticed that their blood sugar control was better and their numbers were lower?

1o82qe2,Struggling after starting metformin,"Hi guys,

It’s me again. I’m in need of people to talk to. So I was diagnosed in August: completely changed my diet and finally started metformin last week (I had to move home and a ton of other stuff). 

Ever since I started, I’ve had strange tingling in my feet and legs. I don’t know if it’s the medication or something going wrong, and I can’t get a GP appointment (UK). This morning, the soles of my feet feel weird and I feel a bit out of it. Has anyone had any non-GI side effects of metformin? 

I’m going to try and get an appointment as it went away for a while and now is back in full force, but I didn’t have it at all until starting the medication. I know I need to contact a medical expert, but was just hoping to talk to people about it.",1760611176.0,4,15,diabetes_t2,diabetes
1o80pbf,Feeling hungry even after eating for a newly diagnosed t2,"I was diagnosed with t2 last September 29. Since then I have looked at this subreddit for tips and you guys have been helpful for newly diagnosed people like me. 

My fasting blood sugar was around 160 and my HbA1c was 7.7. I was prescribed to take 500mg metformin + 30mg gliclazide at breakfast and at noon. Since then I have been trying to pick foods preferably low in refined carbs.   
  
Lately I have been trying a very low carb diet (approx 60 to 80g of carbs a day) with at least 90g of protein and some fats but I almost always find myself feeling hungry. At first I thought since I was diabetic, I might be having a low sugar episode. I used a fingertip-prick glucose monitor but the result was 90 mg/dl.

Am I technically starving myself if I feel this hungry? Should be eating more carbs?",1760603406.0,8,6,diabetes_t2,diabetes

1o7y9k9,A1C checkup next week but I'm backsliding due to major setback,"I need to vent. Maybe venting will help.

I had emergency surgery September 29 to get my gallbladder out. It would not be an exaggeratoon to say that the experience leading up to that was the worst in my life and had that surgery been more delayed, I may not have survived it. 

I'm having a good bit of post-op anxiety, pain, and lack of sleep. I feel like I've had a major setback because I'm barely eating and my glucose is back where it was months ago. I'm so stressed out and exhausted and I know all that plus taking pain meds can raise glucose levels and insulin resistance, not to mention the trauma itself can. My body is healing from a traumatic experience  and is having to acclimate to a new normal. 

And on top of that, I'm sick. Both a cold and a bacterial infection in my lungs from being on a vent during surgery. They were hoping it would have cleared up by itself but now I'm on antibiotics. A good thing but the class of drug I'm on can also raise blood sugar. I'm so tired of the coughing fits. I just want to heal and get back on track. 

I'm wondering if we should post pone the A1C test until December, give me a few more weeks to heal (one of my incisions is especially painful and often wakes me up, it's a placement thing) so I can stop taking various pain meds and get my sleep under control (it's usually less than 4 hours a night). 

I just feel like in the face of all this discomfort and stress, my meds aren't as effective because I'm not in a state that allows them to be. 

I have no energy (but I force myself to be on the stationary after meals for at least 8 miles). I'm exhausted but can't sleep. I feel like I have no control over my blood sugars because the exercise is not having the same effect they it was. I'm not eating as much because I don't have much of an appetite, so yeah, in order to get my calorie intake, I've eaten a few things that would normally be off limits, but only a very small amount. The problem is that with everything so haywire, that's being magnified disproportionately too. So, I need to go back to the drawing board. Why do this? Because with my gallbladder out, things are going to be wonky as my digestive system acclimates. Things that were safe before make me sick now. I've some coping mechanisms from my PCP in trying to figure it out moving forward but it's trial and error and in the meantime my safe meals are not safe for my new normal and it's been really making me crash out.

I know I need time and I need to chill but every time I treat and the numbers are way off what I was before this disaster happened, I lose my calm. I'm doing the best I can given the circumstances and I feel like I'm failing myself. I know I'm not, that this experience will pass and I'll get back on track but I'm so very tired and I need for something to go right. 

I try to be positive and kind to others on here because people need to hear that they have it in them to get things together, that it's not their fault, that people believe in them. It's not that I don't believe in myself. it's that right now I don't have the energy to fight. I want a good night of rest. I want to eat something that I know will help my blood sugar without it making me feel sick. I want to stop hurting. I want to stop feeling traumatized and over emotional. The bad part is over, it didn't kill me. I'm alive. It's really hard to internalize that when everything else feels like it's falling apart. ",1760593815.0,6,16,diabetes_t2,diabetes
1o7vyls,"Seriously, check your feet!","I'm very grateful to be the people in this sub who warned me to check my feet daily and so I'm passing on the message!

A couple of days ago, I found a tiny hard bump in my heel. About the size of a pinhead. It's painless and I can't feel it when walking,  so I wouldn't notice it unless I was actively checking. I went to the doctor today, and it's a corn.

It needs to be removed, because a corn can ulcerate. And because it was discovered so small and at such an early stage, I can treat it at home with urea lotion to soften it and let it slough. I won't need to have anything invasive done that could lead to nerve damage in my foot or infection of a surgical site. 

So absolutely check. And if you find anything that you don't understand, even if it's painless and seems minor, get it checked by a professional. I felt a bit ridiculous going to the doctor with a tiny, painless heel bump, but it turned out to be absolutely the right move. It's always better to know what you've got!

1o7jx7v,How I'm doing with Type 2 Diabetes right now after a Week,"Well, I just want to tell you some questions and anecdotes…and also get my stress out a little

*the week I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes was very hard for me, first in the previous months I was dealing with my autism, and now that it finally seemed like everything was going to be okay…this had to happen, I was worried about other things because I didn't exercise and I didn't eat healthy, I mean I did exercise and ate fruit but I feel very guilty and sad, although it's also because of inheritance because my mom's grandmother and my dad's grandmother had diabetes…,My father told me that diabetes will also come to him sooner or later…I wish I could go back in time and tell my past self to exercise and eat healthy telling him about diabetes to traumatize him and motivate him to do it…but oh well, the only thing I do after taking my daily hour walk, eating my diet (I also don't eat much lately), taking my medication and insulin, is stay in bed depressed, without wanting to do anything, sometimes crying and wanting to die, thinking that in heaven I could eat sugar again, I know I'm exaggerating but I can't help it, I try to be positive and optimistic, I try to follow your advice and the doctor's and I try to follow the diet and exercise, and take my medications but this is driving me crazy… I think I need help, literally when I went to a clinic with my mom, I collapsed, I told them how sad I was and how much I wanted to die, that I should continue with diabetes and I didn’t realize how worried my mom was (I felt bad…but I couldn’t help it), while I was getting anxious and stressed, I’m surprised that my sugar level hasn’t gone up that much because of that, I guess it’s because of the medications, as much as I like sugar I am very afraid of eating it, even if it’s just one gram of sugar, and well ironically that fear helps me with my diet too….

since I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, I am not as hungry as I used to be, even before taking the medication, I literally used to eat a lot but now I barely eat 3 small meals a day, AND I DON’T EVEN FINISH THEM, since I feel like my body doesn’t want to eat much…, a chicken and vegetable sandwich that I would normally eat in minutes now I leave halfway through, I try to eat the whole thing but my body won’t let me, the same with a fish that I left halfway through, and with the pizza the next day I barely ate 2 pieces, and I left the other half for my brothers, although I do drink a lot of water, not because I’m thirsty but because my parents told me to, and that worries me, is it okay to fast and not eat so much? …sometimes I check my blood to see how it is, and it is usually between 80 and 100, I guess that’s okay and that helps me… I don’t have any symptoms but the pain in my stomach is VERY annoying no matter how much exercise or healthy food I eat, or what medication or insulin It never goes away, not even when I eat. It's driving me crazy. My doctor said it was because of the medication, but I don't even know if I can last... These past few days, I was thinking about talking to a therapist because I was suicidal and wanted to see if they could help me.

Things I Do to Help Me with Type 2 Diabetes…

1-Play Simulation Games
Something I do when I'm tempted to eat sugar is play simulation games. Look, I know it sounds a little ridiculous, but watching my character (my real self in the game) eat sugary foods is somehow soothing, since it feels like eating sugar again...and honestly, it's satisfying...at least for me, and it works most of the time.

2-Reminding myself that I don't want to lose my sight, my legs, or damage my body:
It scares me a lot, especially losing my sight, and one of the reasons I was nervous when I was diagnosed. I'm really scared :(

I'm going to continue with my diet and exercise...hopefully someday a cure can be found for this Shitty disease that everyone hates, and that we can all be cured, even if I'm 80 years old...the day the cure comes, I'm going to binge on sugar and fast food...even if I'm going to die of a heart attack...I just want to be optimistic this once",1760554871.0,4,1,diabetes_t2,diabetes
1o7i4eo,Had an argument with a nurse about high reading,"I’m 67, M, 52 kg; I know I’m thin, but that’s a different story. 

Background: This just happened. Friday night I was walking my dog (3.5 y.o. American bully female, 33 kg), when she heard a sudden noise. She bolted and before I could drop the leash, I fell, hard, and she dragged me about a meter on the sidewalk. End result, I now have a broken hip and have been in the hospital for 5 days, recovering from surgery and with titanium pins in my hip. 

Normally, my diabetes is reasonably controlled. At my last labs, my A1C was 7.1. My doctor wasn’t overly concerned, but increased my insulin to 20 units from 17. (Diagnosed in 2009; began insulin in 2023) Obviously the broken hip has been stressful, but since the accident, my blood sugar readings have remained well within range. All morning and evening (pre-dinner) readings between 100 and 130 mg/Dl since Friday, except this evening at 5:30p, when it was 177. Earlier this afternoon, my husband brought me a sandwich, some chips and a bottle of water. I ate around 1:30pm, and when the nurse came at 5:30 to check my blood sugar, it was 177 (it was 80 at 6am), she was going on about how it was too high and she was going to give me fast-acting insulin to bring it down. I said no, I don’t take fast acting insulin and that it would go down normally, this isn’t unusual, I’m sometimes erratic, etc.  I also said I know my body, that my doctor knows my history, and doesn’t find it necessary to prescribe fast-acting insulin. She was really pushing the f/a insulin and I just refused. She left in a huff, muttering under her breath. My husband saw this whole exchange. I hate being bullied, but was it wrong to stand my ground? Should I have just taken the f/an insulin? Has anyone had a similar experience?

1o683xi,Consider the +-15% when you do your readings.,"**FDA Requirements**: BGMs must provide readings that are accurate within 15% of the actual blood glucose level for 95% of tests. It use to be +-20%.

The 307 is considered accurate if the actual value is anywhere between 260.95 and 353.05. That's plus or minus 15%. A 92 point spread.

The 366 is considered accurate if the actual value is anywhere between 311.1 and 420.9. That's plus or minus 15%. A 110 point spread.

To me it's weird how both these readings could be considered accurate, but not if we compare them to each other. Are they accurate? or is one, or both meters bad? We also have to consider the difference in how the levels are measured too.

The higher the readings, the larger the spread. This is why the meters are nice as estimates, but we can't consider the value as exact. For those with Low BG, you should also consider the spread when looking at your numbers, although the numbers are lower, so less of a spread between the extremes. 

At least once we get our numbers under control, the spread is less than at the higher values, so they should be more accurate.  For instance, a reading of 120 could be anywhere between 96 to144.  A spread of 48 compared to a spread of 110 in the 366 reading. Still, it's an estimate, and not exact.

1o63ztb,FreeStyle Libre 3 Plus False Alarm - Errors & Cover-up!,"I was woken up at 1:38am from my phone going off because of a Libre 3 Plus Alarm.  I freaked out. I have NEVER had my BG go below 100 never mind getting to 59! I got up and checked it against my Accu-Chek with a prick. The Accu-Chek read 112. Over the next 6 minutes I watched the Libre 3 slowly get back to a more accurate reading.  

I ended up taking the sensor off my arm 26 hours into its use. The weird thing is, the spot where it was inserted was wicked painful for the next day too. I worried something was left in there, but it cleared up. 

I had never really had a problem with the Libre 3 (Not Plus) in over a year, although the very first one I tried failed quickly too. Other than that, things were going well.  

This has happened to me in the past too, since I started on the ""Plus"", and after the fact I had wished I had started my screen capture on my S23. This time I was quick enough to capture it. 

Notice how over those 6 minutes the graph slowly hides that low spike, basically hiding the flaws in either the software or the sensor. It's as if it never even dipped. I was groggy and it took me a minute to start the recording. At least the Log entry shows it going down, but not as low as the 59. It may have even gone lower, just not saving it to the log book. 

This was actually my FIRST Libre 3 Plus. I had been using Just the Libre 3's up to this point (No ""Plus""). It was so stupid they named it  3 PLUS and not Libre 4 because I had a real battle with the Doctors AND the Pharmacy AND my Insurance to get the newer device. I am sure I got the Libre 3, but not Plus because when they selected it from the databases they were probably thinking, ""Oh, there's the Libre 3, so that must be it"". I think it was too new to be in some databases yet. Good Job Abbott! \*sarcasm

I digress...

I do like the Libre 3's, Plus or not. It beats pricking the finger every hour to get a true idea of what's happening with the BG levels. I just consider it a rough guide line now, and not all that accurate. Abbott needs to do better. 

1.  I understand they are allowed to be +- 20% and still considered accurate, but the higher the readings, the bigger the spread. And it seems the reading are often even outside that 20%. 

2. They need to let us adjust the time for entries that are anything other than a reading. I understand locking the time for readings, but I often forget to enter things and have to repeat because the date/time are off from when it actually happened and the only choice is delete if the time is wrong.

3. They need to give us more control over general alarms. THIS alarm for me was probably a fluke, but I have read others having the same issues. Not sure if it's from  phone app being bad, the firmware in the sensor, or just its overall hardware design.  Also not sure if it's just the ""Plus"" version. I never really had issues with the NOT PLUS version. 

I have not updated the phone software to the newer version. I got a warning I should because there's NEW software. But after reading the reviews, the ratings make it seem far worse than the one I am using. I don't know. I will ask that of users in a separate thread. 

Sorry for the Novel. Just thought I'd share.

This Sub has been a lot of help to me, so Thank you all for that!

1o5yv84,T2 Diabetic at 17. Is my life over?,"On one hand, I can't believe it. On the other hand, it makes perfect sense. For years, my diet has been terrible. Carbs, fat, sugar, and overeating. Pair that with lackluster exercise and it clicks. I feel like my life is over. More than anything I feel complete and total shame, stronger than I've ever felt in my life. I can't even tell my friends about it because it feels so shameful. I'm already experiencing retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy, which according to what I've seen are irreversible. My retinopathy seems to fluctuate day by day from managable and hardly noticeable to not great at all. At first I thought it was just normal vision loss since my parents both have naturally terrible eyesight which they needed glasses for at around the same time. I don't want to live a life where I can't see my S/O's face, a life where I can't feel my feet hit the water, A life that my research tells me will probably end 15 years earlier than it would have otherwise. Add that together with averages and it looks like I'm going to die at 63. My whole life, ever since I was a little girl I always wanted to make it into my nineties. Now it looks impossible. Half a life is not a life to me. Dementia and cognitive decline are my number one fear in the world, and word has it those are pretty common among diabetics. The dread consumes me constantly. My doctor won't help me. I don't have money for insulin either. I've started Keto, getting 75 minutes of vigorous exercise a week, and doing Extended Fasting all at once, but my symptoms persist. I feel like there's no way out. I'm doing everything I possibly can and it's not getting better. I bought a BGM and it came with a dead battery. I have no idea what's going on. I have no idea if it's getting better or worse, other than that I've lost about 24 pounds in the last few months from my efforts. There are so many diabetics in the world but it feels like there are none who are as self induced-ly fucked as I am, at such an early age. Am I cooked?

Removing: Fried foods, soda's, bread from my diet

Eat mostly fruit and salads for lunch with occasional grilled chicken thrown in the mix

1o5hr19,Off my meds,"Hi, so I have been diagnosed with type 2 almost 20 years ago? But recently found it that its actually MODY. I was on Metformin (2000 mg) nad Trseba insulin (12units at night).I recently travelled to Australia for studying,  missed a few doses of metformin what with travelling and then some things going on. With metformin I have to make sure I have a big meal before. Also i get sick no matter what every other week. So basically if I am in a bit of a tight or difficult situation,  it is hard to keep up with my metformin. I have been off before (pregnancy,  breastfeeding,  trying new meds) and insulin worked great for me and also other meds but for some reason doctors love to go back to metformin!!!!!.
Anyway, I got an appointment to see a gp, took long enough but finally got to see her, she seemed confused by my situation and I told her that my blood sughas been high ...like 180-300 almost every day now. She run blood tests and give another appointment a week and a half later. Finally I go to see her again but she says she is not sure what to do and maybe I should go back to metformin.... she said I got a referral to an endocrinologist but still waiting on that and it might take too long. 
Thing is, met will take at least 2-3 months to kick back in, I know I havae experience.  I am really exhausted now, feel like I eat but without any ener
Also can't afford to be sick from metformin npw just to wait for it to kick start again. Now I don't know much about the system in Australia,  do I go to another gp? Should I wait for endocrinologist? Start metformin again? What do I do? Does insurance cover another gp visit? For the same problem I mean? I am really lost back home I always have insulin,  meds available and I definitely know how to get medical care but here I feel lost 



Please I know how bad this is for me what with stopping metformin. I was going through a really rough time while travelling,  I got a scholarship and things were not so easy for me. I was under a lot of stress too. And I know it sounds like the meds were working why would I stop them. Well because if I didn't have a heavy meal before metformin I get violently sick like throwing up my guts until I start throwing up blood. So anytime I can't have a big solid meal I have to skip the meds. 



Edit, my A1C was 7.9 and my random blood sugar at the vlinic was 6.0? Not sure what's that in mg/dl but at home my morning's blood sugar is 180, im not so sure my glucometer is not off !!!",1760356876.0,7,4,diabetes_t2,diabetes
1o5h6ls,First Projectile Vomit,"Hi guys so I been a short time lurker from my diagnosis on August 14th, 2025 (F25) but today I decided to get my butt up on here and post. 


So month one, my A1C was 8.4% and they put me on metformin and titrated up from 500 mg to 2000 mg. I didn’t lose much of any weight, diet changed only a little and not much exercise. 


1st follow up visit yielded an A1C of 7.8% but not much weight loss however I was a shit storm literally with the metformin. I catch public transit too so it’s inconvenient for me to stop all the time to 💩. 


Dr put me on ozempic. i’m on the 0.25 mg. first week was not much of a difference except for the constipation. second and third week got better. I would get nauseous but not that much. I had been injecting into my stomach then. 


Last night, I decided on a whim to try my thigh. This morning I woke up feeling “different” (like a little more confident). So I go eat some of my leftover pho and outta nowhere I get this sudden strong urge to vomit. low and behold I did and now idk how to feel lol. This might be a wakeup call to really change my diet.

1o5f3ot,My first days with Type 2 diabetes,"Well, there will be a lot of text in this post since I'm new to diabetes, and I recommend you read everything before commenting. I just want to thank everyone for the supportive comments on my previous post.

I've been exercising a lot these days. One way that motivates me is to listen to music while I go for an hour-long walk a day. It calms me down and motivates me to keep walking. I do it every day. I usually do it with my dad when he has free time. He doesn't have diabetes, but he doesn't eat sugar because, according to him, he's at high risk for diabetes. We often talk while we walk, and that relaxes me too. My mom doesn't eat sugar either, for the same reason.

With food, I usually eat various fruits, such as tangerines, apples, pears, and other fruits. I've always liked fruit. For breakfast, I usually eat eggs and sugar-free crackers, and for dessert, it's usually sugar-free fruit yogurt. As for drinks, I was already used to drinking only water and sugar-free fruit smoothies long before diabetes. I usually take a bottle of water to my room, since I rarely drank soda. To be honest, I rarely ate sugar, although it still hurts that I can't eat it. For example, I used to eat one a day of waffles with sugar. Now I'm thinking, for example, about eating only half and giving the other half to one of my brothers. Although sometimes, out of sadness, I don't want to eat much and just stay in bed crying...

Currently, I'm fine. So far, I haven't had any of the symptoms of diabetes (well, except for having to urinate a lot, which is annoying. Curiously, I only urinated once today and at the time of writing, I still don't feel like peeing. That's because I drink so much water. Luckily, it doesn't happen when I'm sleeping. I also feel pain in my stomach and sometimes my stomach growls. Even though I use medication, maybe because of the change in diet. According to my parents, who are used to not eating sugar, that's normal... I hope they're right). I'm not as thirsty as I thought, but I still tend to drink a lot of water out of fear. And my eyes are clear; they're not blurry. I also sleep a lot, especially on the weekend, mainly because of the fast and trying to forget about food out of sadness and fear. I also haven't felt dizzy or trembling in my hands or feet, and that was before taking insulin. I'm still careful with that.

No part of my body hurts (maybe except for stomach aches, which I hope is due to the diet). Even before it was confirmed that I have diabetes, I never felt tired and often moved around the house a lot.

Well, I just want to tell you how my diagnosis is going. According to my doctor, I can no longer eat sugary things and drinks, apparently for a while. I also use medications like insulin. My parents usually administer my medications. For some reason, since I was diagnosed, I don't want to eat as much as before, which seems strange and worries me a little, although it might be because of the depression I have...

And interestingly, it seems that I only have problems with sugar, because I can still eat fatty foods, like pizza, hamburgers, and pasta, although it's probably because I didn't eat them as often. For example, I used to eat half a pizza and the other half. Half for the next day, although sometimes I wouldn't eat it and give it to my siblings. I also kept it in moderation. There are times, for example, when I wouldn't eat a hamburger for weeks. Besides, when I did eat them, I didn't feel bad, even before taking insulin. I felt like I always did before having diabetes. And I always tend to eat a lot of fruit afterward, for example, apples, and drink a lot of water... and yes, also out of fear. In fact, I ate quiche the other night a few hours after taking insulin and with mayonnaise, but I didn't realize the mayonnaise had some sugar in it, and I got worried. I was hoping my blood sugar would go up, but it didn't. In fact, it went down. I don't know if it's because of the insulin, but maybe it is. This morning it was 102, at least for now.

In fact, according to my parents and apparently the doctor, if I exercise and eat healthy, I can eat sugar again, although not as much as before, and the diabetes is still there,The fact that I can eat sugar again surprises me. As a sugar fan, it motivates me to keep going and not give up.

Even so, I decided It's better to follow what the doctor says and not eat sugar for a good, LONG time and then eat, for example, a small sugar candy to see how my blood sugar is... and like everyone else, I wish this shitty incurable disease that ruins your life didn't exist.

1o504hl,T2 Back UndercControl,"Hi All,

After much lurking, reading, and educating myself from the contributions by everyone on this thread, (Thank You!), hopefully I’m ready and can add some value.

I am a bit of a unique story as I was diagnosed as an acute T2 diabetic, with no awareness whatsoever that it was coming. I am a 58, 5 foot eight, thin individual with no underlying conditions, and in the words of my doctor, simply don’t meet the stereotype of a late in life type two diabetic. After some investigation, I did learn that there was quite a bit of diabetes in my family, so I believe it was genetic. I’ve also always had a carb heavy diet, love red meat, pasta, rice, sauces, bread, etc., many of the things that I can no longer eat with reckless abandon. 

After losing 30 pounds unexplained and going from 160 to 130, feeling fatigued all the time, with frequent urination, I was scared that something very serious was wrong. After a couple doctor visits and labs, it came out that my A1c was 11.7 and my glucose was up in the 300’s. My doctor immediately put me on daily insulin and metformin. That day I changed my diet and completely cut out carbs and sugars and haven’t looked back. I was never a real sugar or sweet eater outside of ice cream, so that wasn’t difficult, but a lot of the sauces and other products had a lot of added sugars in them. I became an OCD label reader and limited my Carbs to 10 g or less a meal, often times more towards zero.

I also started taking 20 minute walks after dinner, and hiked on the weekends, but I did not really have the time or start a daily exercise routine.  After just two weeks, my numbers were so low that my doctor took me off the insulin. Within another four weeks, I was also able to get off the metformin completely because my numbers were going too low as opposed too high. I remain medicine free to this day. 

Three months after my diagnosis my first A1c was at 6.2. Since then, about six months into this, I’m currently around 5.8., and that seems to be my sweet spot for a life I can still enjoy and being back in the prediabetic range. However, I can attest that once a diabetic, always a diabetic because if I stray at all, I will spike. I found some great alternative foods like HERO breads, hearts of Palm pastas and rice, low-carb ice cream bars, and I find that somethings don’t really affect me, like Yukon gold potatoes, burritos minus the rice, mixing wheat pasta with zucchini noodles , and going for high fiber, low-carb replacements, like low-carb tortillas, etc.

I know this is a long post, and thank you if you’ve read all the way through it. I am happy to answer any questions I can to help anyone else in a similar situation and especially those who may be new to type two. It was overwhelming in the beginning, and it almost felt like I had received very serious sentence. But with the exception of having a hard time with balancing alcohol now and again socially, which I used to enjoy, I’ve found a pretty good balance. I’m always open to exchanging ideas, especially on things that work for others and yummy foods out there that are good replacements or give us a feeling of cheating, when we’re not. Thank you so much and good luck to everybody!",1760301642.0,22,10,diabetes_t2,diabetes
1o4wdn1,Thoughts on Dexcom Stelo?,"Hi all!

I’ve been dx t2 for two years now. I’m not insulin dependent, I’m on Mounjaro only for control. My A1c is well controlled at 5.1. 

I currently use a Freestyle Libre 3+ as a CGM. I don’t have to monitor glucose necessarily with how well I’m controlled but I like a CGM to keep track of patterns plus watch to hypoglycemia which I get occasionally. I pay out of pocket for them at $75/month. 

I do not like my Libres. They don’t stay stuck on well, the readings are wildly inconsistent and inaccurate, and they tend to break or stop reading a week in. I’ve gotten replacements for the last 4 or so, but I’m sick of contacting Abbott for it, especially since I’m paying. 

I was looking at switching to the Stelo. Anyone have experience? I like that I can get it shipped to me, it’s not much more expensive than my Libres, and I’ve heard you can calibrate it with finger sticks maybe?

1o4r2qf,Cheat days and increased motivation,"Quick disclaimer: I'm not saying that this is applicable to everyone, just me.

I got diagnosed almost exactly a month ago and made immediate changes to my diet. At first, it was just low carb, high protein and fiber, moderate healthy fats. I also had the carbs with every meal and had 3 meals a day + a snack.

As I learned more over the next couple of weeks, I switched to 2 meals + tiny snack and intermittent fasting. I also get 10k steps a day. 

My postprandial has gone down from 359 to now in 140-160 range. (I'm on metformin 500mg twice a day. At first I was on sitagliptin 50 as well but my doctor stopped that).

Fasting is down from 220 to 120.

I've also lost just over 4kg.

But I've been feeling hella worn out recently and felt like absolute crap for the past couple of days on this diet. Today decided to throw caution to the wind and I had a cheat day. I didn't go for my walk because I've been feeling a bit sick. Had the same food for breakfast and lunch, but decided to have dinner. The dinner was similar to my breakfast and lunch, just a lil bit more carby, and I still ate the veggies, nuts, protein, etc before the carbs. I went over my calorie budget for the day for sure, but I feel great mentally, and I have all the motivation now to get back on the bandwagon.

I guess just wanted to share my story. In the past I've been terrified of cheat meals because many times those are the things that just ended my discipline and I was not able to get back to discipline. But I feel this time is different.

As I've shared here, I ended up in the hospital in late July because of a complicated diverticulitis with perforation, and was also diagnosed with diabetes with an A1C of 9.4% (measured August 18th). Was put on insulin and also had a dramatic weight loss during my hospital stay (almost 20 pounds in 2.5 weeks). 

I was super responsible with diet and meds and on Sep.10th my A1C was 7.9%. My doctor started weaning me off insulin and transitioning to just oral meds (metformin). I've been on a somewhat low carb diet (130-150g per day, so not strictly low carb), but exercising almost daily (biking about 15cm each way to work monday to friday, pilates 2 times per week, and at least one longer bike ride on the weekend). 

On tuesday I was admitted to the hospital again because I had the beginning of another diverticulitis flare (and now I'm preparing for a bowel resection later this year), which sucked and had me super down but the good news is that they tested my A1C again and it was 5.89%. I've also lost over 30lbs from my pre-july weight. 

I'm so beyond happy. It's been a super crappy week and I was feeling all my efforts were for nothing because I was really hoping I could avoid surgery, but seeing that I got my A1C to such low levels within the first 2 months of diagnosis makes me so happy.

1o3z684,What a great start to this Saturday!,"I was diagnosed last February (I wasn't surprised lol) and Doc told me what comes with it. He said 1/3 of my normal rice consumption, and I'd need to change my lifestyle; be more active since I've got weight to lose. Ok cool. He then asked me if I wanted a perscription to Metformin and potentially Ozempic down the line. I said, ""Nah, I got this.""

So, after my diagnosis, for 1 month, I ate the last normal meals I could before I began the change.
Meal prep, chicken, veggies, an absurd amount of greek yogurt and cottage cheese, and a whole lot of willpower. 

Throughout the months, I saw big changes on the scale, and on the blood work. Friends, family, coworkers, and Doc began to notice. Honestly, this was addicting. But still, I had ways to go.

Fast forward to today. I've made it! On the bloodwork at least. As for my training, I didn't start until late April since I wanted to make sure my diet was in control before strength work. Went from 250 lbs to 200 lbs. Much stronger, look better in clothes. The before pic wasn't 250 lbs, but it's a picture of me I hate as it sums up everything.

Doc never had me monitor my glucose. I asked him if I should, then he asked me if I wanted to because w/ the way I've been progressing, it seemed unnecesary. Ok cool.

I still eat rice (mixed w/ quinoa and lentils for extra volume). I hear chilling rice makes it better for us diabetics. I did this unknowingly due to meal prepping. Pleasant surprise, I guess. Generally, my eating hasn't changed all too much, and the reason for getting diagnosed was most likely because I drank soda like it was water. Now I only drink sugary drinks every once in a while. Soda was replaced by the Zero versions (honestly my cheat code). 

Lastly, I may sound crazy for this, but I think the diagnosis might've been the best thing that's happened to me. It forced me to really look at myself and take control. I have fixed my relationship w/food and brought back the discipline I had lost in college. Now my willpower stat is maxed out. I've still got ways to go, but at least the Diabeetus is behind me now. Big win!
I hope you guys eventually achieve this and feel what I'm feeling. Y'all got this and T2D isn't the end of the world!

TL;DR - Diagnosed w/ T2D, Doc asked if I needed Metformin/Ozempic. I said, ""Nah, I'd win"" - Actually won.

1o3f58d,Insulin goes bad when?,"TLDR: I think my insulin is bad because it wasn't refrigerated.  
  
I only went on insulin 10 days ago (for a decade + before that it was diet, exercise and metformin), so I'm still getting used to it. Trying to figure out how the regimen works, etc. 

I don't see my doctor for 2 weeks (earliest available) and the diabetes team for almost a month! (I live on a rural island, care isn't immediate to say the least :). 

I was traveling when I had a ""hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state"" ( if I remember the doctor correctly, long story). Went through treatment. They sent me home with insulin. 20 units of long acting (glargine) every evening and rapid-acting as needed (Humalog).

I changed my diet radically and immediately 10 days ago (back to what I was doing last year) and started exercising again (walking and swimming). 

**I am NOT** asking for medical advice, just trying to understand this better so when I do finally talk to the doctors I'll have a better grasp.

My bg bounces around 140-200 still :(. The only time it goes below 100 is at night while I'm sleeping. 

I assume they might up my long-acting. I'll find out.

IT's the rapid acting I'm curious about and am suspicious about something. I do as the prescription says. For example, if bg is over 150 before a meal, I take 3 units. But it seriously doesn't seem to do a thing.

For example, this morning I had a vegetable (asparagus, spinach, mushrooms) 2 egg omelet with a total of 6 g net carbs and a cup of black coffee. My BG was 134 before the meal, so I took 1 unit as prescribed and then ate my breakfast about 15-20. My BG shot up to 186. About 30 minutes later I was finally able to take a walk. It eventually went down to 150s where it is now. So I did 2 units before lunch. Ate a lunch with 2 g of carbs... That was an hour ago... still 156. 

It doesn't seem the rapid acting has an effect. Or am I understanding how it works incorrectly? 

OR....

The nurse told me I didn't need to refrigerate the Humalog pen, so I didn't until today (10 days later) when I saw a label (hidden under a bigger folded label) that said 'keep refrigerated'. I looked at the manufacturer's web site and it says it can remain stable under 86 degrees F for up to 28 days. (the highest it's been here has been '82)

I was diagnosed with T1 diabetes years ago after presenting in DKA. I was just turned 18 and this was 8 years ago. For most of my journey, I’ve been treated as type 1. Recently, my provider changed my diagnosis to type 2 because I’m negative for all antibodies — and I’m struggling to make sense of this.

My lived experience includes:
• DKA at diagnosis
• Long-standing insulin dependence
• High insulin needs historically (on a pump)
• Chronic symptoms: recurrent yeast infections, boils, hair loss, excessive thirst, blurry vision, and neuropathy in my legs
• Co-existing hypothyroidism

Since starting a GLP-1, my insulin needs have dropped significantly and I barely use my pump now — which adds another layer of confusion.

I’m not asking for a diagnosis here, but I am trying to understand how others have navigated situations like this:
• Antibody-negative diabetes with DKA history
• Reclassification from type 1 to type 2 (or vice versa)
• Insulin dependence + GLP response
• Autoimmune overlap (thyroid disease, etc.)

If you’ve had a similar experience, worked with endocrinology on this, or have insight into LADA, atypical diabetes, or insulin-dependent type 2, I’d really appreciate hearing from you.

Tandem with profiles and lack of app were just okay…
Omnipod and the redistribution of daily dose instead of adjustments by need seemed not right for me
Ypsomed seemed like the best choice, as if adapts and learns routine. E.g. during my period my insulin sensitivity increases a LOT so I normally have a full week of weird numbers that requires different carb ratio, correction ratio and even basal  number. From what it was told me, Ypsomed learns from my routine, meaning that if usually I walk every morning and therefore needs less insulin in the morning it will do as needed. This seems nice, but my question is, I do exercises 3x a week mon/wed/friday (same time/ same intensity), would it also learn this routine? Or is it just a daily thing?

1q9pxie,A GLP-1 was the gamechanger for me,"So I use u-200 insulin. I'm overweight - started at 195 when I should be 140. My insulin resistance has been on a steady climb for the past 3 years or so and just last August my a1c was 10.9, the highest I've had it in give or take 5 years. 

By this point I had went from using an Omnipod with the u-200 to the T-slim and started making diet changes and exercising. Nothing was helping with my control. To top it off I can't even use the T-slim to its fullest capability because it boluses every hour and the insulin stacks too much. I would've went back to the Omnipod but the canula is so short I wasnt consistently getting insulin.

Cue to my endocrinologist getting me on Zepbound/Monjauro (same med if you didnt know) 

Guys my a1c as of 2 weeks ago is 7.2

I couldnt stop smiling the day I found out. 

The plan/hope now is that I can get to a point where I can use u-100 insulin and hopefully lose a little weight so that if I ever have to come off the medicine my insulin resistance won't be as bad or I'll be more prepared. Either way I'm happy.

The SugarPixel comes with a proprietary non-standard USB-C charger and cable, and the instructions *strongly* warn *not* to provide power to the unit *any* other way. My unit died last night with a panoply of symptoms—old results displayed, overheating, failure to reboot, intermittent display, meaningless display contents—and I tried some other USB-C chargers and cables I had lying around from Anker and Apple to revive it.

*Big mistake!*

I contacted the SugarPixel folks. They explained that using *any* non-proprietary USB-C power voids their warranty, *even after the initial failure!* They’re happy to sell me a new display module that I can try to use to replace to fix my SugarPixel by myself, but given the assortment of observed symptoms, I strongly doubt that buying a new display would fix it.

I know things change over time and perfection is not reality but I want to be a bit more proactive about understanding my own patterns and management. 

Most of the last year I've been running my pump in automated mode and letting it do the majority of the work for me. It's been awesome and quite a bit of a stress relief to not have to think about things as much, and has done the job of keeping me in range for an acceptable amount of time. That being said it makes me feel a bit disconnected from truly understanding my insulin needs and and am left chasing numbers when my routine is off. 

I'm trying to figure things out better for myself. I've started analyzing my data from Clarity and Glooko to get an idea of my basal amount and timing and am testing out a conservative manual basal program. I'm also working on better logging my activity, bolus, and food on my dexcom app. And started using Qalzy to help understand my macros better.

I (20f) have been dating my T1D boyfriend (22m) for a few months now and I absolutely want to build a life with him, but there’s one thing that has been bothering me since the start of our relationship. I believe he’s burnt because his A1C has been around 9.5 for about 4-5 years (he told me). He knows he should take better care of his body, but he always injects his insulin way too late after meals and does it based on feeling because he doesn’t check his blood sugar and refuses a CGM (they’re quite expensive in our country and not covered by insurance for everyone + he said he didn’t wanna spend so much money on something that would only be of little help – which I disagree with, but can’t convince him). He also eats A LOT of sugary snacks, drinks and fast food and every time I ask questions about his diabetes management both out of curiosity and also to gently remind him that he should go easy on his body, he says he knows there are things he needs to improve, but never does anything. I can only imagine how hard it must be to manage this condition, so I understand why he’s like this, but for me health is a very important thing as I have horrible health anxiety and tend to worry about not only mine but also my loved ones’ health A LOT. I’m very aware that I can’t help someone who doesn’t want to be helped, but if he doesn’t change anything, I’m not sure how I’ll be able to deal with that in the future. I’m very careful about bringing up this topic with him because the last thing I want to do is pressure him or make him feel guilty or like a failure. That’s why I was wondering if any of you have a similar experience/a different point of view as a T1D because I don’t know how I can support him and help him through everything while encouraging him to take better care of himself without hurting either of us.",1768075587.0,3,3,diabetes_t1,diabetes

1q9938h,Please help me,"Edit: Thank you for all your support, guys. I'm sorry I don't have the energy to reply one by one. This weekend has been s***. I agree sometimes with the person who said he sounds suicidal, and that's exactly what I'm thinking right now. He just told me he doesn't want anything to eat when he told me he wouldn't want the beans I was was cooking. As he's already avoiding rice, pasta, potatoes and hates vegetables, I asked what he wants then and he said 'nothing'. He's done this before, spending days not eating for most of the day and then drinking a can of coca cola before bed. 
Maybe he's depressed, maybe we both are at this point. He's been diabetic for nearly forty years and, according to his family, always acted like this. Maybe it was something his parents should have managed when he was a boy. Too late now, it seems. His behaviour was always this, but got worse about two years ago, when he had laser treatment for diabetic retinopathy and internal bleedings in one eye.
For those who asked or suggested: I do have a counsellor. He refuses one every time I suggest it.
I do think about leaving him sometimes, but I feel anguished just to think of him feeling alone and being alone.
He's a lovely guy in many ways, so I think he's worth it, but as others said 'its impossible to help someone who doesn't want to be helped'.
For the person who said it's not my problem to deal with as I'm not the one dealing with diabetes:I understand your point, but what he does do affects me, greatly. I think if someone doesn't want any interference in their lives, they shouldn't marry anyone because their lives will be interconnected with someone else's life.
For those who asked: yes, he uses libre, which monitors his BG all the time and is connected to his phone. He doesn't set the hippo/hiper alarm because he finds it 'incovenient' at work and when sleeping... I don't really understand his way of thinking, but that's that. He would like and can afford to have a pump, but won't hear anything about buying his own...
I really don't know what to do. I only know that we seem to be both feeling miserable and not knowing what to do or even think 
Again, thank you for all your support and advice. You are all great and lovely people.
I've been married for over 15 years to a type 1 diabetic who, in my view, doesn't accept being diabetic and, in his words, won't allow diabetes to be his prison by checking his blood sugar frequently, even though he only has to scan the sensor.
We just had a big fight because due to one more episode of hipoglicemia and now I feel like a horrible person, but I also feel unhappy and can't see myself this unhappy for another 15 years.
I know lows and highs can happen with no fault of his, but in his case it's mostly careless. I'm always the one to realise he has hipo (as he rarely checks), but he either ignores me or gets annoyed when I tell him. It's been frequent over the weekends that he has hipoglicemia right after lunch because, even though his blood sugar is already low due to fasting too long, he takes insulin before lunch. Weekends is the time we have to discuss all our plans for everything (I have was looking for flights for summer holidays), but then I was 'talking to myself ' because his blood sugar was so low he wasn't happy even listening to what I was saying, but refused to go and eat something as I asked. This repeated behaviour was what made me lose it and argue with him, badly.
This carelessness has also been taking away my sleep and making me anxious.
More than once I've been awaken with him shaking in bed with convulsions. His blood sugar was so low libre wouldn't measure it. I rubbed honey inside his cheeks and stayed awake until he recovered. I was scared and I don't want to live my whole life feeling like this. One of this episodes happened when we travelled to a wedding. He ate all day, including dessert and didn't take insulins ALL DAY, even though I reminded him. At night he took a massive dose of insulin as his blood sugar was sky-high (I didn't know all that until after the convulsions, when he told me what happened). He apologised but keeps doing the same thing again and again. I wake up several nights listening to him calling my name just because I'm scared something else will happen while I sleep (it's been several some episodes of convulsions, some internal bleeding in the eye, all at night so sleep has been a nightmare. Apart from near car crashes while living in a country where measuring blood sugar wasn't mandatory for insulin users. So, I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is causing me anxiety and messing with my mental health).
I love him and don't want to leave him on his own after so many years together, but I'm also feeling really unhappy with the life I'm living. I have my own issues to deal with and I'm feeling really alone, despite living with him. Living abroad doesn't help as I have no one to turn to.
I don't event know what I'm asking here. I guess any advice from both diabetics or partners would be good so that I could see both perspectives.

1q937y5,Chronics of a type one diabetic,"I imagine you guys don't like ai but it's just too accurate to not share it. 

Living with type 1 diabetes means your blood glucose is almost never truly stable. It’s a constant, unpredictable back-and-forth between highs and lows that doesn’t just affect your body—it takes over your mind, your mood, your energy, your entire day. Most people without diabetes imagine it as a simple matter of “eat right and take insulin,” but the reality is a jagged, exhausting cycle that leaves almost no flat ground. You can do everything “right” and still end up on the same rollercoaster.

It often starts with a low. You’re going about your morning—maybe at work, driving, or just waking up—and suddenly you feel it coming on. Your hands start shaking, your heart races, you break out in a cold sweat, and a wave of intense anxiety or irrational anger washes over you. Your thinking gets fuzzy; simple math that you do every day (like calculating a carb ratio) suddenly feels impossible. You might slur your words, forget what you were saying mid-sentence, or make stupid mistakes you’d never make normally. You know you have to treat it fast—juice, glucose tabs, whatever’s closest—but in that moment you’re fighting both the physical symptoms and the panic that you might not fix it in time. You eat the carbs, wait the agonizing 15 minutes, test again. If it’s still low, you repeat. Even when the number finally climbs, you don’t snap back to normal. You’re left shaky, drained, emotionally raw, and mentally foggy for another half hour, hour, sometimes longer. You feel like you’ve been hit by a truck—headachy, spacey, unable to focus. And very often that rapid carb intake sends you rocketing into a rebound high.

Then comes the high. It can creep up slowly after a meal you bolused perfectly for, or hit hard from stress, hormones, a pump site that’s gone bad, or that rebound from the low you just treated. You start feeling thirsty—unquenchably thirsty—peeing every 20 minutes, dry-mouthed no matter how much water you drink. Your head aches, your vision blurs a little, and fatigue settles in like a heavy blanket. But the worst part is the brain fog: everything feels slow and thick, like your thoughts are moving through syrup. Concentrating on work is torture; conversations feel distant; you reread the same email three times and still don’t absorb it. Emotionally, you swing between irritability (snapping at people over nothing), apathy (not caring about anything), and a low-grade frustration that sits in your chest because you know exactly why you feel this way and there’s nothing you can do but wait for the insulin to work.

You correct the high, but it takes hours—sometimes many hours—for the number to come down and for you to feel human again. Even as the insulin finally starts pulling the numbers back toward range, your body is wrecked: that deep fatigue lingers, the brain fog thins but doesn’t fully lift, and now hunger hits hard. It’s not just ordinary hunger—it’s ravenous, almost primal, because the high has been burning through energy inefficiently, dehydrating you, and stressing every cell. Or maybe it’s because you’ve been holding off on eating while waiting for the correction to work, afraid of adding more carbs to an already elevated reading. Either way, your stomach growls insistently, your energy dips even lower, and you know you have to eat something substantial soon or you’ll crash into a low from the lingering insulin on board.

So you plan the next meal or snack carefully—count the carbs, adjust for whatever insulin is still active, maybe reduce the bolus a bit to avoid overcorrecting this time. You eat, and for a little while it feels good: the food settles the hunger, gives you a burst of energy. But then the cycle creeps back in. The carbs hit your bloodstream, the BG starts climbing again—maybe gently if you nailed the dose, or sharply if the insulin resistance from the earlier high hasn’t fully worn off, or if you underestimated how much was still active. Your CGM arrow points up, the alarms might chime, and you’re staring at another potential spike. You dose again, wait again, hope it doesn’t overshoot into a low this time. And just like that, the rollercoaster loops right back around—no real break, no full reset, just the next wave starting before you’ve even recovered from the last one. It’s this endless chaining of highs into meals into potential lows (or more highs) that makes the whole thing feel so inescapable, day after day.

As you all know new year = new deductibles. I went to Walgreens to pick up our Dexcom G7 (and other medications) and with my insurance they quoted me $470 for three (monthly supply). The pharmacist helping me said she’d try to look for coupons but came back with nothing and apologized. But while she was gone it dawned on me for the first time to check GoodRx. And kid you not, there was a coupon in GoodRx for all three DexcomG7s for $190!!! I gave it to her and it worked!

I saved almost $300 because I stopped to check GoodRx for discounts! I could have saved more if I went to a different store because on GoodRx it had coupons as low as $170, but I didn’t want to get my prescription transferred and wait in line elsewhere. I honestly don’t understand how the CGMs aren’t covered completely by insurance, it seems like they’re the definition of preventative care. Would love some insight if anyone here knows.

Ive had diabetes for 8 years, but completely lost control the last 5. just this summer, i startet regaining some controll.

Now that im in a better headspace, i also take the effects of high and low more seriously. And during the last 3 years, my feet have often gotten almost completely useless during highs, but works like normal a day after. I cant seem to lift my ankles while this is happening, like the muscle just straight up doesnt work. A couple of times i have just fallen down, and couldnt get up for like 15-20 minutes. Then a couple of days later, they were back to normal. Been long since one of these more extreme episodes, but the ankle thing happens more often than i would like still. And its somewhat painful.

Is this normal? I know muscle doesnt get nutrients and stuff, when my glucose is off wandering somewhere up in space… but still though, is this a universal experience? This just seemed a tad bit too extreme for occasional highs",1767931196.0,7,12,diabetes_t1,diabetes

I was diagnosed after college so I’ve never had to request accommodations for an exam before, and I’m not sure what’s realistic. I haven’t been diagnosed very long and can’t confidently feel my highs and lows. I would feel significantly more comfortable if I had a way of checking my blood sugar during the exam. But obviously they don’t typically allow electronics in the exam room, and food is usually only allowed at lunch. I wouldn’t be too worried about glucose for a normal exam but this is 8 hours.

Is there any way I’d be allowed to have some device in there to tell me my blood sugar? I assume they will allow me to have food available.

In theory I can read my glucose on my Apple Watch without it being connected to the internet if I have a G7. But I doubt they’d let me keep an Apple Watch on. Would they let me use my manual glucose meter every hour or two? Any other solutions?

Major stockpile, had to bring all of my insulin due to possibility of freezing if I left it in my cabin-esque home here. And my next refill isn't for 2.5 months.

If I get a cooler in a shipping box, and have my family stick it in there maybe with a couple gel packs but with bubble wrap around the insulin so no vial can touch the gel packs, how good are my odds to mail it to myself without it freezing? The destination (where I'll receive it) is indoors, and drop off will be indoors (wherever my family can drop off the package). 

But I mean, aside from it being freezing temperatures out in both locations, potentially in the 10s, if the stuff goes in an airplane won't that all get frozen?

Encellin has released interim Phase 1 results for its ENCRT cell-encapsulation device in people with type 1 diabetes. The study shows that the implanted device had minimal to no fibrosis and developed good vascularization, which is a major hurdle for cell therapies. Importantly, human islet cells remained viable inside the device for several months without systemic immunosuppression. However, no clinical efficacy data (C-peptide, insulin reduction, HbA1c improvements) have been reported yet. These results mainly demonstrate safety and feasibility, not a functional cure at this stage. *(AI-generated text)*

I used to eat bags of chocolate without giving insulin. I used to never care about checking my blood sugar. I think I possibly went DKA once from stopping my long acting insulin. I've never gone unconscious or anything *knock on wood* I also never let my levels drop below 200 because I was terrified of lows, and well still am as I live alone and no one to save me if I need it. Cats can't call 911 😅  I used to take 36 units of long acting insulin at night. Well, my eating habits have changed and actually have very limited appetite and lost like 10 pounds and I had to go down to 29 units. Well. The last couple days I kept dropping right away in the morning and throughout the day. I'd keep trying to fix the lows, just kept dropping unless I over ate. I decided to only take 27 units last night and now have been running a bit high today. High 180 low 200s. I've corrected slowly only taking 1 unit of insulin an hour. Finally at 126 but I'm guessing 27 units was too little for me. Maybe I will try 28 tonight. I did wake up low this morning though which is annoying and I only gave myself 3 units last night for the potatoes I ate so how I ended up low, I have no idea. I started on an antidepressant and have been having bad side affects and my anxiety is insane. So maybe my body is just burning carbs that way? I don't know. I'm tired of the lows.

I’ve went > MDI 1 year > Tslim 2 years > O5 1 year > back to Tslim staring two months ago.

i thought the Omnipod was the issue with my control going from 80% TIR on average to 65% TIR on average. But past two months Ive been TIR at about 55%.

i realize I may have been in honeymoon phase for a while as I stayed active and lifted weights regularly until last yea. Got a puppy and have had to sacrifice my 1 hour a day weight training or biking and walk the dog. I get like 12k-15k steps a day but I have a desk job.

here is my issue. i’ve done two fasting basal tests when I switched back to the Tslim, one at night and one during day. CIQ off all that jazz. My rate basal seemed to be 0.55 u/hr.

what Im living though is most days I’ve put the basal rate at 1 u/hr and carb ratio 1:6 correction like 1:45 and i sit at 200-300 alll damn day. But weekend comes and Im not doing anything crazy just moving around doing light chores more walking. i have to have my rate at 0.55 and correction at 1:65 and barely bolus for meals to stay in rang. i usually hit 70% TIR on weekends.

so I know is something durng the week. I eat healthy but im always starving as Im like 150 and 6’ super lean. I eat a lot of nuts like peanuts and almonds throughout the day like the equivalent pf a cup a day and like a cup of olive oil a day. This is the same on weekends though. (fYI doc said to eat this way as Im struggling to keep weight on).

i guess my question is has anyone experienced drastic insulin needs changing during week vs weekend? Do you find snacking on nuts to raise and keep sugars high? I did a 3rd fasting basal teat this past week during middle of day while working at desk and my rate only seemed to need to be at 0.6 vs 0.55. So is it food? I eat salads at lunch with like 30 gr protein and 30 gr healthy fats. Could tha be throwing it off? I walk the dog like a mile either befofe or after lunch wvery day too.

1q6de4m,"Chronic fatigue, SSRI antidepressants discontinuation syndrome and insomnia in diabetes type 1","Hi, I've had type 1 diabetes for 20 years, and although I have less and less energy and strength for anything. I'm chronically sleepy and tired even when doing Nothing and my blood sugar levels are pretty good, same as glycated hemoglobin level. I've read that some of you have a similar problem. For 18 years, I've also suffered from anxiety disorders with agoraphobia and insomnia. I take sertraline - zoloft, 25 mg, and quetapine 10 mg for sleep. Quetiapine is a really bad medication and I've been taking it for so many years continuously in small amounts because it messes with my blood sugar levels, especially in the morning. Even if I haven't eaten anything, my blood sugar immediately spikes at 6 a.m., often over 200. Because of this, I sometimes have to take extra Humalog. When I increase my Lantus, my blood sugar drops to 50-70 at night, which is dangerous. This medication messes with cortisol, which is why it looks this way. The medication has disrupted my insulin resistance, and I take about 30 units in the morning, 26 for lunch, and 20 for dinner, plus 26 units of Lantus. These are high doses. I stopped taking Zoloft for three months ago because I felt much better and had a little more energy. I feel like these pills are giving me brain fog, and I have a lot of trouble expressing myself like talking or thinking. After the three months I've stopped taking SSRIs, I developed strange depressive symptoms feeling kind of sick in the evenings, around 6-11 p.m., with a fever of 98,6°F. Sometimes feel warm, sometimes cold, and I feel chills, but I don't have other symptoms of the infection or cold. I learned it's delayed antidepressant discontinuation syndrome. I consulted a psychiatrist, and she put me back on Zoloft to fuel my brain and Trazodone 25 mg for sleep. I've been taking Trazodone for three days to get rid of the Quetiapine, but I've only slept for three hours for two nights and I'm useless. I've had my TSH and vitamin levels checked and they're normal. My weight is almost normal because that damn Zoloft is adding 4 pounds to my weight, and I'm not eating much. I am 31 and constantly feel weak and tired of life. I have no energy to do anything, sleepy and dizzy for half the day, and I can barely survive, even though I have to work.

1q6ahzd,Could Type One Diabetes be the cause of late/missed period?? (Frequent low blood sugars),"Could Type One Diabetes be the cause of late/missed period?? (Frequent low blood sugars)

Hi, I'm 19 and have been type 1 diabetic for 10+ years. Me and my boyfriend (20 yrs old) have only ever had protected sex and are very careful, but it's only protected with a condom (no birth control). I am currently 7 days late from when my period app says I was supposed to start it. My periods have never been more than 3 days late but I think there is a very very slim chance I could be pregnant because as I said, we use condoms every single time. 

The only thing other thing I could think of to be the cause would be that the last month I had a really bad week with a bunch of low blood sugars. I put my pump on a new spot I've never used before and I think it must of had excellent insulin absorbency? Maybe that isn't the reason, but either way while I had that pod on I had multiple severe lows everyday and then still even a few days after I took it off (I guess it messed with my Omni POD 5's automatic settings??). 

So yeah, what I'm asking is: Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? Is a lot of very frequent low blood sugars a known reason that your period might be late?? 

Also just aside from a diabetes point of view: Do you think I should go ahead and take a pregnancy test or do you think that what Ive mentioned above is the reason and I should give it more time? I've read about late ovulation and wonder if that's just what is happening to me (maybe because of the lows it just pushed my ovulation and period back a week??). Or do you think maybe even with always using a condom that I may be pregnant??

1q66263,Any Tips to Quell a Parent's Fear?,"Hi all. Apologies for the long post (which I may deleted later), but I'm trying to get some advice on how to help some parents and their kid out.

For context I'm a relatively new school nurse. Worked as an RN before, but rarely with people with type 1 Diabetes. I oversee a few schools, and one has a boy in 1st grade with T1D who has a 1:1 nurse to manage his diabetes. He has a CGM and pump, and has had one for years.  
  
Most students, even in Kindergarten, don't have a 1:1 nurse anymore since there is also a nurse on the school site everyday to help with dosing and symptoms, plus us District Nurses too some days. A 1:1 tends to be really restrictive for the student since they have to follow the kid everywhere technically, including the bathroom or when they're with friends. So I've also been asked by my supervisor if he really needs one still.

Seeing him over the past school year, I don't really feel he does. He's a bright kid, and mostly at his age we just would want them to be able to find an adult if their alarm rings, which he can do. He never experiences symptoms of being high or low. I've trained the site nurse (and she already had diabetes experience with kids), plus his teachers for helping with lows. We'd basically check on him during every snack and lunch time, count carbs and dose, get called if his alarm goes off, and slowly teach him more.

Parents ARE willing to work on not having 1:1 nurse, but are deathly afraid something will happen while he's at school, which I get, and also missing class. He's more often high than low since parents have said they underdose him out of worry. He is young, so they do a lot for him, even carrying his Omnipod when they go out.

If parents really want a 1:1 nurse, they will be able to, but we've had a lot of situations in the past of parents having a lot of anxiety that never really leaves, and the student goes into middle or high school unable to manage any part of their diabetes, which is harder for them in the long run.

I am drafting a 504 plan for everyone so he won't be penalized in school for missing class, can have his snacks whenever, etc. I just am trying to see if there is anything else I can say or do to help assuage his parents' worries? I know it'll always be there, and I know no one will care for him like his parents, but it's also part of my job to care and make sure he's safe but also learning and gaining independence, so I'm just trying to get some advice from people who experienced it more firsthand.

For what it's worth, the kid himself told me and his teacher he doesn't really care one way or another if someone is with him all day.",1767761099.0,13,43,diabetes_t1,diabetes

Technically I’m Type 2 as I don’t have the antibodies, but I’m more like a Type 1 as I have very low insulin production. A bit of mystery to my doctors. I started insulin last year with the shots and quickly moved to Omnipod 5.

It has worked extremely well for me EXCEPT when I’m sick. When not sick, the Omnipod easily keeps my blood sugar at 110. When sick even with a mild cold, I’ll be at 300 all day with no sign of it budging. No amount of insulin, either basal or Bolus, seems to do anything. I’ve tried manual mode with up to a 95% temp basal boost and nothing.

And another weird thing—I’ve never had any pump failures ever except when I’m sick. Last time a few weeks ago I had 5 back to back failures with all sorts of errors—communication errors, insulin max out errors, and nondescript errors with just a code. This time I’ve already had two.

1q5ubd1,Hemolysis Artificially Lowering A1C,"I got diagnosed 5 months ago when I went into DKA with an A1C of 12. I do MDI with basal in the morning and bolus before meals.

However, I avoid corrective bolus unless I'm over 230 because I hate the rollercoaster of lows and highs that come as I try to stabilize. 

Instead, I run on the treadmill to correct. Generally 5 minutes of jogging takes me down about 40-60 mg/dL, smoothing out shortly after the run before going back up around 10mg/dL later on. Saves me the rollercoaster frustration and the cost of extra insulin.

I got to see an endocrinologist finally (earliest appointment was 5 months out) and my a1c is 5.5. I was happily surprised with the results, but I've read that hemolysis, which happens when running, can artificially lower your a1c since your red blood cells have a shorter lifespan.

My CGM says 5.9 average over 90 days (about the same with acceptable error), but would hemolysis also affect that reading?

This is the article about the artificially low a1c, but they didn't say by how much it could lower it. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31204512/

We’ve been managing this for a while now, and although CGMs have been incredible, I still find the reports hard to truly understand in day-to-day life. The graphs are detailed, appointments are short and usually up-to 3 months apart and as a parent you’re constantly wondering if you’re missing something important.

I started experimenting with a better way of looking at the data;

	•	Takes a CGM report (Libre / Dexcom)
	•	Summarises recurring patterns in plain English
	•	Helps spot when highs and lows tend to happen
	•	Does not give medical or dosing advice

The idea isn’t to replace clinicians at all — it’s more about helping parents (and patients) feel more prepared and less overwhelmed when looking at the data. Did me a single page summary helps my discussion with the clinician if I have all the facts in front of me.

1q4zg1u,Tips to help with scars and lumps?,"Hey, I was wondering if anyone had any tips on how to make scars and lumps heal faster? I've been on a pump since 2009 but while I used to use 3-day cannulas, I've been using Extended cannulas that last 7 days for a bit over a year. Now, I absolutely love being able to leave my cannula for twice longer, and I no longer get the feeling that I have to change sites everyday, but I'm seeing a change on my skin.
Obviously, I already hard spots and marks on my sites before, but they've rightfully become worse since I've started leaving my cannulas for 5 to 7 days. And although I'm no longer as self-conscious about these marks on my legs and belly as I used to be, I feel like they're taking a bit too much room and I now feel like space is getting very limited for new cannulas, as I try to place them far away enough from sites that haven't fully healed yet. 
I was wondering if you knew of anything or used any method to help these sites heal faster? Be it massages, creams, anything? 
I don't want to have to revert back to the 3 day cannulas...",1767650185.0,3,3,diabetes_t1,diabetes
1q4wp5c,Anyone else suddenly running high after meals despite doing everything right?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been diagnosed with T1D for about 4 years now and overall I’d say I’ve been managing it pretty well. I’m pretty active, do regular cardio, and usually that helps a lot with keeping my BG in range.

But over the last few weeks, something feels really off. I keep spiking high after meals even though I’m bolusing more than I used to by far and actually eating fewer carbs than before. It’s frustrating because it feels like I’m doing all the “right” things and getting worse results.

Cardio still helps bring my BG down eventually, but the post-meal highs are stubborn and way more frequent than they used to be. No major changes in routine, stress is about the same, and I haven’t been sick.

Has anyone gone through a phase like this? Hormones? Insulin resistance? Basal needs changing? Just one of those annoying diabetes things?

Would really appreciate hearing others’ experiences or things that helped. Thanks ",1767644113.0,12,28,diabetes_t1,diabetes

I am not offering medical advice nor suggesting that anyone should blindly follow my suggestions. I have a separate profile set on my Tslimx2 for when I am sick. I have been using that profile since the steroids kicked in and began raising my blood sugar. To start with I will say that I am a 24/7 sleeper.  My sick profile stay as sleep 24/7 but my basal rate is pretty much double and my insulin to carb ratio a little less than 1 1/2 times normal my regular profile. My meals and mealtimes have pretty much all remained the same. I have had to make a few tweaks and a few added boluses here and there but for the most part my bs pattern has remained the same but with just about a 10 point higher daily average, I am usually at about 117. Hopefully people will find this helpful if they have to navigate the after effects of steroid injections. Again, I am not telling anyone to take this as me telling anyone how to handle their situation or am I giving medical advice. I am simply passing along what has worked for me.

1q4oxel,Confused about basal,"Greetings from Turkey, my fellow Type 1 friends. Before my question, I would like to share some background about myself.

I am a 39-year-old man. I was diagnosed two months ago. My C-peptide is 1.3, and both islet and GAD antibodies are positive. At diagnosis, my fasting glucose was 288 mg/dL and my post-meal glucose was 592 mg/dL. Before diagnosis, my symptoms were the same as many of yours: extreme thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue. After being treated in the hospital for 3–4 days, I was sent home with a diet plan that was actually designed for Type 2 diabetics, along with 22 units of Lantus and 12 units of Novorapid, basically to survive on my own.

After some time, because of frequent hypoglycemia, especially in fasting values, an internal medicine doctor adjusted my doses to 18 units of Lantus and 8 units of Novorapid. I am most likely in the honeymoon phase. One week later, I saw an endocrinologist. I should also mention that in Turkey, doctors see so many patients that communication is very limited. They usually speak only two or three sentences with patients. The endocrinologist told me that it is better to increase insulin doses slowly and advised me to continue with 4 units of Novorapid and 12 units of Lantus. During this time, my HbA1c had already dropped to 8.5% in just 25 days. At diagnosis, it was 10.5%.

I should also add that I follow a low-carbohydrate diet and I count my daily calories to avoid losing weight. I have completed carbohydrate counting education, I know my insulin-to-carb ratios, and I use a CGM.

Today, I visited the same doctor again. I had many glucose readings with me. When he saw that my numbers were very good, he reduced my Lantus dose to 9 units. However, when I wake up in the morning, my glucose is usually around 100 mg/dL, and I was actually going to suggest increasing the dose. I have not seen readings in the 80s for quite a long time.
So my question is this: Is there some kind of secret agreement among endocrinologists worldwide to keep blood sugar levels higher? Should I follow my doctor’s advice? Is there something he might be right about? I am open to any kind of help.

Thank you very much.",1767627558.0,8,18,diabetes_t1,diabetes

1q3zkfn,Absolutely detest my Tandem Mobi,"I have had my Mobi for about 6 months now after years on the T Slim. The Control IQ software remains excellent but everything else about this pump makes my blood boil and I cannot wait to get rid of it. Posting mostly because I’m so furious and literally can’t do anything but complain on the internet, and to warn other who may, like J was, be excited to make the switch.

Why do I detest thee? Let me list the ways…

1. Wireless charging only. What idiot thought this was a good idea? I always charged my pump while I slept. I had an extra long cable and at some point in the night I’d unplug and I was always good on battery. Now, the battery life is SIGNIFICANTLY shorter and I have to either detach or sit next to my precious charger perfectly still so as not to slightly move the pump and interrupt the charging. SO MANY TIMES I’ve put my pump in only to realize later it never charged. Must have been off the charger by a precious millimeter. I’ve had to wake up in the night to sit on the edge of my bed and charge my pump before going back to sleep just to make it through. And GOD FORBID you don’t have your exact charger with you when you need it, then fuck you just go ahead and end up in the hospital. The microUSB was universal. I could keep a portable charger on me for a pinch! I just cannot comprehend how someone thought this was a good idea. 

2. The cartridge is TOO SMALL. I get that it’s meant to be a smaller pump, but it’s still too big to wear on my body (as I had been looking forward to). Instead I just have to change my cartridge seemingly every day. I am pregnant and am on a lot more insulin than normal — about 90-110 units/day at this point. I cannot count the number of times I have had to leave where I was — just living my life — to go home and refill. Leaving the house for a few hours with 30 units and no extra insulin is no longer a thing I can do, and with the small cartridge it seems I’m doing this every fucking day. 

3. Cartridges can’t be refilled?! The only times I reuses cartridges on the T Slim was when I was in a pinch, but the option was a literal life saver. Now these stupid fill contraptions make it so you MUST have a brand new cartridge to refill. And with Tandem taking weeks to process new orders through insurance, this is downright dangerous. 

  
4. Alerts suck. My pump beeps when I’m at 20 units left and then never again to alert me to low insulin levels. I have messed with all the settings. there is no option. So many times it has been pure luck that I checked my pump to see if have ONE unit left and several times where I got to “Low” with zero alert. after 20 units, including one time in the night when I woke up because my sugar was over 200. Why? Because my pump had been out of insulin for hours and my pump thought that was totally fine. Same with insulin being off and battery being low. I forgot to “resume insulin” after unplugging to charge (see point 1) and ended up sleeping for 3 hours with no insulin. Woke up from the nausea. Pump hadn’t made a fucking peep. Had the same thing happen when the battery died while I was sleeping one night. 

5. Bluetooth connectivity. This was also an issue with the T Slim, but even when my Dexcom and pump are on the same side of my body, they lose connection often. Same with my phone. One time I couldn’t eat because my pump, which was physically touching my brand new iPhone wouldn’t connect and I couldn’t bolus. 10 min later it decided to cooperate. 

Bonus. Tandem still won’t release a version of Control IQ that’s recommended for pregnancy. When we are the most vulnerable and need the product most they tell us there is nothing they can do. 

In short, I have never felt more trapped by my diabetes than I do with this pump. Diabetes is hard. Pregnancy with diabetes is overwhelming. Pregnancy with diabetes and this pump is excruciating.

I really want to try and deliver vaginally this time around. As I didn't get to my first time and I kind of blame the doctors for it because they induced me with pitocin. At time I didn't know how to advocate for myself for the birth experience I wanted.

This time around I am going to try my hardest but there something else Ive been thinking about. Getting my tubes tied after birth.

I read up on it and it says they either do it while you're having a c section or do an incision in a similar spot under the belly button if delivered vaginally.

My doctor already thinks I'm going to end up getting another c section, and I want to bring up getting my tubes tied after delivery but I'm worried that will make them want to do another c section even more as it would result in less pain in the end of I did.

If I delivered vaginally and get them tied they still have to cut into me 24-48 after birth.
But if I delivered via c section, they can just go ahead and do it their. Plus they already think I should have one anyway.

I was diagnosed with T1D approximately 20 years ago and over that time, I've gained a lot of weight (currently about 60 pounds overweight).  Even when I weighed less, I struggled with insulin resistance, as I do now. My main goal if on a GLP-1/dual-acting agonist would be to decrease my insulin requirements and I realize weight loss will likely be a result of taking the medication as well, which would be great. Since insulin promotes fat storage in the body, I am hoping that if my body needs less insulin, I can drop some weight. The studies I've seen seem to indicate that insulin users lose less of their body weight (9% - 13%) compared to non-insulin users (15% - 22%) but something is better than nothing for sure!

I managed to hit my stretch goal of 85% as I’ve been pretty consistent with 80% or more in range. 

I was pleasantly surprised to get my time in range for this week because it’s been a wild rate adjusting all the other stuff like my I:C ratio and correction factor and trying not to crash if I went high and had to correct: candy and fruit snacks are on duty. I nailed the landing last night, so maybe I’m getting the hang out it. I still have a few more 10% adjustments to go, and the new gym I joined finally opened up.

I want the ability of others to follow blood sugars and both user and followers have alarms. Since it’s a new NDC/Pod prescription so before making the switch want to be sure. 

Will Libre 2 plus allow others to follow blood sugars if used with Omnipod 5?  In other words, does it have the same functionality as Dexcom G7? 

Can you set alarms as a follower with Libre 2+? Is this through LibreLinkUp? 

I assume will have to use the OP5 Controller (PDM) and can’t use iPhone app if on Libre 2+?

1q3i2dr,Dating,"I've never had too many bad experiences with dates when it comes to people minding that I'm a t1d. There were some that didn't know much about it and thus probably felt a little overwhelmed or just had a lot of questions.

I recently started dating a girl that was super interested in the whole topic, but didn't treat me like someone with a disability and rather as a person who happens to have to take a little more time in certain situations. She had no problems with anything at all.

Foreward a few weeks of dates and having a good time and I spent a night at her place. After we had a wonderful evening together, we got tired and went to bed. There she told me with a smile on her face, that if I ever get low during the night I should just open the drawer of the nightstand, which of course I instantly did. She put some sweets as well as a chocolate bar and some cola in there. I thought of it as a (in the literal sense) sweet gesture and a huge green flag.

Some days later we went to get some groceries which reminded me that I needed to get some batteries for my Ypsopump, but I forgot to buy them. Little did I know that the next time I went to her place and open the drawer I would find a pack of batteries in there as well. That brought me close to tears. I've never had someone treat me that caring and mindful on their own during a dating phase.

They mentioned considering [this product](https://www.muji.us/collections/toiletry-cases/products/hanging-case-with-pouch-ohca1a2s), potentially for their diabetic supplies. I honestly don’t think it would work too well, but I could tell they are looking for something that doesn’t look like a medical bag [like they have now](https://www.amazon.com/MEDMAX-Resistant-Insulated-Medication-Organizer/dp/B09WYK9D66?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1).

They told me that packing diabetic supplies for a trip is super stressful, and I want to help take some weight off their shoulders. So I was thinking of also getting them a larger bag or luggage insert that will help them organize everything and put a list inside of everything they should bring to help guide them. They have traveled for a month before, so they do have experience, but I want to help in any way I can.

That being said, I would like help finding the following products:

1. A small travel case for daily usage that doesn’t look like a medical bag, but that would organize their diabetic supplies well.
2. Either a large bag (again, preferably one that doesn’t look like a medical bag) or luggage insert that will help them organize enough diabetic supplies for two weeks out of the country.

I would also appreciate help in curating a list of what they should bring, so that way they wouldn’t have to think too much into it. If it helps, they have Type 1 Diabetes, use the Omnipod 5, and the Dexcom G7.

As of December 10 his A1C is at 6.6 and 67% of him being in thr target range which isn’t horrible but I would like to get it at 6 or below and improve his TIR.

For context I measure all his food and count his carbs. He does like food with a lot of carbs but I’m trying to get him to also try healthier things but it’s hard because of his autism. 

I prebolus an amount for his meals but can’t do a full amount due to the fact that he cannot tell me what exactly he will be eating so I have to bolus the rest after he is done eating. I think that’s what causing some spikes 🫩 so it makes it harder for him to stay in range.

1q37nxp,What is your TIR? And How much carbs?,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 30-year-old man with Type 1 diabetes for the past 10 years, currently on MDI (CGM + injections, no pump yet). I’m also developing a personal app to better understand insulin needs and daily patterns.

From my CGM data, I’ve noticed that both my ICR and ISF are strongly time-dependent. For example, my ICR varies significantly throughout the day:

**Typical ICR ranges:**

* Morning: \~1:7
* Afternoon: \~1:12–13
* Evening: \~1:16–18
* Late night: \~1:10

Even though I analyze my data carefully, exercise regularly (gym), and eat around **150g carbs/day**, my **90-day TIR is \~80%**. I often see people here reporting **90%+ TIR**, which makes me wonder what I might be missing.

So I’d really appreciate learning from your experience:

* What is your current TIR?
* How many grams of carbs do you eat daily (roughly)?
* If your TIR is **85% or higher**, do you have any specific tactics, habits, or adjustments that helped you get there?

I’m planning to move to a pump next year if the Irish government system allows me to enter the queue. Until then, I’d love to hear any insights—whether about timing, consistency, exercise management, or mindset—that I might be overlooking.

Recently I've been checking my blood sugar via finger sticks before treating any low blood sugar readingd from the sensor and I'm seeing my CGM read up to 30mg/dl lower than my finger stick says. 

  
This isn't just a one-off issue either. This is the 3rd CGM now to do this. The first one I called customer support over, and they checked my serial number and told me my sensor was defective and it was fine. And that none of my replacements were either. But then I got a letter in the mail saying pretty clearly that I HAD gotten a defective CGM at some point and it came with a big list of serial numbers to look out for. 

  
I just put this CGM on today and it's telling me my blood sugar is in the 50s while my finger stick says I'm only in the 80s. And I checked the serial number against the list before putting it on and it isn't on there. So I'm just exasperated at this point.

However, I also need to clarify I pretty much have a sugar addiction as well. I was eating the worst I've ever eaten leading up to my diagnosis just a ton of ice cream and candy. I was 26 at my diagnosis and I had blown out my knee that year so I was less active for the year leading up to it too.

My sibling is also type 1 but they've had it since they were a young child so I had some idea of what was going on. After being diagnosed I hopped on metformin 500 mg twice a day along with a CGM. I got my A1C down to 6.6 on my followup visit 3 months later. My Endo who diagnosed me as type 1 hasn't even started me on insulin yet because of how much I was able to control my A1C just by cutting carbs/exercise.

My question is, is it possible that  my original diagnosis is because of type 2 but I also have the type 1 antibodies which will start later? Through just eliminating carbs I was in range 100% of the time.

1q2oe44,Pumps and sensors,"There wasn't a tag for ""frustration"", so ""Support/Advice"" will have to do. 

Why can't insulin pumps and sensors just ""work""? 

A bit of history: I started pumping over 10 years ago. I was on Medtronic for the longest time and then their sensors started failing when they moved to the Guardian 4. I gave up on them last year after multiple issues and moved to Tandem T-slim. It works great... but the bluetooth link to the Dexcom 7 is terrible and is always losing connection.

Fast forward to November, I put on a Dexcom 7 like I normally do, and immediately broke out into hives. This had never happened before. After a whole bunch of internet research, the general consensus was that Dexcom had changed their adhesive and didn't tell anyone. Ok, problem isolated... or so I thought. So I got a piece of tegaderm and used that as undertape. A couple hours after doing that, I broke out in hives again, this time everything under the tape was red, irritated, and itchy. So I ripped that off.

Went to see the doctor and he prescribed me some cream to put on the rash and we talked about starting up the freestyle libre 3. Got a script and tried it tonight. No itching (yay), but within 1 hr after the sensor warmed up, it lost signal with my phone, which was right next to it. And now, 2 hrs later, I got a message on the libre app to replace the sensor.

It's so exhausting. Diabetes is frustrating enough without all these problems. But when pump therapy works, it works amazingly. I'm thinking about going back to Medtronic. At least their sensor issues were sporadic and didn't cause my body to break out into hives.

1q2l5fm,All the emotions,"Couldn’t decide whether to tag “seeking support” or “rant”. I’ve always found this sub to be helpful for feeling supported by people who can relate, though by sentiment this feels pretty ranty.

I’m just so tired of not being able to sufficiently explain what a pain in the ass everything is. It’s all manageable of course, and generally I’m very positive about it all, especially when those w/out T1 who are genuinely curious ask questions and then say things like “wow that sounds really hard”. I point out the silver linings, like being more in touch with my body and generally taking better care of myself, and all the advances in technology that have been made, etc.

Maybe I’ve just had a long day. I’m on vacation with my boyfriend of 4 months, who already follows my dexcom readings and has been above and beyond supportive in every way possible. This is our first significant travel together, and I did warn him in advance I always stress about packing and about going out for the day in that I like knowing what to expect so I know what to bring. We’re learning how to literally navigate stressful situations together, so I know some of the issues are compounded with that.

The straw that broke this camel’s back today was me getting frustrated over yet another occlusion alarm on my tandem pump, because I’ve been going through sites at a rate that might leave me without any before the trip ends, even though I packed significantly more than needed. It was just him saying “well they should have some at Walgreens or something we can go buy right?” that sent me into the cry zone, because earlier in the week (another failed site) he remarked how those parts can’t be that expensive and I laughed and told him the bullshit I deal with just to reorder pump sites and yeah they should be cheap but they’re not and how Bryam is shady with billing, yadayada.

I got mad this evening and pointed out that even though he follows my dexcom, he had the convenience of being able to turn off the high BG alarms when they quickly got annoying. I can turn those off too, but I still have to deal with the side effects and repercussions. If he wants, he can turn off all notifications and just move along.

He makes significantly more money than me and pays for things (like this whole vacation) proportionately, but we had a discussion once where he seemed genuinely confused and concerned on the fact that I don’t have more money to spend based on what I make. It upset me because I feel like I’ve complained at length of the cost of being T1 in the US.

I know when I complain about this stuff to him it probably sounds like a different language, and I don’t expect him to write it all down or anything. Right now I’m feeling like shit cause I got mad at someone who has gone out of their way to try to understand, but still doesn’t. I’m glad he doesn’t, as I don’t wish this experience on anyone, but I think I just get frustrated that at the end of the day I still feel very alone in the experience. I know he’s trying, but especially when my sugar’s been high all day and I’m pissed just thinking about having to pay my Byram bill to reorder the shit that makes this disease “manageable”,  knowing it’s perceived far cheaper and easier than it is by someone who’s actually trying (and has heard more than an earful about it)…just breaks me.

I was diagnosed as an adult, and I have similar feelings/frustrations with my family members. I know that ultimately I am responsible for myself, and managing mishaps and emotions and shitty ends of the stick are things everyone (diabetic or not) has to deal with in some capacity. Half the time I admittedly do feel like a victim, and the other half I’m disgusted with myself for that reason.

Idk my point. I just needed to get some words out to those that I know will understand fully. This sub has filled me with endless amounts of knowledge and support, and I still know that at the end of the day, dealing with diabetes makes all of us stronger and more resilient. Perhaps this is just an appreciation post for being able to vent at all without feeling like a boring burden. Love to all.

I feel like this is probably aimed at a pretty small subset of people but…

Endurance sports - and specifically cycling have moved towards a view that everyone should eat a ton of carbs all the time to prevent bonking. Keagan Swenson’s famous quote is that these aren’t cycling competitions, they are eating competitions. 

With that said, has anybody out there with T1D tried anything close to the 120g carb per hour recommended by most teams these days? Is it possible? Do you then actively bolus while riding?

I’ve long had a problem with going low in the night after hard rides or multiple workout days in a row as my muscles and liver try and rebuild their glycogen stores. W it’s been a struggle even when I intentionally go high before bed. I’m curious if upping my intake during the ride would minimize glycogen usage and therefore make me less likely to go low.

1q28v9e,I can't afford this and I don't know what to do,"I've been laid off for the first time since becoming diabetic and I have no idea how to manage the costs now. 

I had to switch to marketplace health insurance last year after my workplace closed and laid everyone off. I wanted to make an informed decision about which plan I should choose based on how well they covered my biggest expense- my diabetic supplies. 

**The Problem:** Durable Medical Equipment (DME) is not included in the formulary for any of these insurance plans. There is just no information available online about how DME is covered. 

Here is the list of people I asked-

* My endocrinologist
* My endocrinologist's billing department
* A customer service rep for the insurance marketplace
* Several customer service reps for several insurance companies
* An insurance broker
* DME supplier customer service rep (Tandem and Dexcom in my case)

Nobody could give me any more information than I could find online. I had to just make the decision blind! It turned out that the health insurance I chose didn't cover dexcom at all, and only covered supplies for an Omnipod. 

In November I changed plans again but I didn't have any more information than the first time around. I'm exploring my coverage now and it seems like they also don't cover dexcom supplies. The rep on the phone couldn't tell me anything about insulin pump supplies either.

I tried to ask my doctor about switching back to insulin pens and finger sticks (maybe that set up will be cheaper?) but she just blew me off and told me she really wanted me to use a cgm. 

I'm collecting unemployment benefits for a little while longer and don't qualify for medicare in the mean time. 

I got diabetes late in life. I don't know any other diabetics in real life and I don't have any familial support. I'm blowing through 7 years of careful savings at breakneck speed and I don't know what to do.

1q1j5lu,I took my OP5 off right before a flight and it looks like the pressure caused about 4 units to come out,"https://reddit.com/link/1q1j5lu/video/pik2iwtjrtag1/player

I know a lot of people have never experienced issues with this (including me until a few months ago) but I'm posting this in case this helps anyone. I saw a study that says that the pressure change might cause about 0.5 units to come out but it looks like it can actually be much more than that.

After randomly starting to have issues with severe lows on flights, I decided to take my OP5 off right before a recent flight. Once I noticed my ears pop, I pulled out the discarded pod and watched about 6 drops come out of the cannula. Each drop is about .7 units so that'd be (very) roughly 4.2 units.

This could probably be handled pretty easily by some people but as someone who uses less than 20 units a day, it's been pretty hard for me to deal with. Especially since it only seems to happen on about half the flights I take, it's hard to know it's happening until it's too late to avoid a low (even when I deliberately go into a flight on the higher side). Likewise, the reverse issue happens on the backend which has caused some severe highs at the start of a few trips.

1q1dyx7,I hate my pump,"Hello fellow Diabetics,

I just wanted to share my story as I like to read others' stories and hope for some opinions.

I was diagnosed with T1D in March 2025. So, it has been about 9 months with this illness now. I am the kind of guy who accepts things when I need to, so I was, let's say, relaxed about it. My doctors said usually new diabetics end up in the ICU because they notice it too late. I was lucky as Gemini (AI) knew what it was immediately.

Now to the insulin pump. When I read American posts on here, I am often shocked about the health system there. In Germany (where I live), it's different. Public health insurance covers the cost of insulin, CGMs, and the pump (as well as the hospital stay). My doctors, who specialize in diabetes, advised me to stay for 10 days to first teach me how to live with T1D and wait for the pump to arrive. Before that, they gave me a choice and explained both pens and pumps. I was like: ""I want the pump, of course! Much easier! No needles, just the app!"" Oh boy, was I wrong.

When I was released with the pump, the trouble started. I did everything I was told. I entered everything into the pump: the food, when I ate/drank sugar when my levels were low, etc., for the pump's algorithm. But still, I had low sugar 1 to 3 times a day. Every day. Even after months.

Then the summer holidays came. I am always in Croatia and Center Parcs, so lots of swimming. Impossible with the catheter. So I talked to my doctors, and they said I could use pens for the vacations. I did that, and it was heaven. In the Netherlands (same climate as home but more movement due to swimming and walking), I had ONE low sugar event in 7 days. At home for a week, I had NONE. And in Croatia (completely different climate and way more activity, swimming up to 5h a day), I had only one low every 3 days. Back at home with the pump? 1 to 3 daily again.

On top of that, I was annoyed by battery changes, changing the insulin cartridge, changing the catheter, and the tubing sticking out (everyone sees: ""oh, he has diabetes""), and I was getting stuck everywhere with the tube. Plus, the pump woke me up in the middle of the night beeping ""Insulin only 20 IU left!"" or because of lows.

So, for the sake of my physical and mental health, I put my foot down and told my doctors: ""I want pens!"". I have now used up the rest of my pump insulin, and in 5 days, I finally get my pens. I hope to have good sugar levels and restful nights again, just like on my holiday.

I know that medically, the pump is usually considered better, but I believe that with the frequent lows and comfort issues, it makes sense for me to switch. What are your thoughts?",1767298821.0,14,57,diabetes_t1,diabetes

Pre-workout food: 20-30g of carbs, like Apple + Almond Butter, sometimes paired with a fast acting sugar to get an initial boost and to spread out coverage. Wait 30 mins.

Exercise: Cardio, \~30 mins

Low glucose: Around the 20/25 minute mark, my levels will dip significantly and I’ll start veering sharply towards a low.

End of workout: I stop, and within 5-10 mins my levels starts to spike up (I assume from the pre-snack). (This last part doesn’t happen all the time, but is probably a 50-50 split).

Dr looking at my 90 day Dexcom Clarity report. See's a 3 day period of lows at approx same time (3pm @ work). Then starts to say maybe we should use a sliding scale for Basal insulin,based on glucose at bed, and make adjustments for morning injection.  I said NO. 2 Reasons. 1. Manufacturers web site mentions when dialing in Basal dose, wait 2, 3 days to change dose so to let body acclimate to new dose. Sliding scale don't allow for this.  2. Lows were work related, never knew what job to be hourly  let alone daily.  Could be sitting at a test bench all day, could be walking back and forth a 16ft table assembling product. Varied day to day.  So said It's easier to adjust Bolus amt or carbs.  Dr. agreed with me.  REAL LIFE vs SNAPSHOT!!!  Then mentions she gets 2 to 4 calls daily to help with bolus adjustments. Dr wants patients to be more self reliant to manage on their own for daily adjustments. Dr even said, ""you live this daily, one should know how to make adjustments.

1pzlklm,My (bad) experience with the Medtronic 780g,"I'm 16M and switched from pens to Medtronic 780g on 21st Dec. And since then, these 10 days have been HELL for me. I absolutely HATE the pump.

I do like the auto-correction algorithm and the pump's design. But the amount of issues I've had with this pump just cancels all the good things about it.

The first issue was infusion site failures. I tried all possible sites, taking extreme care all the time, and still most of them failed. I had to apply 6 infusion sets in these 10 days, and I could only get 2 of them to work. All others caused the ""insulin flow blocked"" error to come. The ones that worked were not smooth. They too gave the same error, but somehow worked. 

No matter how much I tried to contact Medtronic service, they couldn't figure out what the issue was. This flow block error caused me to have constant highs and deeply impacted my TIR.
Then, even when one infusion site worked, the sensor started giving errors. Honestly, Guardian 4 is a PIECE OF SHIT. First you have to do this extremely complicated process of applying it, then it has 2 hours of warmup, and half of the sensors literally don't work. I had to apply 3 sensors in these 10 days. None of them lasted the full 7 days. 

And this is not user error at all. I had all these infusion sites and sensors applied by someone from Medtronic. And still all these errors. I was bolussing from my own half of the time, because the shitty pump just wouldn't work because of the ""insulin flow block"".

And now that my 10-day trial period is going to end, I've decided to drop the pump and go back to pens. This pump is such a headache for me. Like, other type 1 diabetics using this pump said their experience with the pump was quite good. But in my case, I've had numerous unexplained errors.
Using pens is better than this whole pump shenanigans. Did any of you experience something like this?

TL;DR: I had a lot of unexplained issues with the 780g pump, and decided to drop it after the trial.

I’m talking about the universally accepted rules and guidelines that doctors recommend for managing diabetes: how to treat hypos, carb counting, correction and insulin sensitivity factors. For many, these work. For me, they don’t.

Doctors see me as a model patient: A1Cs in the non-diabetic range with fairly limited hypos. But they are ignorant of the blood, sweat, tears, and sheer hope it takes when these tools don’t work for you.

What frustrates me most is that endocrinologists don’t seem to get it: these tools don’t work for me, not because I’m “bad at it,” but because they genuinely don’t produce results. Doctors endlessly tweak my pump’s insulin settings or change the ratios, but whether the changes are small or large, they barely make any difference in my glucose control.

My diabetes management method is far from ideal. I’m completely drained, and I honestly have no idea how it could be done any other way.

1pyjr30,Why is no one talking about the trauma carried by non-diabetic children to type 1 diabetic parents?,"\*\*\*Please excuse the very poor title I chose. In hindsight I realise I should not have posted this here. 

I was born in 1995 and my Mum was diagnosed 3 years later with type 1 at the age of 39 (very late I know). This was back when CGM was not a thing and research was still fairly poor so my Mum was not managing her diabetes very well- she had hypos all the time.  Fearing, trying to anticipate and witnessing these bad episodes and helping her through them was a huge part of my childhood and even into my late teens before I left for university (which I was anxious about because what if she had a hypo, didn't realise, and no one was there to find her and help her).

We were both talking recently because she thought she saw a post about the trauma held by the children of diabetics and asked me about it. I tried googling it but all that comes up is the trauma of parents with diabetic children. Obviously both are valid, but I wonder anyone can point me towards any studies on the effects of T1 on non-diabetic children who essentially acted as caregivers to their diabetic parents? Or if anyone can simply relate?

1pyigaf,What if the biggest problem with Type 1 Diabetes was its name? A proposal to end the stigma.,"Hello everyone,

I'm writing this because after talking a lot with a great friend who lives with type 1 diabetes, we realized something fundamental: the word ""Diabetes"" is broken. Popular culture has filled it with prejudices, blame, and myths that are not only tiresome but also endanger patients.


When people hear ""Diabetes,"" they think of ""excess sugar"" or ""bad habits."" But type 1 diabetes is something completely different. It's an autoimmune battle, a relentless, manual management of metabolism.


That's why we've started experimenting with a change in language. Instead of saying ""Type 1 Diabetes,"" we call it:

Autoimmune Insulin Deficiency.


Why this name?


It's clinically accurate: It defines the origin (autoimmune attack) and the consequence (lack of a vital hormone).

It eliminates guilt: No one is to blame for having a ""deficiency."" It takes the candy and cake jokes off the table.

It clarifies the urgency: In an emergency, saying ""I have an insulin deficiency"" sounds much more serious and technical than ""I'm diabetic,"" which helps people feel less afraid to give sugar if they see hypoglycemia.

The result of the experiment: My friend has started using this term in his social circle. The result? People have stopped making ignorant jokes. Some are still confused, but that confusion opens the door to a real explanation, not automatic prejudice. He feels more respected and, above all, less mentally burdened.


Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is not ""version A"" of another disease. It is a unique life condition that deserves a name that commands respect and clarity.


I'd love to know what you think: * Do you believe that changing the name would help reduce the stigma you experience daily?


Do you feel that the word ""diabetes"" weighs more heavily on you than it should?


Let's make science and respect triumph over ignorance.


An important clarification: We are not saying that changing the name to ""Insulin Deficiency"" will cure the disease or magically improve glucose levels on its own. What we are saying is that this change directly helps patients with self-acceptance and reduces societal prejudice. Biology is managed with medicine, but stigma is combated with language. A patient who feels respected and understood has much more mental strength to face the day-to-day challenges of their treatment.

""Historically, we already went from 'Juvenile Diabetes' to 'Type 1 Diabetes' because the previous name was inaccurate. Today, the current name remains imprecise because it conflates us with a different pathology and burdens us with prejudice. It's time to take the next logical step towards Autoimmune Insulin Deficiency.""",1767002319.0,0,44,diabetes_t1,diabetes

Thankfully, I'd stopped to do some shopping and had a six pack of boxed blackcurrant juice drink. I had one and thought that would be enough. 

Nope. I realized that I was still dipping low. I grabbed my glucose tablets and had about four of them, but I'm still I'm driving. I realized I was out of my head, was a danger to myself and others, and pulled over. 

I have a system, so I grabbed another juice, chugged it, and set a timer for 10 minutes. I played a mobile game while waiting and talking myself down. Over the years, I also get scared when I have bad lows, so I knew to just talk myself through it: 

* ""It's okay."" 
* ""You've caught it and treated it."" 
* ""You've set a timer."" 
* ""Just let it work."" 
* ""You pulled over."" 
* ""You're safe.""

When it comes to the Novorapid doses, every single one has to go down by at least 4. The Tresiba varies a lot, sometimes I don't even have to touch it.

This effect (or whatever it is) kicks in the second I get to my grandparents house, and stops the second I get home.

Just today, I got home, increased my already decreased dose by only 3, and my sugar skyrocketed. Even though the sugar was fine if not low with the decreased dose.

I really don't have a singular clue as to what could cause this. 

Physical activity doesn't cause this. Even if I don't do anything all day, doses still have to be lowered. While I do walk more when I'm there, there's also days where I don't do anything.

A year or so ago, (when I was much fatter, and my doses were a lot higher) I would still have to lower by about 4, but this didn't seem like much of a difference since my doses were about 30-40. Today, all of my doses are under 15 (except for Tresiba) and i still have to lower by about 4.

1pxxzi5,Insulin absorption/action during running/intensive cardio,"What is your blood sugar like when you do intense cardio if you’ve taken insulin < 5 hours ago?

For me it’s so crazy. Insulin action becomes EXPLOSIVE when I start running. Some examples of what happens with me:
1. I can be at 300mg/dl. I’ll take 2 units of insulin as correction before starting my run (normally if I weren’t going to exercise the correction dose would’ve been much higher). Within 30-45 minutes, my blood sugar would have dropped from 300mg/dl to 100mg/dl. 
2. I could have taken insulin for my meal 3-4 hours ago. I would drop ~50 to 100 mg/dl after starting my run. 
3. A more concrete example. I had a particularly embarrassing binge recently where I ate an entire Ben and Jerry’s pint of ice cream on two consecutive days (yes I have an ED but that’s not the point of this post so won’t get into it). A pint is about 130g carbs and 90g sugar. On day 1, I took around 15 units of insulin (no exercise) and I shot up to 300mg/dl but eventually came down after hours. On day 2, I ate the second pint and took around 8 units of insulin and went for a run. Of course, my BG dropped crazy fast and went low. To treat the low during my run I had 6 sugar crackers and 600ml juice. And yet by the end of my run I was still 80mg/dl.
4. If I have absolutely NO (rapid acting - I use injections) insulin on board (i.e. last dose was > 6 hours ago), then blood sugar *increases* anywhere between 0-50mg/dl during the run. 

I guess I am just shocked by the effect intense cardio has on insulin absorption/action. It’s quite scary.

(I run anywhere between 7-15kms. I’m a fairly weak fragile girl and my heart rate goes quite high during these runs, if that makes any difference.)

1pxwnkr,Relatability as a T1,"Before I make this short post, I wanted to caviat with understanding there’s a myriad of factors that can make managing T1 different for different folks.

My main observation however, is that social media would have you believe managing T1 is nigh on impossible. “I can never get a single night sleep” “I’m always high” I’m always low” I have to think about 1million things per day” etc etc. now…when I first got diagnosed (at 34), in dka), I searched the internet night and day and implemented within the first month about 5-10 different diets whilst trialling many different foods. After some time I landed on Bernstein and whilst not strictly adhering to his protocols, I’m mostly low carb high protein and combine weight lifting/ exercising to manage.

I probably go low one/ twice a month and usually very very mild and I’ll barely ever go above 6.5mmol after a meal.

I do wonder (and I blame the doctors here) if certain diets were help supported, if the stigma and horrible rehabilitating nature of T1 would be vastly different. I believe far far less complications would exist and families feeling empowered to change their kids/ family around them would be a game changing aura to have.

Again not saying managing t1 is a total walk in the park, but my own experience is that 95% of the time I feel powerful to be able to control my own blood sugars and be as healthy if not healthier than my non diabetic piers.

I’ve now spent the last 2 years post diagnosis with an a1c between 4.7-5.3 and believe in the next 10 years we’ll see tools to make managing t1 even easier.

I was diagnosed when I was really young, basically spent my entire childhood in an endo office. I’m in uni now so it’s been about fifteen years and I don’t remember what it was like to not have diabetes. And I’m completely burnt out thinking about how I’m just expected to deal with this for the rest of my life. 
My blood sugars tend to be higher, but especially these past few months they’ve been running high. I had a rhythm down for them to not spike incredibly high at uni but now I’m home for the holidays and they’re all over the place. I’ve got an endo appointment coming up and I’m just dreading being scolded again for something I already know. And switching from a pediatric endo was so jarring because what do you mean I have to get bloods done every three months now?? My pediatric endo would do it by finger prick. 
I was never scared of needles before, but for whatever reason within the last year I’ve developed a fear of them. I now struggle to change sites, dexcom, especially have an issue with getting bloods done.

past couple of months haven’t been able to pre bolus, if I take the insulin and haven’t started eating yet I freak out - “what if I don’t like my food?” “what if I suddenly feel nauseous and can’t eat?” “what if I throw up?” 
Even with my usual breakfast which I eat every damn day, if I try to bolus before I eat I just panic and cancel the bolus until I’ve eaten a bit of the food.  Even then I only take about half of what I need, then the other half after. 
It feels like a vicious cycle because I get anxious and then have low appetite and then try to eat and then pump corrects me then (If I’m at work for example) I’ll start going low and then I freak out and so I eat sweets but probably too much and then pump reads my sugars rising really quickly then corrects but corrects too much because bloods start coming down anyways due to high GI of sweets etc. etc. 
I just want to do normal young adult things and I feel like I can’t because of this stupid disease!!! Also I don’t know what happened! This has never really been an issue before! 

tldr: I panic after taking insulin, thinking I won’t be able to eat my food

1pxp56o,Help for sporting purpose,"Hello everyone 
I have recently (beginning of december) been diagnosed with t1d. I´ve been playing football since I was 6 year old, currently 19 year old. I am a goalkeeper and with the recent diagnoses I became worried that I can´t play the game anymore. I havent trained since the diagnosis. I currently have a sensor (dexcom one+), and I was wondering if some people had any tips & tricks on how to manage games and practices. Do you keep your Phone near you or not? On what bloodsugar level do you not sport?

My doctor said it is fine. But I am worried because I have the sensor on my arm and because I´m a goalkeeper it is going to malfunction or brake when I´m diving. Should I start by trying as an outfield player for a few weaks and so how this goes?
They explained to me that it is important to drink an isotonic drink (eg. Powerade) and afterwards eat one carbohydrate portion. Is this correct info or have i misunderstood.

On another note, I am someone who once or twice a week goes to the gym. And my doctor said that the blood sugar could rise because of the body being under stress while weightlifting. They suggested ding cardio for about 20 minutes after an hour of lifting. How do people who go to the gym manage this? And what if you pass out. Is someone aware that you have t1d or not?

At this moment I have only done cardio (20-30 minutes of running) but I would like to pick up my old habbits. And my insuline reacts quite strongly on the activity. Hence the question.

I’ve had T1D for more than 30 years and I’m trying to unravel some relationship stuff. Maybe it’s related, maybe not. Physically, I’m basically complication-free which is lucky. Emotionally, I’m a mess. I don’t know if that’s related, but my therapist suggested finding other T1D and see if they can relate.

My therapist thinks I have complex PTSD which overlaps a lot with borderline personality disorder. She recommended starting an antidepressant and my psychiatric provider fixated a lot on the BPD tendencies. I don’t deny my moods are intense, but I don’t totally get it either. They recommended finding a support group but I haven’t found one in my small city.

Also, I didn’t think of my youth with T1DM as traumatizing but my therapist pointed out I share many tendencies with SA survivors (fortunately, this hasn’t happened to me). She pointed out that being held down for injections daily and forced to adhere to a diet could cause similar feelings.

Also, I know dropping blood sugars give me jitters and affect my sleep afterwards even if the numbers look good.

Hello everyone! I just want to start off by saying I am still learning about Type 1 Diabetes and I apologize in advance if my post comes off as offensive or uninformed. I am open to being taught anything I am incorrect about!

My little sister is 16 and two weeks ago she went into DKA, this is how we learned she has Type 1 Diabetes. After being life flighted, she is now stable and home and even back to school! 

My sister lives at home with my mom and step dad, I live about 2 hours away from them. So i’m not there to help her and learn what to do in case of emergencies, and i’m not super knowledgable yet about Diabetes (I am trying to read and learn, and I am open to any helpful resourced anyone may have.)

My question is, her birthday is coming up in February and I would like to get her a gift that may ease the process for her or be helpful with managing the day to day requirements for her to keep track of her blood sugar or I don’t know, something that can help make her life easier? Also, any really yummy snacks or food I can get her so she feels more like a “normal” (her words) teenager but won’t put her at risk. 

Basically, what would you have liked to know and have when you first found out you had Type 1 Diabetes? What are some great finds that improved your life (even if its just a really yummy snack!)

He wears a CGM (dexcom g7) and an insulin pod so he is usually within target range for his blood sugars as it's easily tracked and adjusted.

Thank you to everyone for all your advice!!💕

I spoke to him previously but he didn't say much on it he seemed a little uncomfortable at the time.

We spoke again today and he elaborated that he was only worried about his new cgm as it kept disconnecting, and he didn't want to disconnect while sleeping or something. Him and his mum resolved it and its working now!

I've still taken on board the advice from you all, the only family i live with is my mother and she's fairly understanding of his situation as she herself was diabetic while pregnant with me and again with my brother and her mother too is diabetic, so any dietary restrictions or specifications he may have are not at all an issue. He'll be coming over in a few days with an emergency kit (backup pods, insulin, ect). We have been together long enough i already know what snacks he likes if hes going low or into hypo, and what he likes to avoid if trying to avoid hyperglycaemia.

1pwdemy,Abbott Instinct,"On medtronic 780g and just got the new software and Instinct last week after being on the Guardian 3/4 system for years. Just curious to hear from any Abbott users (as I am learning that the Insinct is just a rebranded Libre) who’ve used it with a hybrid closed loop system if it’s very sensitive or if I just potentially have a bad sensor or something. 

I ask bc I’ve been a diabetic for almost 35 years and I generally know best practices (aka don’t need diet/exercise advice) and try my best to not overindulge for the holidays to avoid spikes/drops. But a week into my first instinct sensor, my graph has been constant peaks and valleys for days now. Generally not getting above mid 200’s but frequent ‘rapid rise’ warnings (two arrows up) even after not eating anything and/or after sufficiently bolusing for what I did eat, then dropping to 50’s-60’s before starting the pattern again. Also has been happening overnights when I am used to a much more ‘straight line’ overnight esp when I’m not eating before bed. My TIR has been around 75-80% but sure hasn’t felt like it. 

I’m going to call medtronic to see what’s up as maybe it’s a bum sensor and/or since it’s my first time that the algo just isn’t dialed in yet. But it’s been hella frustrating and exhausting to have these rapid swings so I figured I’d reach out to the community to see if it’s just me or if anyone has had any similar experiences with the instinct or other Abbott cgms.

I’m wondering if there are other women here who experience this too.

A few days before my period, I eat carbs, dose insulin like I normally would, but my blood sugar still spikes really high — sometimes up to 270–300 mg/dL. This happens even though nothing else has changed (same food, same insulin, same routine).

Is this something you experience as well?

1pw2raj,"9 years,1 month, 7 days ago...","Hello everybody, I just wanted to share that it's been exactly 9 years,1 month and 7 days since I was diagnosed with this disease, which has been living inside me for this long. I was only 4 years old when I was admitted and diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.. my blood glucose was really really high (526mg/dL) but thankfully I was not in DKA because I had enough residual insulin to prevent the buildup of ketones.

Out of those 9.1 years. 8.8 years were managed by my parents, which ultimately caused a estimated hb1ac of 10.6% 
And once I got the dosing under my hands 
I went from 
10.6% —> 6.7% in 3.5 months without my endo for 4 years and eyeballing meals 
All under my efforts. Because I had been observing patterns for the past 3 years.
Btw I use regular insulin,basal  and finger pricks only.
I cut my highs from 85% —> 30% 

Bonus points: I haven't missed a single shot in 9.1 years, that's why I didn't require the necessity to carry ketones strips or let alone buy them.

I know the disease sucks, but it's a disease of brain power 
So this is what I want you take away:
1) diabetes is a disease of trial and error at first but thankfully moving forwards it feels suprisingly easy idk why 💀💀💀
2) If you ever get burned out, please please don't miss your insulin. You don't wanna risk your life for a burnout. I respect when people burnout, but atleast don't miss your basal and bolus.
3) if you are a teenager. Please see your endo often because insulin needs change very frequently in diabetes.
4) mental health matters as much as physical health, so you are allowed to break, it doesn't make you weak or anything crazy.
5) It's okay to have one meal where you don't have to over think about carbs or perfectly dosing. Just do the dose which you feel like will work. (Just make sure to monitor later!)

Fearing you took too little of a dose. Even now since I just got a pump, I fear it more. Like I don’t care about the lows, but the highs worry me. I’m almost 40 and those complications are not too far along if I get those.

I’m on a pump and CGM, but I can’t seem to get my A1C below 7—my last check a week ago was 7.5.

After the near death experience I had, it feels like I’m no longer taking care of myself and instead I’m just resetting the death clock every time I give myself a dose of insulin or eat something to prevent a low blood sugar. I’m also realizing how much of my childhood has been taken away from me by this horrific disease. So much anxiety and depression throughout my life has mostly stemmed from this and I feel like it’s holding me back from what I want to do. I feel like I’ve missed out on so many opportunities to make friends as a kid because I was too worried about taking care of myself and now I have nobody my age that I can call my friend other than my roommates. There’s just this thick pane of glass between me and everyone else and I’m just watching everyone I grew up with find their partners and have fun with their friends. It’s also affecting my ability to interact with my family, I feel like I no longer enjoy doing things with them because I’m so lost. All the years of taking care of type one diabetes has slowly chipped away my brain and I’m just now realizing how much of my life has been taken from me. Don’t get me wrong I still love my family, it’s just hard to do anything when you’re this burnt out. I should be in college getting my degree and working on going to nationals in diving, but instead I’m taking a break from all of it. There’s just too much going on inside of my head and I can’t take it anymore.
There’s nobody else at my college who has this and I feel so fucking alone and I’m missing out on what’s supposed to be some of the best years of adulthood. I want to be able to find someone to love, I want to make friends, and I want to be able to have fun with my family again but this burnout is so horrible and is driving me crazy. It’s getting to a point where I’m struggling to find reasons to be alive. I’m not going to kill myself or stop taking care of my diabetes, but the stress of this is ruining my life.

From what I’ve read, it seems that its characterised by the pancreas still functioning “on its last legs” and still producing random spurts of insulin that leads to easier glucose control but also more erratic patterns?

I’ve been noticing that even with very regular daily routines there have been days where the usual patterns just get totally derailed (random lows and spikes seemingly out of nowhere), or that the “usual” pattern shifts as time goes by

Is this something one would expect to experience during this period? And how long did your honeymoon periods last? Does life get more stable once it passes?

And any tips on navigating through the unpredictability of this period?

1pubm0c,Looking for sleep advice,"Hello everyone!

I've been diagnosed as T1 roughly a month ago at the age of 31 (BG 500, DKA, the whole works), and since then, sleeping became incredibly difficult.

Now I was never the perfect sleeper, and as long as I could remember, I always had my sleep cycle shifting forward an hour or so at a time, which ended up with me constantly ""cycling"" my sleep. 

While I never figured out the exact reason, I have a feeling that it's anxiety-related (often feel sort of a ""dread"" feeling if I have to force myself to sleep at a time I'm practically not passing out from tiredness), and as you might expect, my anxiety only got worse as a result of my T1D diagnosis, to the point where I started randomly waking up and practically breaking down screaming, shaking, running around the house, etc. like I've completely lost the plot. 

Usually, I actually end up sleeping a few minutes after this happens, and I end up having a very faint memory of what exactly happened the next day, as in, I can't recall the whole event, but only bits and pieces.

Even though I feel like I've been handling my condition decently so far, mostly thanks to regular weight training (and perhaps honeymooning?), with a 30 day average of 90% in tight range (70-140), not being able to sleep properly started affecting my ability to work out, which in turn started throwing my sugars off as well.

Long story short, I feel like it all comes down to being able to sleep well, which is why I would highly appreciate any advice on how I can just get a good night's sleep as a newly-diagnosed T1D, and anything else that could be related to what I'm experiencing.",1766541754.0,2,3,diabetes_t1,diabetes

1ptz5v0,Im so tired of this disease,"18 year old, Male. Been suffering from Type 1 Diabetes since I was 13. For the past few days I’ve been hitting many hypoglycemic episodes and just recently I’ve reached 39 mg/dl. The crazy part is that it usually is never like this. I either inject 14-16 units of Humalog 50/50 depending on how many carbs I’ll eat and the amount of glucose I have before breakfast. I ate cake the night before because it also happened to be low so I expected it to be high again by morning. 

And so I do my usual routine. Injecting 16 units, eating breakfast (brown rice and eggs). It felt normal for a while until it went lower than I thought it would go (39 mg/dl). Usually it shouldnt go this low. Sometimes it would stay at 200 but today was just different. I ended up eating four mini donuts and one piece of cake to raise it up again.

My hypothesis is that it’s because of the constant physical activity I’ve done for the past week. I did not have a single rest day and some days I barely had any sleep. So now I assume my muscles are very sensitive and need a lot of glucose to repair itself. 

Now Im no professional. Im not sure if my hypothesis is correct. I really want clarification, advice, and reassurance because Im honestly scared. This was my lowest so far and I thought I was going to die. Ofc this wasn’t the only time. Im just stressed at this point, having to deal with these hypoglycemic episodes because of how bad I am at “predicting”.

I am almost 30 years old and have been T1D for 6 and a half years, but on many days I still get myself anxious when dosing a decent amount of insulin with my meals. I am on MDI and have been for almost all of my time as a diabetic. 

  
I have developed some relatively bad habits with bolusing where I am pretty afraid to prebolus in general: usually will bolus while eating but sometimes could wait up to 30+ min after eating depending on how quickly my blood sugar rises. I also usually err on the side of slightly less insulin over slightly more insulin (I will say I religiously walk so that helps counteract a rising BS). 

  
Even while writing this post, I got anxious cause after eating breakfast, my sugar went from 181 (rising) to 195 to 196 and then I thought 'oh crap, maybe I gave too much and it's going to come crashing down' when the next reading happened to be 224. 

  
It makes it hard to fathom there a diabetics who will aggressively give a prebolus 10-20 min BEFORE eating all while their glucose is a steady 78. Meanwhile I feel uneasy about bolusing with a post-meal rising sugar at 150. My A1Cs have been consistently low 6's so I am not overly concerned there (though I always strive to be under 6 if possible).

1ptwnqt,Painful hard lumps at every insulin pump site — has anyone else experienced this?,"Hi everyone — hoping to tap into the community’s experience here.

I’ve now tried insulin pump therapy twice, about 15 years apart, and I’m seeing the exact same problem both times.

What happens:

	•	Mild discomfort when a new infusion site is placed

	•	Pain increases the longer the site is worn

	•	After removal, the area becomes more painful and very tender

	•	A hard, firm lump forms exactly where the cannula was

	•	This has happened at every site, across different body areas

This time I’ve only been pumping for about a week and used 3 sites total, and it’s already happening again — which is why I had to stop pump therapy years ago.

There’s no obvious infection (no spreading redness, no fever). It slowly improves once the site is rested, but repeats with the next one and takes multiple weeks for the site to fully clear. 

Relevant details:

	•	Novolog during my first pump attempt (\~15 years ago)

	•	Humalog now

	•	Straight-in soft cannula (Celo 90)

	•	Pain worsens with dwell time, peaks after removal

My care team says this “isn’t normal,” but no one can really explain why it keeps happening.

I’m genuinely trying to figure out whether this is:

	•	a rare intolerance to continuous subcutaneous infusion

	•	a mechanical/cannula issue

	•	something insulin-related

	•	or just an edge case that doesn’t get talked about much

Questions for the community:

	•	Has anyone had reproducible painful inflammatory reactions at pump sites?

	•	Did switching insulin formulations help?

	•	Did shortening site wear time make a difference?

	•	Did anyone ultimately decide pumps just weren’t compatible with their body?

I’m not anti-pump — I really want this to work — but this has been consistent across years and attempts, and I’m trying to understand whether I’m truly an outlier.

I’ve been on a Tandem t:slim pump for about 8 months, using Fiasp. Over the last couple of months, I’ve noticed a recurring issue: as I get close to changing my infusion set, insulin effectiveness drops significantly.

As you know, infusion sets are changed every 3 days. By the end of day 3, or when the cartridge gets down to around 20 units left, my blood sugars suddenly become very hard to control. I mostly eat the same foods, and this happens consistently with those last meals before a site change.

I don’t think it’s a clog. When I detach the set and deliver a test bolus, insulin comes out normally. Same thing when I remove the cannula and deliver insulin, no blockage. I’ve even drawn the remaining insulin from the cartridge and injected it with a syringe, and it works just fine. 

So the insulin itself seems okay, but delivery through the site at that point doesn’t seem effective.

1ptbd49,Denied Ozempic and Don’t know what to do,"My partner is a type one diabetic with BAD insulin resistance. Days where they can’t get their blood sugar below 300. We’re in the US for context.

They tried everything. Diet, excersize, lifestyle changes, multiple types of insulin, sleep changes, and metformin. None of it’s made it better except metformin… which stopped working about six months ago. Even if it did work, it leaves them with horrible, painful diarrhea that has them waking up multiple times a night, and they have to use the max dosage.

Finally, the doctor gave them a sample of Ozempic. And that was it. That worked! It worked perfectly! They went days without going high. It’s not shocking, their family has a history of type two.

One problem. Insurance denied it. Even after they appealed. Didn’t matter. According to insurance, the FDA didn’t recommend it. And they already had metformin, so cleaaarly they’re covered. We tried for weight loss too but they realized we were trying to get it for the BG issues and denied it.

I guess what I’m trying to say is: what are the options? Does anyone else have this experience? The doctor recommended trying over the counter GLP-1s, but they’re concerned it will be like Walmart insulin. Watered down or dangerous or hard to predict. Are there good over the counter companies we could consider?

Edit to add:
They have an insulin pump, but their insulin resistance is still crazy high and getting worse every year.
They take the maximum amount of insulin, going through vials in half a week.
They currently use humolog
They tried the new fast acting insulin (the one that takes 2 minutes to absorb instead of 20) but it caused a nasty allergic reaction that had them crying nightly from how much pain they were in. Stopped that one quick.

1pt7o49,"Surviving quietly, four needles at a time","

I don’t usually write things like this I tend to keep it to myself. But today, it felt like I could finally put these thoughts somewhere outside my head. Maybe because someone can listen without judging me to my face, and I don’t think I can handle that anymore. Writing feels safer than explaining. This is me speaking where I won’t be interrupted or pitied.

I was ten when my life quietly split into a before and an after. Before, my days were careless and loud; after, they were measured in units and needles. Four injections a day morning, afternoon, evening, night every single day. At first it hurt in the obvious way, the sting, the bruises, the flinch I tried to hide. Then it hurt in the invisible way, the kind that settles into your bones. Over time, I adjusted. Muscle memory took over. I learned how to do it quickly, how to smile while doing it, how to say “it’s fine” and almost believe it. And most days, it really is fine. I hate being pitied more than I hate the injections themselves. I don’t want soft voices or sad eyes or people telling me how “strong” I am, because I didn’t choose this strength I just woke up one day and had no other option. But there are moments, small and cruel, when I end up pitying myself, and that’s what breaks me. Standing in a bathroom stall during an important event, counting seconds instead of enjoying the moment. Saying no to things I want to do because my body has rules I didn’t write. Watching life happen in real time while I pause it to hurt myself on purpose just to survive. That’s the part I don’t know how to make peace withthat the thing I hate the most is also the thing keeping me alive, and that no matter how “used to it” I get, it still steals from me. It steals spontaneity, ease, and sometimes joy. I don’t want sympathy, and I don’t want to be called brave. I just want one day where my body doesn’t interrupt my life, and where surviving doesn’t feel like something I have to earn with pain.",1766429651.0,34,11,diabetes_t1,diabetes

Been on a pump since I was 18, been using OmniPod 5 in automated mode for the last 2 years and haven’t had much of an issue with it until recently. Maybe it’s because I had a baby 8 months ago, maybe it’s because I’m breastfeeding, maybe it’s because I’ve lost all the baby weight and then some, maybe it’s a combination of all those things, but all of a sudden this pump has been sending me into DANGEROUS lows. Automated mode worked well for me before pregnancy, and during pregnancy, and immediately postpartum it was also fine, but now it seems like it’s trying to actively kill me lol (laughing so I don’t cry). And let me tell you I have tried EVERYTHING to try and fix this with no success. I raised my ISF from 50, to 75, then to 100, then, 125, and so forth, and this pump was still so aggressively treating even very minor rises in blood sugar to the point I was absolutely crashing a few hours later. Like I’ve been afraid to sleep at night because of this. And when I say crashing, I mean it’s got me dropping 100 points in 20-30 mins crashing. Endo is scratching his head over this and I’ve been tested for any obvious things that might make me suddenly more sensitive to insulin (spoiler alert everything was normal). It also seems like the pump’s algorithm is faulty or just plain wrong. If I have my ISF set at 150 with a target blood sugar of 140 overnight, why in the hell did it take it upon itself to give me 1.75 units for a blood sugar of 275? That’s the correct amount for a target of 125, not 140, just saying. I am normally SO well controlled (a1c before all this was always between 5.5-6.5) but the way I’ve been struggling I’m sure it’s awful now. I finally gave up and switched to manual mode and so far that’s been a game changer and is working so much better for me. I guess my question is has anyone else just been totally unable to use automated mode? Like it just flat out doesn’t work for them?

I am 48 years old. My BMI is 18, I exercise, and I have always followed a low-carb diet.

What bothers me a lot is:
I have periods when I hardly need any insulin; sometimes I can stop basal insulin and stay between 5–8 mmol/L if I eat very few carbohydrates; then other times when 5–10 g of carbohydrates causes my blood sugar to spike to 10–12 mmol/L.

For the past month, I have only occasionally taken Novorapid for rich meals. My weight is stable.

I’m currently using Insulin Aspart (Sanofi) as my standard bolus insulin. Unfortunately, the results have been pretty disappointing.

Especially in the morning, the insulin response is extremely poor — I often need almost double the dose, and even then the effect sometimes doesn’t really kick in until hours later.
During the day and evening, it’s slightly better, but still very inconsistent and far from ideal.

For very high glucose levels, I occasionally use Lyumjev, which does bring my numbers down faster. However, it causes strong burning pain at the injection site and I frequently get bruises, so it’s not really suitable for me as a regular bolus insulin.

I’m curious:
	•	What bolus insulins are you using?
	•	Have you experienced poor absorption or delayed action with Aspart?
	•	Did switching to another insulin (e.g. Fiasp, Humalog, etc.) make a noticeable difference?

For example, i fall asleep with 6mmol and 1 hour later in my sleep im with 10+, and i sleep with high bg my whole night. I keep rising the units but maybe that's not the problem. Yesterday i fell alseep without giving myself tresiba, fell asleep with 6.5, woke up with 7.3.. no rise at all, or atleast minimal. I gave myself tresiba this morning and seems like no rise at all again. Maybe i should give myself tresiba in the morning? ",1766303422.0,1,3,diabetes_t1,diabetes
1prsuuj,"T1D for 5+ years, consistent logging / alarm timing were my biggest struggles. Anyone else feel the same?","Hey here,

It's my first post on Reddit, so please don't judge me severely :)

I’ve got t1d bit more than 5 years ago, and I wanted to share something that’s been popping out in my mind more often and ask if it relates to your case as well.

My story is this:  
I have needlephobia (probably not valid anymore). No blood check in past 9 years preceding diabetes suspicion - I had a red flag when I did urine test (easy ofc :D). So when my partner said I should do blood check that was a hard pass. My background is software engineering and I love data, numbers etc, so instead of giving blood from my vein I bought Libre 2 :D as it didn't look as scary to me back then (took me 1h to install mainly due to final moment of pressing applicator 🤦‍♂️ ).  
  
Sadly, data confirmed it with sugars around 17-28mmol/l after which I had to do blood work ofc and got ticket to hospital with DKA :/ and needlephobia therapy ofc - IV drip etc.  
  
I quickly realized that the only way to survive diabetes and keep as normal a life as possible is through data and discipline. And I didn't have a problem with either, but the latter was heavily underestimated by me.

The challenge for me comes mainly through 2 things:   
\- logging events such as insulin, food and activities  
\- constantly shifting alarms to keep 4.2-8.0 as much as I can.

I don't know how one is supposed to log with an app like LibreView - it's totally unusable to me with terrible interface. So I mainly use it for Alarms + reading data.

My glucose in range is between 93-96% mainly because I eat the same stuff on working week and allow x2 eat out or something else on weekends. Every time I don't eat the same stuff I used to -> I almost certainly have a swing out of the range.

So I started to imagine, would it help if I sit and research if there's any tool that could:

* Help me log with my voice instead of typing
* Setting alarms for me based on data
* Have more insights for me to understand what should I fix

Some of my friends mentioned to share my thoughts on Reddit  and I was always sceptical about this, but here I am :)  
  
I'm really into fixing my habits but I'm not sure I'm ready to create my own app, and hopefully, there's a solution already.   
  
So, can you please share your opinion and tell me:  
\- Do you also struggle with logging? Did you find a solution to it?  
\- Do you ""play"" this game with constantly shifting alarms?  
\- What’s the *most annoying friction point* in your daily management?  
\- Are you happy with your Glucose in Range? 

Thanks for reading.",1766276334.0,6,35,diabetes_t1,diabetes
1prslrp,How I Went From A 12.5% A1C to 5.3% in 2 Years,"Exactly 2 years ago on December 19 2023 I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at 20 years of age. I still remember all my friends out eating and I was stuck in the hospital with my world completely flipped upside down. I was diagnosed with an A1C of 12.5% and my most recent blood test shows an A1C of 5.3%. 

For context I am on Trurapi for my quick insulin and Tresiba for my long-acting insulin. I am on pens and have not really considered switching to insulin pumps yet. I am also using the Freestyle Libre 2. My doctors recommended my Dexcom but insurance headaches has led me to stick with Freestyle for now. It can be annoying sometimes with the 10 min stoppages it sometimes has (seems to happen when you really need the sensor too lol) but overall it's been decent. 

I have also made many mistakes such as overcorrecting highs, underestimating carbs in food and thinking I had all this figured out. I have been humbled many times, but this is just some tips I have for a newly diagnosed or just someone who wants some help. 

**The First Month**

The first month is the hardest. I initially thought my world was over with. I thought I would never enjoy life, would never enjoy food, would never be able to play sports, etc. I allowed myself to cry it all out that first week but I quickly realized I am just going to have to deal with it. I gained a lot of weight that first month. I went from about 170lbs to 195lbs in the span of 1 month (6 feet tall). I was also frustrated a lot that first month, constantly asking myself why this happened to me. I am however very thankful for the people at my hospital for all the help they have provided me. You will also have many highs in the first month, don't get frustrated, you will be fine. 

**Initial Frustrations**

I want to say I am very thankful for my parents, but they made that first year so hard. When initially diagnosed my mom kept praying for a miracle to fix me. She constantly wanted me to pray for a fix to my diabetes. She also thought my diagnosis was because of the way I was eating so she basically cut out carbs completely for the first month until I just snapped at her. She still can't watch me give myself a shot lol. My dad once asked my endo if this Dr. Oz pill he saw on Facebook could really cure diabetes. You all know the typical stuff you will hear from those who don't understand. This was honestly the most frustrating part, but just try your best to bear through it, but it won't be easy. 

High blood sugar also does affect mood, I have found myself being angrier and more irritable when high. 

**Food**

I eat whatever I want, I just take the insulin for it. You will figure out your ratios, you will keep mental notes and just get a feel of things. I guesstimate everything but have gotten it pretty spot on now. I'm sure you can use AI and other tools to help as well if you wish. I also want to say though, when I do cut carbs to a certain limit, it helps so much with blood sugar control, and you should really aim to bring carbs down to a reasonable limit if you want best control. It will make your life easier and the numbers will be so nice. You need to put in some work for a good A1C but it is not impossible. 

**Gym**

You will be able to gain so much muscle after diagnosis. You will be naturally gaining weight from finally having insulin running through your body, and I recommend you take advantage of this by going to the gym. 

**Reddit**

This sub reddit has been great at times, but also very depressing at other times (as is reddit in general). I used to be chronically scrolling this subreddit, until I realized that this place really does make you sad and think you are doomed with this disease. Type 1 Diabetes sucks, but it truly is not the end of the world. I recommend you look at reddit for questions when you have them, but please do not get in the habit of constantly reading everyone's sad stories, you will begin to think that your life is over with this disease, it really is not. 

**Info for my Canadians**

If you are in Canada, take advantage of the disability tax credit and the Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP). Call your bank and ask them to open one for you. You will probably need a couple things from your endo but it's easy. It's a very good account where you contribute money yearly and the government matches with grants (up to $3.5k I believe) and may give bonds based on your household income. You can invest this money in mutual funds or other things that your bank allows (I am with CIBC, been good so far). Use this to your advantage. 

**Travel**

Travelling with diabetes has been completely normal. No issues at airports. Bring extra insulin and censors for when you go, and also manual strips. I also had help from this one doctor in the Dominican when I had both my sensors fall off, he was able to provide me with some and kept on checking up on me. He was a great guy. 

**Other Tips**

I wear my sensor on my upper thigh, just a personal choice but I don't like the attention from wearing the sensor on my arm, and this makes me feel normal when outside and not constantly thinking about my diabetes. Works for me, can see why people would be against it but it's just a personal choice, the readings work fine I even talked with my endo about doing it and he was not opposed. 

Don't be scared about how others will think. I thought no girls would ever like me because I am now diabetic, trust me it's not the case you will be fine. 

**TLDR**

2 years post diagnosis, this thing sucks but it's not the end of the world you will be fine. 

If anyone ever has any questions, please feel free to ask or send me a pm, I will be more than happy to help and to be a diabetes buddy. Take care everyone, have a Merry Christmas and a wonderful New Year. ",1766275576.0,15,8,diabetes_t1,diabetes

Just for background I currently take around 5 units of basal a day, no fast acting. Som days when my numbers are bad I take a few units more.

Anyways I assume I will never experience a hypo during cardio with just this basal amount but I deathly scared of going longer in my runs. The park I run at doesn’t have a lot of visitors and I could go low far from others if I go low. I really don’t have any experience with what a low would feel like but I hear stories of t1 just walking on a building and next thing they know they’re in a hospital.

If I start to get tired lightheaded anything I get worried, I’m extra careful because I don’t want my parents to lose 2 sons in a similar way.

I need you guys help in letting me know if their is any real risk of hypo with my 5 units of basal if I start doing hour long or longer runs, also what signs will I notice during my run that will indicate I’m no getting tired, IM GOING LOW.

I'm doing my best to get a job considering the situation being that I'm type 1 diabetic and pregnant, with blood sugars that spike and drop no matter what I do.

Hi everyone,

I’m using the MiniMed Mio Advance infusion set, and I’m hoping to get some advice on where to buy it at a more affordable price.

I live in a developing country, and unfortunately health insurance here does not cover insulin pump supplies. Because of that, the cost of infusion sets is a big financial burden for me when buying locally.

I’m not asking for donations, just looking for:

Online stores with better prices

International pharmacies or medical supply shops that ship abroad

Legitimate alternative suppliers or regions where it’s cheaper

Any tips from people in a similar situation

1prg63d,Trying to rebuild consistency after years of ignoring my health,"For a long time, I didn’t manage my health the way I should have, even though I was told I needed to use insulin.
I avoided tracking, avoided patterns, and mostly reacted only when numbers felt “too high” or when something felt off.
Recently, I’ve been trying to take this more seriously again. One thing that’s become very clear to me is how much context matters. A number by itself doesn’t explain much — timing, meals, missed doses, stress, sleep, all of it completely changes how I interpret a reading.
What I’m struggling with now isn’t lack of information, but consistency and mindset.
I wanted to ask people here:
Do you log consistently, or only during certain periods?
How do you avoid burnout or guilt when numbers aren’t great?
What’s helped you stay engaged without trying to be “perfect” all the time?

1prflly,Managed to get my HBA1c down to 6.6,"I finally got my HbA1c down to 6.6, which I think is the first time I’ve seen a 6 in years. Yay me?

What actually made the difference (at least a bit since I've only recently started doing this) was listening to people on this sub. I’d always been hesitant about using juice for lows because when I was a kid, the ones I tried didn’t seem to help at all. Plus, I basically never drink juice.

Turns out a small juice box goes a long way. It brings my glucose up surprisingly fast, but somehow without sending it out of control. I’ve got my fridge stocked with them now.

The other big change was eating twice a day. I eat once when I wake up, then have another full meal 4–5 hours later (without overeating). If I do get hungry in between, I’ll just grab a banana or a few pretzel pieces.

Honestly, beyond the HbA1c, my blood work looks amazing. My ""bad"" cholesterol is below the minimum range, my ""good"" cholesterol is right in the middle, and my albuminuria is only 10 mg/L, which points to a very minimal protein leak. I’ve had diabetes for almost 19 years, so this feels huge (at least to me). 

For context, I’ve been taking enalapril 10 mg daily for years to protect my kidneys, eyes etc. 

I also don’t want anyone to feel bad about their own control after reading this. I’ve had my HbA1c in the high 8s plenty of times, especially as a teenager. I had to disappoint myself a hundred times before seeing that first real success at try number 101.

And honestly, I don’t think I could’ve done this without the FreeStyle Libre. I’m not saying CGMs deserve all the credit, but probably 50% of it, at least.

1pr32lf,A1c drop from 10.7 to 6.6 in 2.5 months after DKA and helicopter rescue in the Wyoming backcountry,"\*Hi diabuddies! Figured I would share this story of being airlifted out of the backcountry by WY Search and Rescue now that I have a little space from it and my management is under better control. Heads up, its kind of a doozy\*

I was backpacking with my Dad in the Wind River range in SW Wyoming this past August and went into DKA after not bringing enough insulin. This lapse in judgment was the culmination of roughly 8 months of pretty severe diabetic burnout, with very limited active management or control on my end aside from intermittent use of a 10 year old T-Slim. 

For context, I would describe myself as whatever the opposite of a brittle diabetic is (Spongy? Flexible?) that lives a very active lifestyle in western Colorado. Before this event I had never gone into DKA, even when I was diagnosed at 12 fifteen years ago, and I take a relatively low amount of insulin that’s been consistent since my early teens (20 units/day). I think this allowed me to retain some beta cell function, and certainly caused me to become way too relaxed and honestly arrogant with my management. Before this it really felt like I could do whatever to my body and it would be fine. 

Anyway, I f\*\*\*ed up and brought an empty vial of insulin on the trip instead of a full one, and rather than trying to get an emergency prescription filled or changing plans, I basically shrugged and figured I would be fine. Again, this was a major lapse in judgment on my part. 

My dad and I hike pretty hard when it’s just the two of us, and we hiked 15 miles on our first day with 5k ft of vert, most of which was above 10,000 feet. At the end of the first day, I felt slightly more fatigue and shortness of breath than I normally would at that elevation, but chalked it up to feeling the altitude and a big day. 

I woke up the next morning feeling totally normal. I had been without insulin for 72+ hours,  but was monitoring my blood sugar and was hanging out around 180-200. Obviously not ideal, but I was used to being in that range or higher and was honestly not concerned. My dad and I planned to get up at dawn to fish and then hike 7 miles the following day. 

I woke up that morning with mega nausea, but it was like 5:30am and it’s not uncommon for me to feel nauseous that early. We made it down to the lake, but I was feeling gross and I threw up for the first time. At this point I knew I was feeling off, but had been at a conference the week before and figured I had caught some sort of stomach bug. 

I decided to go back to camp, chugged a liter of water with electrolytes and fell back asleep for another few hours. Blood sugar still around 200. After I woke up I ate breakfast, which I didn’t immediately throw up, and my dad and I packed up and got on the trail around 12:30. 

Once I put on my backpack, though, I knew I was in trouble. It truly felt like it weighed 100 pounds, and every step took maximum effort. It took us 40 minutes to walk a mile, and I was completely gassed. When we stopped I threw up some, but not a lot, and was still able to drink water. My dad was obviously concerned at this point, and took some of my weight. We hiked another mile together, but I was continuing to slow down and my breathing started to become very shallow. 

Together we made the decision that he take most of my weight and hike ahead 4 miles to where we planned to camp, where he would drop his pack and come back for me. I would try and get as far as I could without overexerting myself (lol at this now, as that ship had sailed many hours ago). We felt comfortable doing this because we both carry satellite communication devices, and would still be able to contact one another should something go seriously wrong. 

After my dad and I separated is when the wheels fully came off the bus for me. I started to vomit profusely, including all of the fluids and food I had managed to consume that day. I was throwing up every 15-20 minutes, and not keeping any fluids down at all. To make things even more fun it started to thunderstorm with rain and hail, too. 

I became totally focused on putting one foot in front of the other, and remember repeating to myself “people run ultramarathons, you can walk a couple miles” over and over. At one point someone passed me throwing up on the side of the trail and asked if I needed anything, and the only thing I could whimper out through my bile was  “thoughts and prayers” lmao. I was in rough, rough shape, and I think pretty delirious. I hadn’t managed to get my rain gear on fast enough, either, and started to get very cold. 

I finally got to the bottom of a large hill about a mile from my dad and knew I didn’t have the strength to continue. I laid down in the middle of the trail so my dad wouldn’t miss me and started to continually throw up a brown bile from what felt like my small intestine with basically no break in between. I was shivering uncontrollably. I couldn’t tell you how long I was there before my dad got to me, but he made the decision I think as soon as he saw me to initiate an SOS call via his Garmin. It had been roughly 11 hours since I first started feeling weird and throwing up that morning. My dad wrapped me in his layers and my sleeping bag, which helped me warm up, I messaged my wife that we had initiated a rescue, and then was basically fading in and out of sleep and/or consciousness until SAR arrived roughly 3 hours later. 

I am so so thankful my dad was there to communicate with search and rescue (SAR), because I don’t think I would have had the ability to coherently do so if I were alone. I barely knew where I was, let alone having to communicate with 911 dispatch, SAR dispatch, and the SAR crew where I was. Even with my dad doing it, there was still a miscommunication somewhere along the chain and the rescue team thought that I was a 9 year old. They were surprised to rock up and find a 27 year old, instead. I honestly think this helped me get out of the backcountry as fast as I did, so it worked out for the best, but originally I was going to be transported all the way to the pediatric hospital in Salt Lake, which would have been a very long flight and an even longer drive for my dad! 

The SAR helicopter was able to find a place to land right by my spot on the trail, which you can see in the first picture, and my dad and I were loaded up and out of the mountains in about 25 minutes. I still didn’t think I was in DKA (which is so dumb, like ofc I was in DKA, but I blame my delirium) and figured I would just get some fluids via an IV and feel better. The SAR helicopter dropped us off at the Pinedale, WY airport, where a ground and air ambulance were waiting on the tarmac. My dad and I both thought the air ambulance was there for someone else at first, because neither of us really understood how sick I was, I don’t think. Both EMS crews started to work on me once we landed, and I had a bicarb reading of 7 and an anionic gap that was literally off the charts. At this point it started to sink in what rough shape I was in, and I was loaded onto the air ambulance (2nd pic) and flown 100 miles to the hospital in Rock Springs. I was stabilized in the ER overnight, ultimately receiving 9 liters of fluid via IV. I was so dehydrated the only place the hospital could draw blood from was my feet. 

I was discharged the next morning from Rock Springs so that I could drive myself home in order to make an endocrinology appointment I just happened to have scheduled. That drive honestly sucked, and I got major edema in my legs due to sitting for that long after such a large amount of fluid. My potassium levels were super low too due not staying in the hospital long enough, and I ended up back in the ER at home two more times in the next three days to help get that stabilized. It didn’t really hit me how dangerous a position I had put myself in until about a week later, and that was a pretty sobering moment tbh. 

All in all, it took me about three weeks to feel myself again, and has been a major wake up call about the way I had been taking care of my diabetes. Since August I updated my TSlim and got onto a closed loop system with the G7 (I met all my deductibles and out of pocket maximums with the emergency care) and have managed to get my A1c down to 6.6 with 87% TIR. Plus my eyes are still looking good per my optometrist and my kidney function doesn’t seem to have been impacted by exerting myself as much as I did while in DKA. 

Anyhoo, that’s my story of getting to go on two helicopter rides in one day and almost dying in the backcountry. Cheers if you made it this far.

1pqzz91,Help Understanding Dexcom/Omnipod Out of Pocket Costs with Kaiser Permanente Insurance (in VA),"Hello! I currently use a platinum level, $0 deductible Kaiser plan purchased through the VA health insurance marketplace (basically the same as healthcare.gov).  It will cost me $565/month for the premium next year.  I use this plan mainly because this plan fully covers the cost of diabetes medical supplies, so I pay no copay/co-insurance for my Dexcom/Omnipod5 supplies or needles.  However, the premium is pretty high, and I’m not getting the subsidies that are provided with a “silver” level plan thru the marketplace.

For anyone else on one of these plans through Kaiser, what plan do you use, what is your premium, and what do you pay out of pocket for Dexcom and/or Omnipod 5 supplies?  I’m wondering if it would make sense to switch to a plan with a cheaper premium next year, but I don’t know what to expect for the costs of those/whether a lower premium plan would actually save me money..

1pqvsrr,So tired of Abbott Freestyle Libre sensor issues 😞,"I am just…so frustrated. Managing T1D is hard enough and the one small convenience I’ve come to rely on is a sensor I can check without having to deal with constant finger pricking to stay on top of my blood sugar. It’s enough that I’m paying $80 per month on 2 Libre 3 Plus sensors (thankfully I have insurance, but still not something I enjoy spending so much on each month). 4 out of 5 of my recent sensors have been faulty. Even my current one (allegedly not part of the recalled run) is 50-100 points off from my actual blood sugar when I prick. As I write this it is 80 points off; and before anyone comes at me, I’m putting on a new one in the morning. However, having to travel internationally for 10 days with 3 sensors just in case 2 breakdown is absurd.)

For the record, I do my best to manage without relying on just a sensor. I was diagnosed with an 11.9 A1C a year ago and I’m down to 5.9 now with MDI. I’m not trying to shirk any responsibility for managing my own health. I just don’t typically like to spend so much money on a product with this kind of failure rate. I know no sensor is perfect and I could try Dexcom, which I may have to do at this point; it’s just another thing on top of all the other things, you know?

I guess it would just be nice if Abbott could make it seem like they care at all—not only about this latest 3m sensor recall with some kind of genuine, human response—but even in some general capacity about products they bring to market and charge a premium for critical health management.

I just needed to vent. No one else in my life has T1D or understands the mental and emotional tax it takes. So I came here to you lovely humans because I’ve been quietly seething for months 😂🫠.

1pqm4bb,Switching from type 2 to type 1 Lada,"So yesterday I received my lab results. 

I was diagnosed I had type 2 diabetes a couple years ago, and I was put on a couple different medications by my primary care one of them ended up hitting me into dka.

Now, my endocrinologist that I picked up while in the ICU from that thought I was type 1 because type 2 normally does not go dka. However the blood work came back with none of the autoimmune antibodies and my body was still producing insulin. At the time I was 32.


Fast forward a few years to present day and we are still battling overnight blood sugar spikes. PA of my endocrinologist order another round of lab just to take another one. The results came back again yesterday. My body is no longer producing its own insulin has not reading came back as less than 0.1. The antibodies that attack against the production were at over 100.

I have yet to hear from my immunologist as I get copies of the lab work as soon as they're available and he has not yet had a chance to review them. However, I am familiar enough I am looking at.

The good news is my blood sugar is mostly under control even now with an A1C of 6.7. I know this is going to have a few changes and at 34, I can't believe I'm going to admit this to a bunch of strangers on the internet, it's both reassuring and terrifying.

I say that as before I became a diabetic, 5 years ago, I was 360 lb. When I received my diabetic diagnosis, I'd already got myself down to 260 lb. And I still have people saying that my diabetes was because I was overweight. I'm currently down to 240 lb and I know now as of the realization this morning at the diabetes was not caused by my weight. However, switch from a type 2 to a type 1 is a lot of unknown, just as I was getting used to the idea of being type 2.

So, I'm hoping, I can get some insight on this and what I can expect in any change whatever finally been used to.

I struggled to make friends for a long time, and on top of that, whenever I met people and they eventually learned that I was diabetic, it of course brought a lot of unspoken judgement and assumptions that I couldn't do this or eat that. I felt like nobody understood what i was going through, apart from fellow diabetics. And I still do feel like that most of the time. But a few months ago, I made some new friends. They don't understand much about diabetes and T1D specifically, but they're not afraid to ask respectful questions and I'm glad to answer and share a bit of the life I'm living. And they often ask me how my blood sugar has been during the day, not in a judgmental way when they see me eating dessert, but in a curious way. They want to make sure I'm okay and they're genuinely curious about what my dead pancreas has been up to. 

So yeah, most people don't understand and the judgement and stigma that comes with it can be very frustrating sometimes. But if you're lukcy enough to meet people that want to understand and want what's best for you, it's not always bad. Hopefully everyone can find such people.

Acoustic alarms are life-saving, but they can also be incredibly annoying and stressful when they go off constantly. I wanted something more subtle. I love playing with light, so I built a prototype for an optical CGM indicator and want to share the results.

I call it BloodLight, because it sound cool.

**How it works:**

* We use CamApsFX, but as long as you get the readings into xDrip it works.
* I build a small App, the receives the readings from xDrip.
* In the app thresholds for low and high can be defined (image 2)
* Tech: I created a wearable using a BT LE enabled MCU with an RGB Led
* The app connects to the wearable and switches the light based on the defined thresholds (image 1)

I personally think (hope) that is help to remind of forgotten boli or can point to lows before any annoying alarm kicks of.   My hope is that this ""gentle"" visual reminder helps catch a forgotten bolus or a creeping low *before* the loud, annoying alarms start screaming.

1ppvn2a,Am I being dramatic?,"I work for a small company in Canada. My prescription and diabetic benefits are absurdly low. Last year, I asked my manager to try and look into increasing my benefits. The solution they came up with was a cost plus/HSA style account for me to use. The weird part is, though, is the claims for this HSA do not go through my insurance company portal - instead, I have to submit them directly to my manager who fills out a form and sends it to my insurance company for reimbursement. 

I, personally, feel like this is a violation of my privacy. Why should my manager see my prescription receipts? Why do I need to forward my Explanation of Benefit line items to my manager?

Is this something I should be speaking up on? I am very close to said manager, but still it's uncomfortable for me personally to know my manager knows my RX items, what drugs im taking, and what doctors I go to (all of this is on prescription receipts).",1766076528.0,4,5,diabetes_t1,diabetes

My 15 year old son (diagnosed at 4) has been neglecting his diabetes care.  Mom and I (divorced) are in disagreement about acceptable levels.   He regularly goes above 300 throughout the day and Mom thinks that it's just normal spikes from eating.  

I think most experts would say that a spike into the 200s is acceptable for a short period after eating but all the way into the 300s is excessive.  This is the level when the body shuts down and goes into ketoacidosis.  

She says it has to do with what he's eating because she allows him to eat large bowls of cinnamon toast crunch for breakfast (as an example).  I mentioned pre-bolusing, limiting quantity, drinking more water, choosing different foods with lower carb intake.

Can you share, if you have a teenager, how often you see your child going into the 300s?   As a parent who only see's him 1/2 time, what can I do to make sure this doesn't happen at moms house?  Would this be considered neglect?",1766073399.0,13,56,diabetes_t1,diabetes

1ppndkw,Switch from MDI to a Pump? (pump choice),"So apparently my only realistic options right now are the Medtronic 780G or the YpsoPump, and I’m really unsure what to do. Ideally, I’d go for the Tandem Mobi or t:slim X2 because I’m using the Dexcom G7 and really like that sensor, but tandem isnt available in my country.Unfortunately, the YpsoPump is currently only compatible with the Dexcom G6, and the form factor of the Medtronic 780G is a real downside for me.

Medtronic’s new Simplera sensor also only has a 7‑day wear time and needs about 2 hours warm‑up, which makes me hesitate. My current HbA1c is pretty bad, so I’m hoping a pump (ideally with a good AID algorithm) could help me get things under control. That’s why I’m wondering if the trade‑off with the 780G/Simplera might still be worth it, especially since I’ve heard good things about its algorithm for auto‑boluses and hypo protection.

I know YpsoPump is supposed to become compatible with the G7 in the future, but who knows when that will actually happen.

1ppkgrf,Type 1 diabetes at work – did I handle this situation correctly?,"I work in a group home for disabled Kinds/teen. I am trained in diabetes basics, but I am not a nurse or medical professional. My role is to calculate carbs (KE) and supervise, not to inject insulin myself. The teen injects herself.

Situation: In the morning, she ate breakfast: 52 g mixed rye bread = 4 KE, with butter. Her blood sugar before eating was 5.8 mmol/L, so perfectly in range. Because the value was good, I did NOT add any correction insulin – only calculated the meal bolus for the carbs.

She initially refused to inject the 4 KE insulin, saying her blood sugar was “good enough” and she would inject later at school. I did not feel comfortable sending her to school after eating carbs without insulin, so I told her she needed to inject the meal insulin now, as calculated, before going to school. She then injected the 4 KE herself.

Now I’m second-guessing myself because of the discussion and my own panic: Was I right to insist on the meal bolus after eating, even though her blood sugar was in range, and not allow her to delay insulin until school? Did I handle this correctly from a diabetes-management perspective?

I am thinking of having extra tests done but my endocrinologist would probably want me to start doing short term dosing but my initial thoughts are to keep it in range for most of the day when I haven’t freshly had a meal.

1ppgqyh,Trying to better understand short acting insulin,"TLDR- Short acting insulin is a new thing for us and the endocrinologist did a terrible job trying to explain why (beyond the fact that we need to have standard practices to actually understand how insulin/food is affecting him and therefore understand how to better manage things) it has to be given 15 minutes before a meal. Especially in cases where his BG is >300 but he is only grazing, or he thinks he is only having a snack but his appetite is more than expected. Like, we just can’t always predict what or when a meal is going to be, but when he’s consistently high like right now, we know he needs the insulin but don’t know how to best troubleshoot/tweak the highly specific instructions to make it work for our situation. 

Backstory- My BF (43) is the one with diabetes (I’m just the GF/part time caregiver); I believe it’s type 3c, even though it’s listed as type 2 in his chart. It was before I met him, so the details and timeline are a bit vague, but as far as I know he developed diabetes after some episodes of pancreatitis, metformin made him feel like death, and ultimately he skipped straight to needing insulin, ultimately landing on 30 units of long acting once a day. Until recently, he’d been stable-ish on that for the past 2.5 years. 

He’s always been a bit more loosey-goosey than I’d like in terms of glucose/insulin management, and while some of it is his personality/personal issues, some of it is because he’s medically complicated and he’s just trying to manage a lot, and his body is prone to doing weird stuff. 

Anyway, in October his A1C was 4.6, so they lowered his insulin to 28, and then unbeknownst to me he lowered it further to 24. Also when his CGM was due to come off, he didn’t put a new one on (his BMI is like 16, so he doesn’t have a lot of skin real estate to work with, and low platelets mean he bleeds a lot, so it’s been a whole thing). Fast forward to 12/2, and surprise surprise, his glucose was 698 when he happened to have some routine labs drawn. So, we go to the ER for IV insulin and fluid, and thankfully he wasn’t in DKA. 

For the past 2 weeks, we essentially just… managed it at home using the dexcom and Novolog pens we’d never opened from February (we’d planned to start using a sliding scale but then he was hospitalized for most of the next 2.5 months), giving him enough short acting to keep from having to go back to the ER (on top of the 30 units of long acting). Today we saw the endocrinologist and his A1C was 9.1… double what it was 2 months ago. 

So the new orders are 28 of long acting, plus 4 of short acting 15 minutes before meals. Our current issue is that because of his other medical stuff, we don’t have set meals, and sometimes he just grazes, but obviously if his BG is high, he needs the insulin, but she acted like giving it in any other circumstance than “15 minutes before an actual meal” was just a hard no.

Moving around felt terrible, I had to sit in fetal position to get my 30 minutes without throwing up. I kept throwing up until I was severely dehydrated and went to the er. The er made me wait a really long time and I kept throwing up.

My mom eventually freaked out and was yelling for help as I and she felt I was more and more likely to pass from the way this was going. The doctor was very mean to my mom, she was extremely rude and mad at her for speaking up for me. I’m certain she was punishing me for her outburst, I remember yelling out loud to the staff I could pass while waiting.

Eventually they put me on iv and I immediately my condition turned. No more throw ups, started slowly feeling a lot better. They didn’t take my blood, they made me drink a liquid and go into a machine. Then they sent me home and said I was good.

It was so long ago I won’t even be able to sue for negligence

All fingers point to a very slow onset of diabetes stemming from 10 years ago at least. A lot of malpractice and a tragic story of why I never broke any records

On a normal day I need 16-17 units of long acting insulin. However when I have 2+ days where I'm more sedentary, it's like my basal needs almost double.

My endo takes a more cautious approach to things, which I appreciate, but she is not very happy about me adjusting my basal rates much. She made it very clear that she did not want me to exceed 20 units of long acting a day.

Right now I have had 3 days off work and class and so I've been enjoying some much needed couch time. I'm at 20u long acting right now and I literally cannot get it to come down. My short acting is Afrezza and it works VERY fast typically to bring me down about 70 points for a 2u (I split the 4s into 2s) cartridge. On a normal day I may use a total of 4u of Afrezza. I'm currently at 10u since I woke up 5 hours ago and that line has not budged from 220. In fact it's gone up. The only thing I've eaten was about 10g carbs of chilli, which I've been eating as a regular meal for weeks now and it usually doesn't even budge my blood sugar more than 50 points because it's so protein heavy and proteins dont usually hit me very hard. My carb ratio is 1:20 so 10u is definitely not necessary for just the chilli. I'm not sick or anything, I'm just not walking multiple miles a day.

I'm not trying to scam my way into anything I don't deserve, I'm literally just trying to get access to a service I'm fully entitled to (the national parks pass is really lenient because they WANT people to self-report when they're more likely to have a medical crisis on their trails, so they can be prepared). By her metric, someone blind or missing a limb who's full self-sufficient and lives alone isn't disabled--disability only counts if you have a full-time human caretaker (not, say, a diabetic alert dog). I know ""is diabetes a disability"" is a controversial topic, but the ADA agrees with me here, and to have a doctor be so blatantly wrong about what a disability even *is* was really demoralizing. I ended up getting my paperwork (it just discloses my diagnosis without calling it a permanent disability, which sucks but is better than nothing), but it's total bullshit that a doctor's personal opinion can override ADA definitions like that.",1765996939.0,284,164,diabetes_t1,diabetes
1pp09qn,There is Hope,"I know we all need to vent over this wretched disease from time to time, but I thought I'd do something unusual and try to offer some encouragement.  I've been t1d since 1997, 28 years.  In my post-college years, I didn't have health insurance, and my A1c reflected that.  After getting married and having children, I found there was a whole new mental load that kept diabetes management more on the back burner than it should be.  Of course I wanted to be around for my kids, but at the time just taking care of their immediate needs had to take precedence.  For me, every endo visit was a hope that I'd maintain the status quo, because things sure weren't going to get better, until one of these visits I'd find out about some long term complication.  

  
Thanks to changing my endo to a supportive one who really worked with me, and using Tandem's most recently revised ControlIQ algorithm, three months ago I was able to achieve an A1c of 6.7%.  In 28 years I've never had an A1c lower than 7.4%, most of them it was 8%+.  At my appointment today, it was 6.4%.  All my other labs are showing improvement, kidney function, cholesterol, basically every metric.

  
I'm floored, and still feel on some level like I can't celebrate it because I'll somehow be punished by the universe for it.  There's no way lightning can strike in the same place again, that sort of thing.  But for those of us struggling, know that even though technology is improving slowly for us T1D's, it is making it more manageable, and making a difference.  ",1765987338.0,28,5,diabetes_t1,diabetes

i'll start off by saying that i know i did it to myself and i fucked up 😭  here is how it happened


I prebolused 120g of carbs for a pizza. I knew I was going to eat the entire thing in one sitting so no point in giving less. I also knew that If I prebolused my sugars would be fine after bc it was a supermarket pizza so i knew exactly how many units I have to give myself.

I prebolus, put it in the oven and wait. While the pizza was baking I gave my disabled grandma her dinner, some soup. She's eating, I'm waiting by the oven like a child by a christmas tree in the morning. Finally, the pizza is done baking, i put it on the counter. Then I hear my grandma calling me to her room. She spilled soup all over herself and the sheets, so instantly i forget about the pizza and go take care of her. I had to clean her up, then change her shirt, then change the sheets. It took a while, I was running upstairs downstairs to look for clean sheets in the house. After I sorted it out, I started to put clean sheets on the comforter. AND THAT IS WHEN THINGS WENT SOUTH. I was standing, then sitting on a chair trying to put the sheets on. My heart was beating so fast and I had literal black pixels in my vision. I had to put down the comforter, and I made my way to the kitchen. I thought I was having a heart attack or something 😭 then I saw the pizza on the counter and thought OH FUCK I PREBOLUSED 120G OF CARBS WHICH IS AROUND 21 UNITS WITH MY LEVELS BEING AT 80 WHEN I DID IT. I grabbed orange juice from the fridge (big bottle, no juice box) and started drinking it like a maniac. After that I sat down on the chair, still seeing black spots like pixels in my vision. I was extremely sweaty and shaking. Then I laid on the floor for a while. (I do not know how long but I was concious the entire time). I did have a glucagon on hand, so if I had to I would use it. When I finally felt better sugar-wise,i felt soooo bad. I had such a bad headache, and my sugars spiked to 300 from all the juice. I know i should have give myself insulin for it but I was too scared😭

After about **6 months since my son’s T1D diagnosis**, managed with **MDI + Libre**, he switched yesterday to a **Tandem t:slim with Dexcom G7**. For a short time both sensors were active, which made a direct comparison possible.

What really stands out is how **closely the curves align**.  
Peaks, drops, and timing look remarkably consistent between the two sensors.

The large spike visible in the graph happened shortly after starting the pump and was most likely due to the **first infusion set**, with the cannula probably not inserted correctly. After changing the set, glucose levels stabilized again and both sensors tracked the change in the same way.

This is obviously **just one real-world example**, not a statistical comparison, but it’s still impressive to see two different CGM technologies tracking each other so well.

The data is shown on two small DIY devices I built to visualize CGM history locally.

So also objectively, in just a year, a bad 3 day stint has my numbers better than they were on a 90 day average only a year ago today. The progress is actually great, and the fact I can only have this much detriment despite a decent amount of party/travel since my birthday is pretty cool to see. When im at home not and dialed with diet, sleep, exercise, and work, i can average a 105-125 with 85-93% tir, and everything kinda evens out to 126-129.

I just tried to add an event by holding the app on the home screen, and instead of taking me to the events section, it unpaired the sensor immediately. Luckily, I was at home and had the sensor number in the trash still, but if I was away from home, I'd be screwed because their app is broken.

While this one doesn't happen all the time, there is a 100% reproducibles list they know about from numerous reports but refuse to address (at least on Android):
* Fake volume overrides. The alert volume overrides straight up do not work and never have, it's false advertising. It will always use your phone's volume slider.
* Automatic spontaneous Do Not Disturb. This one is laughably dangerous considering the first point. Throughout the day, the g7 app will sometimes randomly set your phone to do not disturb. Considering the volume overrides are fake, this will not just silence your calls, but also your glucose alerts.
* Hidden auto-rotate override. It's not mentioned anywhere, but the app will ignore your settings to auto-rotate, which for the terribly built g7 app, means the app will freeze or go blank. Not what you want when treating a hypo.

I'm trying my hardest to be a good diabetic especially in this new year. 
My problem is, when my sugars go below 150, I feel like I'm having a low. Shaky, light headed, vision is weird, stomach pains.
It's like I don't feel normal when I should. Maybe I've been so used to the highs, that my body is reacting weird. 
It doesn't help that my libre sensors have been completely off and I've had to poke my fingers raw like I was just diagnosed.

1pnn67k,"Is it possible to properly manage diabetes for someone who doesn't, nor will ever, have a cgm or a pump?","Hi! As the title says, is this possible?

My endo, and partially my parents, have been constantly pressuring me into getting a pump or at least a cgm (mostly my endo, after which a fight with my parents ensues about why I don't want one).

The most common guilt-trip (if that's the right word here) is the basic ""you can't manage your diabetes properly without this, so if you don't get it you'll lose all your limbs and your eyesight and you will get organ failure and die"" and so on and so on...

The reason I don't want either is mostly related to my OCD. If there's one thing that will send me into a full blown panic attack, it's having something attached to me that I can't get off right then and right there whenever I wish.

For example: I was on a vacation and we had to wear this bracelet that was handed out by our agency. We got it put on when we were entering a beach, and I didn't think much about it then since it looked very easy to take off. I get back to the apartment and the chaos ensues when I go to shower and realize I cannot take it off easily. My brother texts our guide, asks if we can rip them off, and the guide says she doesn't recommend it because it's basically an entrance ticket to all of the beaches.
Great. Now I'm crying and hyperventilating and literally trying to rip this apparently indestructible bracelet. I decide to TRY to ignore it but it's absolutely impossible and I end up ripping it off (very violently, my arm hurt for days later) and I finally feel relief.

Mind you, this is something I had to have on for like a week?

So, long story short, this made me wonder even more about how I would feel about something like a cgm, not to mention a pump, with all the tubes and what not as well... And almost had a panic attack just thinking about it.

This was just a short example, but the fears and the symptoms are very real. I feel like it would mess with me mentally, BAD.

So, is it worth it to mess up my mental health in order to improve my physical one? Or can I manage this illness properly without sending myself to a psych ward...",1765843107.0,16,110,diabetes_t1,diabetes

1pnklg1,Medtronic Guardian 4 dying every 4 days consistently for months,"Hi there fellow T1s (20yrs for me in January). 
I’m not looking for advice on what to do as I know I will need to call Medtronic for replacement CGMs (guardian 4) but consistently since probably May 2025 my sensors have been going to “Sensor Updating…” then to “Change Sensor” on day 4 of the supposed seven day wear. 

I have been using a Medtronic pump for 19 years, and the guardians since their creation. I have also gotten a new transmitter in the middle of this fiasco but alas they still die in 4 days (I have had exactly 1 last all 7 since May)

I’m wondering if there is anyone else experiencing this long term issue as as I feel like calling Medtronic AGAIN to report the same issue when I have done everything to troubleshoot it will flag me as a problem patient. 

I insert in my right abdomen (which despite some folks reporting is ill-advised, is allowable and how I have been doing it for almost a decade). 

There is seemingly no logic to batch numbers, transmitter issues, etc to back up why this is happening to me. The only big change for me in this period has been about 16% weight loss due to a GLP-1. 

Is anyone else as frustrated as I am and dealing with this continued, illogic, 4-day sensor death across new batches, new transmitters and the like? I’m almost to the point that I want to get a class action together because this has ruined so many events and days for me when we should be able to expect the sensor to last the 7 days (which is always had until this spring)

He’s seriously considering going back to an insulin pump because he’s so tired of doing his injections, but he said that the microdoses of long term insulin that comes from the pump don’t work for him as well as the regime he does himself that consists of a combination of the long term and short term insulin does. He also is using the G7 Dexcom and that in and of itself gives him anxiety because (compared to the G6) it is much less accurate and people have died from the inconsistencies and accuracies in the readings.

1pmdzzi,Eating low carb vs dosing for carbs,My young adult daughter was recently diagnosed in the last few weeks and we are both trying to learn as much as we can.  She has seen her primary and had one visit with the endocrinologist.  She is on long acting and just started short acting insulin a few days ago.  She has always eaten healthy and exercises and understands the counting of carbs and eating more protein and veg and limiting sweets. But she is also young and has a sweet tooth.  So my general question is… does she have to avoid sweets or just dose for them appropriately?  If she wants to go out for icecream with friends does she just dose accordingly or try to find some zero sugar option if there is such a thing? Are eggnog and Christmas cookies a thing she needs to avoid forever now?  I guess this sounds slightly crazy but if I need to find recipes for sugar free eggnog and keto Christmas cookies for when she comes home for Christmas I’m gonna do that.

The local Tandem distributor is not allowing me to order even a few replacements until my clinic sends them a letter...and my last site is infected currently. 

I've prepared for this potential scenario by identifying a few online GP apps where I can pay privately for a same day prescription, and even know to identify pharmacies open on Sundays. I know how much glargine I need to take daily for long acting. 

However, I need to inject half-units of rapid acting. I know I'll need to pay out of pocket, but am curious: What is the likelihood I could get a prescription for the Novo Echo Plus and cartridge, or Humalog Junior Pen, and actually pick it up today?

1pm8l28,Nailed it! A success story about a bread bowl,"*There is a TLDC at the bottom if you don't want to read my wall of text below.*

Just had to share, as it's a lot more complicated than it initially sounds in the subject.

So, one top of diabetes I also have asthma (Yes, I'm already part of that Reddit group). I've been really struggling the past week with asthma and finally saw the doctor, who then put me on steroids to help me with it on a pretty strong dosage plan (I'm stuck taking it for 3 weeks!). Needless to say, I immediately adjusted my basal amount to compensate (I've done this several times before so know what I'm doing). 

First day is a bit rocky on sugar levels as my body adjusts and asks me what the heck I gave it. Next day (today) I'm feeling much better but still icky at first so I'm not really eating. I'm finally starting to get an appetite around 5pm when my family say they're going out with friends to eat and if I want them to bring anything back. Knowing where they're going I say yes, and check the menu for the restaurant. I immediately zero in on the onion soup...and then see it has the option of being in a bread bowl.

I know, I know. Bread is the bane of our existence, it's too much for one sitting, etc. But I'd been craving a bread bowl for months, and was just in the right frame of mind to say ""F it, I'm doing it!"" It's comfort food of the highest order now. My sugar has been stable for most of the day and I'm starving.

Two hours later, the food is given to me and I just stare for a minute. The bowl size-wise is about the length of a cell phone, they also included the top of the bowl, AND a small baguette on the side. Carb total came out to a little over 150. I took 50 units of Novolog and got to work. I ate all of it, and enjoyed every single bite.

 It's been a few hours since I ate all that, and just tested: 133 mg/dL. I admit I was a little worried once I had all that food in front of me, but by then I was already committed to going through with it. I'm so happy that it ended up alright.

**TLDC version:** Currently on a steroid due to asthma. Basal's adjusted, and 2nd day of meds am feeling like eating. Family goes out, eats, and returns with bread bowl and onion soup I asked for. Total carbs is over 150. 50 units insulin taken to cover. Few hours later I test and bl is 133.",1765698608.0,17,4,diabetes_t1,diabetes
1pm5wh0,Finally got a dexcom on!,"It’s been a rough year for me but the one silver lining is I finally got my dexcom g7 on, alone, consistently for about 4 months and going strong. 

I posted earlier this year saying I had never checked my bloodsugar since the age of 18. I had my first diabetic seizure at 25 in December, second in February 2025 at age 26, right before my previous post. Those two seizures were truly terrifying. I even had a third close call with my ex and I in my car while I was driving to get us breakfast in our small town. I was conscious, and sentient but not entirely in control. I was crust swerving and focusing as hard as I could to not crash and barely realized I was even low/driving poorly til my girlfriend at the time told me to pull over. Which I refused, we drove around our tiny town for maybe 15 minutes til she directed me home. Got juice and was ok. 

I really do want to be alive, and try to be a healthy person. But the girl who was in my car that day, and called 911 for both my seizures has left and I don’t blame her honestly, I was not at all healthy. 

I never really cared about my health or took it too serious as I was under the impression I’d be blind, dead, legless at best by 30. I simply wanted to enjoy the years I thought I had, wrather than adapting to a different life which we all have been forced into. I quit smoking after 12 years, and drinking after 6. Im 27 now and finally got a grip on my health. 

Idk why im writing this all I’ve never told anyone this, neither of my therapists, diabetic or regular have heard all of this in its entirety but I did take your advice. I started therapy and it helped me alot. My dad’s dead but I guess everything comes to an end. Thanks to all 5 of you who gave me advice, I almost killed myself that night and your words helped anchor me in reality and reassess my situation. 

Thanks. Hope someone else struggling out there can learn from my mistakes, I am happy and healthy now working hard to continue. I’m tired as I know many of us are, but we are strong. I wish you all the best of luck with your health 🤞 happy almost near year!

1pm51uq,A glimpse into my personal diabetes department,"Just sharing my personal diabetes department.  

Notes:

\- I have been doing this for \*years\*.  

\- The extra stash of supplies comes from restarting sensors and using my infusion sets for 4 days when they're working well. It adds up over the years. I order when I can, not when I'm running out. I want to have supplies on hand in case of who-knows-what emergency or job loss or supply chain disruption. Yes, I've been very glad I have an extra stash on hand when insurance one day decided out of nowhere and without warning that I needed to jump through an absurd number of hoops for an absurd length of time to get the privilege of using a CGM still.

\- Yes, I re-use my pump insulin cartridges -- two total uses per cartridge. This is the only thing that I don't order the maximum I can on -- or I'd have \*way\* too much in proportion to other supplies

\- Yes, I've kept my old insulin pumps and boxes for major stuff.  Nostalgia? My own personal museum?  I don't really know...

\- Yes, I've kept my old glucose testing supplies.  I have lots of finger-jabber testers. But I only have test strips for one kind these days.

\- I still have an old disetronic H-tron plus pump (my first pump) and a few medtronic pumps, and a few supplies for each. I'm now on t-slim x2.  I feel the t-slim is better in many ways but worse in others.  None are perfect.

\- Yes, that's a bbq sauce bottle -- I use it for a sharps container -- because that's what they request/require here.  Or I've used juice or ketchup containers.  It just has to be fairly sturdy plastic. ""The sauce is the boss"" --> ""The jab is the fab!"" 🤷‍♂️Gotta think of a better line...  
  
\- Yes, I also use insulin syringes.  I've been having problems with insulin leaking at the infusion set site, and all of the downstream problems from that.  So if I have the convenient choice, I often just do a shot.

\- Yes, I save my old insulin vials (not pictured).  I have no idea why.  I have a huge stash of them. If you have ideas on what to do with them (or can give me therapy to convince me that I'm never going to want to use them for some crafty project) let me know.

\- That one box of truesteel is leftover from my trial using it.  I know it has a following.  It didn't work for me.  It seemed like it was always getting infected.

I have been racing short course triathlon for 8 years, and am planning to sign up for my first ironman 70.3 race in 2026. (1.2 mi swim, 56 mi bike, 13 mi run).

  
I'm trying to figure out a strategy for viewing my blood sugars on the bike specifically. The swim is short enough I won't need to check, and on the run its easy to pull out my phone from a running vest.

I have a garmin bike computer that can show my dexcom G6 numbers, but its not super reliable, and the bluetooth connection fails often enough that I'd be nervous to rely only on it for the race.

I also learned how to extend the g6 sensor (soemthing I think they intentionally designed to be impossible on the g7). So, I have had no interest in moving to the g7. But recently I've noticing my g6s have been having A LOT of issues. It is consistently turning off randomly, reading 100+ away, and giving me false trends. At first I though it was just sensor malfunctions. I got replacements over and over and even wondered if it was the transmitter for a while, but dexcom denied that. Now, I am on my 6th sensor in a row where this problem is still happening and I am starting to wonder if it's manufactured to push users onto the g7. 

Dexcom just announced they are official shutting down manufacturing for g6 in July a few days ago, which i found a bit too coincidental. 

Unfortunately for dexcom, they just lost a customer because out of the g7 and the freestyle Libre 3 plus, the Libre was the farrr better option

1plr0br,My experience with Metformin,"34M, dx'd back in 2012.

I've been on an insulin pump since diagnosis, and still am. But a while back I started researching whether or not Metformin would have any benefit for a T1D, since it's a T2D drug (resources like PubMed, JAMA, Science, Nature, various university publications).  

Now, while Metformin cannot replace insulin for a T1D, it's possible to use as a sort of companion drug for the insulin. I read that Metformin has a lot of neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. Seems beneficial.

Well, I also read about how a T1D not only doesn't produce their own insulin, they also do not produce another hormone called amylin, which regulates hunger and satiety. Thinking back on it, I did have a lot of trouble with appetite regulation (always thinking about food, easily overate, etc.).

I asked my doctor if I could get a prescription, and to my surprise she said yes. She prescribed 500mg extended release, once a day after breakfast.

After being on it for a few weeks, I did notice some differences. Relevant: I'm 5'7"", 140lb, and a chronic long-distance runner.

Pre-Metformin, eating something carb-heavy would result in exaggerated blood sugar spikes, soaring into the 275 mg/dL range, and would remain high like that for several hours before slowly coming down. For example: one 8pc sushi roll would do this. And I would have to take 3-4 units of insulin to cover it.

Now, after one sushi roll, my blood sugar did peak at 200, but then started coming down steadily until I reached \~110. This was on 1.25 units of insulin.

I've also noticed better control with diet and eating. I work in an office and people are always bringing in treats. I used to be unable to resist. Not eating any would be white-knuckling it. 

Now, I almost don't notice them. Eating out of boredom hasn't been an issue. Now I tend to only eat if I'm actually hungry.

I've also lost about 5lb.

From a running perspective, my blood sugar wouldn't drop as rapidly as it did pre-Metformin.

In general, I'm finding my blood sugar is in range more often than before. I take less insulin than I did before. I feel more balanced with my eating habits. Honestly it's been a huge relief.

Now I get that Metformin isn't for everyone, that's between the patient and their doctor. But for me it's been greatly helpful. Metformin isn't essential for T1D, but honestly it seems to kind of act like a bridge for some other bodily dysfunction. 

I can't talk to the anti-inflammatory stuff anecdotally, but the science behind that looks promising. I'll assume that's working quietly in the background.

Also, it's super cheap.

Sorry for the long post, but wanted to share. This didn't solve all of my T1D problems, but it really helped reduce the severity of blood sugar spikes and appetite dysfunction. Small victories.

Any other T1Ds on Metformin? What's your experience with it been like?

My night time insulin used to be at 36 and now it's down to 25. I eat one meal a day during the week. I find it hard to eat while I work. Weekends I eat breakfast and snack. I can't get my blood sugar to stay in range. It's either going high or going low. I've been sick the past month. I had a stomach bug for 2 weeks. Then I came down with some gnarly sinus/respiratory infection of sorts. That's been going on for a week now. I will be high at night, give myself insulin to adjust, but it won't go down until early morning and then I'm hit with lows. 
I am terrified I am going blind. If that happens, I feel like I have to kill myself. I won't be able to live. I have no family. I have no friends. I rely on just myself. I wouldn't even be able to have eye surgery or procedures if I even can be helped. A year ago. My eyes were fine. But now, I don't think they are.

1plmk7a,I have given up on my dream of becoming an Air Force officer,"
First of all, I apologize if my English sounds awkward, as it is not my native language.
About two years ago, my closest friend and I shared the same dream of joining the Air Force, and we promised each other that we would become Air Force officers together.

After completing four years of study at a seminary, I was preparing for the military chaplain officer exam.
My friend joined the Air Force first and was waiting for me to follow.

However, a few months ago, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.
When I came to my senses, I was in the intensive care unit with five IV lines attached to my body.

I’ve come to accept reality now, but to be honest, I feel a bit depressed.
I couldn’t keep my promise to my friend, and she is continuing her Air Force life on her own.

I’m afraid of complications, and I worry about whether I’ll be able to live a long life.

Two months ago I started a regimen of low dose methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis. Nothing else really has changed in my life. In fact things have been good because the severe pain I was having is  greatly diminished (Yay!).

1pll6tj,Why I Use Daily Affirmations (with this shitty disease),"Living with Type I diabetes feels like walking a tightrope every single day — not just physically, but emotionally too.

Most days I manage the calculations, the planning, the restraint. But some days… it just hits me: the relentlessness of it all. The mental load. The frustration of having to think about every bite, every move, every hour. And when that frustration builds up, it doesn’t always come out gently.

Sometimes I swing hard in the other direction. I eat something I know will spike me — not out of ignorance, but out of rebellion. Out of sheer weariness. And afterward, I feel the blood sugar consequences and the shame, and I spiral.

I realized I needed something to anchor me in those moments — something that speaks to the why behind my care. Not rules. Not rigidity. Not shame. But something rooted in compassion and balance.

So for my own personal ""Independence Day""earlier this year I wrote this affirmation — not to be perfect, but to be present. Not to punish, but to nourish.

 Here's what I now say to myself:

My Affirmation
 ""I honor my body with compassion, not perfection.
  I am learning to choose what nourishes me — one choice, one moment at a time.""

Why I Chose These Words
Because perfection isn't sustainable. Compassion is.
Because this disease already asks so much of me — the least I can offer myself in return is grace.
Because every choice doesn’t have to be perfect to still be progress.
And because I deserve to feel empowered, not punished, in the way I take care of myself.

This helps me pause. To breathe before reacting. To remember: I’m not broken. I’m learning.

If this resonates with you, I hope you carry it with you too — and adapt it into words that feel true for your path.

1pkm62a,update?,"Hi, I went into the ER on Monday because my ketones were at 3–5, got admitted to the ICU and just left today.

In theory I’m fine, I have two concerns anyway:

1. The doctor told me I need to eat *way* much more carbs than my usual. I have struggled with ED since I can remember, and I was very excited to try a semi-keto diet (obviously not fully), so I need a minimum of 140 grams, so around 30–40 carbs per meal. I know that’s the normal, but living with an almond mom (btw, she fully supports me) it’s like I have a full pass for cheating.

The other thing that bothers me, and I’m really sorry if this is too long or doesn’t fit on the sub, but I’m kinda desperate and found amazing support here, is that I feel numb.

Thinking in the hospital, I realized that this started Friday, so that’s one of the causes I had a horrible party, which led me to a huge fight with my bf and best friend, which led to my bf thinking of leaving me, which led to me having the last drop, so I just cried litterally all day, and drank like 3 lt of water, stayed in bed and left the pump to the side.



I want to clear up: on Friday I started with the nausea, dehydration and horrible mood, i didnt ate nothing, and had a huge fight with my bf before the party, but thought it was just nerves or the dress fot the party being too tight. 



So now that y’all have kind of a background, i will explain myself.

I thought it would all be easier if I went into DKA and skipped some bad days. I know, that doesn’t make sense and sounds very stupid. When I realized “shit, I might not wake up” I panicked—it was like a wake-up call from God, so I finally told my mom my ketones were high.

Even though I know I’m very happy, and that thank God and my parents I’m alive, I can’t help but think that diabetes has taken basically all my conscious life, and if I could have, just for once, things easier, like handed right to me it would be fair. If things had gone worse, perhaps my bf or my best friend would realize that I have a side of the story, and that I was not a bitch like they said, but that I was trying to stay alive through the night.But at the same time, im just gratefull to not let it slide, but still i fill the numb, the idk.

1pkax4z,Is it normal to require different ratios + pre-bolus timings for different foods?,"I'm pretty new to T1, and I'm definitely still using training wheels when it comes to carb-counting and calculating doses.

When I was diagnosed, I was given a ratio of 1:8.5 and was told to bolus 10-15-mins prior to eating a meal. Since then, I've tried to adhere to that as closely as possible.

After ***a lot*** of experimenting, logging, and correcting hypos, I'm finding that ratios aren't necessarily 'one size fits all', and I need to adjust it along with my pre-bolus timing according to what I'm eating.

https://preview.redd.it/i75etr8ohn6g1.png?width=1714&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6dc2b14f79d07315c7c90308b12a0ebb5f7aaf6

For example: the meal in the picture above worked well with a ratio of \~1:12.5 taken immediately prior to eating, whereas I definitely need the full 1:8.5 and a 15-minute pre-bolus if I'm eating say - cereal with a cup of coffee first thing in the morning.

In other words: is it normal to vary your ratios and pre-bolus timings like this?

The pattern I seem to be honing in-on is that the glycemic index is correlated with the need to pre-bolus:

* Low - moderate G*lycemic Index -->* 0 -5 minute pre-bolus
* High G*lycemic Index -->* 15-minute pre-bolus.

While glycemic load correlates with how strong the ratio should be:

* Low - moderate *Glycemic Load* \--> 1:11.5 - 1:12.5
* High *Glycemic Load* \--> 1:8.5 - 1:10.5

Sometimes the doctors tell me to do things opposite to what another doctor said. I just want to be able to eat something without being stressed about it. No one in my life understands what I'm dealing with. Everyone keeps saying it's manageable. But it's not for me. I can't eat anything. I just want to give up on this whole stupid thing.

1pk0nna,Struggling with headaches since being diagnosed,"As the title says. I’m a newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic. I was diagnosed mid July in the UK. I was hoping you could help me out with some general questions as Iv found the best source of information is fellow type ones!

In general I’m coping well. Iv had good control from the beginning, most days I’m sitting around 90%, within my target. Exercise really helps. I find that exercise even 10-20 mins in the morning greatly reduces my spikes. I don’t however exercise on weekends and this greatly reduces my control jumping from 90% in range down to 70%. 

The problem I had early on was constant diabetic headaches. Felt like a tight band around my head especially in the temples. I was told after a couple months they would subside. They fortunately did. However I will get a really bad diabetic headache after waking up in the morning maybe once or twice a week. Iv noticed if I don’t exercise the likelihood of me getting a headache increases. I just don’t know what’s likely to be causing them. I would really appreciate anyone’s input please as I’m often off work with them. 

For more information. The day before I won’t suffer any crazy spikes. During the night I’m my glucose levels are stable and constant. I eat a snack before going to bed but don’t take insulin usually 10 carbs. I eat consistently the same thing through the week as Iv tried to get to the bottom of this. I haven’t seen a doctor as of yet and the nurses have been great in general but couldn’t help me with the headaches. I take my basal everyday around 5pm/17:00 with my dinner, usually 16-20 units depending on exercise.

1pjdsv2,How Much Should I Worry?,"TL;DR : Partner (F19) seems to struggle keeping track of blood sugar, want others' opinions on how involved I should be. Essential question at bottom  
  
I've been with my SO (F19) for about 5 months (Commutable long distance \~ 5 hours) and she got her type 1 diagnosis about 7 years ago. 

I'm honestly more curious about other people's experiences at this point, since I myself don't have any relatives with the condition. She's very open and comfortable about talking about it, but she has some avoidant tendencies that make it hard for her to consistently monitor her sugar. She has a Dexcom and a pump, and generally gets consistent updates (however, lately it's been neglecting to notify her or myself about low or high blood sugar episodes), but I've noticed she doesn't bolus before eating, and if she does it's usually with fairly arbitrary units (she usually always uses 45 carbs before meals). 

I'm a bit of a hyper-analyzer, so I don't want \*at all\* to impose my limited understanding on her management styles, and I don't want to be overbearing over her care plan. 

She has admitted a few times that she \*does\* want someone to be on top of her about it, though, so I try to remind her gently when I notice it being high or falling fast. But sometimes she stays above 300 for more than 3 hours, I'd say about 3 or so times per week on average this month but it really varies. She seems to have better weeks than others, but I don't really know if it's my place to bring it to her attention when it seems like it's been high for longer than usual. She's also complained about easy bruising on her feet, which made my heart sink.

According to her, her most recent endocrinologist appointment seemed to be really positive, so I'm hoping I'm overreacting. 

I really love her, and I don't want to overbear, I love health and pharmacology so this stuff is honestly really fascinating to me in a very non-judgmental way. But it's her life, and that adds a level of sober dread that makes me question whether being on her butt about it is worse than facing the health complications later. I would take care of her in a heartbeat, but I want her quality of life to be positive. So if I can contribute to her health in any way, it would be a blessing and honor.  

  
I didn't see many posts in this exact situation, because she's not borderline neglectful, but I do see (at least according to websites, which yes, I'm not proud of for being my only source other than her to learn about it) glucose patterns that aren't healthy. 

I think my biggest ""concerns"" for down the road is cardiovascular issues. It's a reality I'm completely willing to face, but I wanted to get an idea of your guys' experience. I want to be as sensitive to her needs as I can be, and we've had a couple conversations about it, but I wanted to get your guys' opinion of whether this sounds out of the norm for someone who has type 1. 

Anyway. Some people I've seen on these types of posts comment things like,  
""You said you don’t want to leave, but do you want to keep doing this for the next 10-20 years, depending how long his prognosis is?""  
Which is completely valid. And so far, the answer has been, ""yes, I would keep doing this for as long as it takes"". Which is why I want opinions on how I can approach this best. I don't want her to rely on me for her health needs, but I also don't want to not be a support if she needs it. 

Big question:

I wanted to raise awareness about a heartbreaking case in the UK. A 2-year-old girl named Lyla died this year from undiagnosed Type 1 diabetes after her symptoms were missed during a GP visit. She had classic signs — tiredness, thirst, lots of wet nappies, weight loss — but was diagnosed with something else and sent home.

Her dad, John, is now campaigning for Lyla’s Law, which aims to make simple blood or urine testing for Type 1 more routine for babies and young children who show the 4Ts (Toilet, Thirst, Tired, Thinner).

I know many people in this community have had experiences where their Type 1 was caught late, misdiagnosed, or nearly missed. I thought this might resonate, and maybe help raise a bit more awareness so other families don’t go through the same thing.

1pj8ue9,Tips for weightloss?,"Hi there. I'm just gonna cut straight to the chase. 

I finished college in June, and then I got a full-time job a few months later. Going from barely being able to afford food to being able to afford all the food I want has really had a toll on my weight. 

Long story short; I'm starting to have a Teletubby build. Just thick all over. It's draining my self esteem. I've gone from a size Medium to almost an XL. I can't look at my own body in the mirror, and I always try to hide my extra chin behind a scarf or a sweater. 

My boyfriend and I have been trying to eat healthy, I minimize my portions, even if I'm still hungry. We've added more vegetables to our food, we've minimized snacks to only being on saturdays. I work in a kindergarten, so I barely sit down during a workday anyways, and I lift a lot of toddlers. Sometimes I have to skip lunch and make do with a granola bar because of time limits. Nothing helps. I keep gaining weight.

Up until last year, before I got my insulin pump, I found it easy to lose weight because my blood sugar was high all the damn time. Now it's stable, and it's like my ass gets a little bigger if I have a glass of water. 

I'm born female, but legally I'm male (and I hope you will all respect this) and I'm hoping to resume hormones next year or 2027. This is an important detail, because my mom has the same issue. She almost exclusively eats vegetables, but she can't lose weight. And she's not even a diabetic. Ergo, I'm most likely experiencing a genetic issue. 

What the hell do I do, that won't affect my blood sugar? 

I really don't want to hit the gym, I'm away from home 50+ hours a week, and I don't wanna spend any more time away from home than that. I also need to get in touch with a physical therapist because my hypermobile joints are starting to cause me pain (most likely due to the excessive weight).
