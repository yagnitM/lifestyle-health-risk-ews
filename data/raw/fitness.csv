Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Let's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.

What's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Let's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

What's the point of having people guess your body fat?

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Let's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

What's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Let's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.

Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.

1hvvls5,Protein Science Updated: Why It’s Time to Move Beyond the “1.6-2.2g/kg” Rule,"#Link to article:  https://www.strongerbyscience.com/protein-science/

The latest article from Greg Nuckols explores the current protein recommendations and dissects the available data to suggest that a higher intake may be necessary to fully maximize muscle gains.  From the introductory paragraph:

>The recommendation that lifters should aim to consume “1.6-2.2g/kg” [0.73-1.0g/lb] of protein is almost universally taken to be an unquestionable truth. You probably don’t need to exceed 1.6g/kg in the first place, and if you do exceed 2.2g/kg, you’ll definitely just waste the extra protein you consume – it certainly won’t contribute to further muscle growth. However, a closer look at the meta-analysis that generated this recommendation suggests that we probably shouldn’t have been quite so confident that protein intakes within this range will maximize muscle growth. When you dive deep into the protein research, it looks like slightly higher intakes may be necessary to max out your gains.

This article is a deep and nerdy dive into the data, with calibrative cross references into even more data.  It concludes with practical takeaways, including advice on [how to scale the recommendation](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-18-at-11.53.16%E2%80%AFAM-2048x1300.png) by gender and body composition.",1736268134.0,1318,187,Fitness,fitness

1g54ik2,"2,000 Workouts Without a Rest Day","This is another update about training without rest days. I have surpassed 2,000 consecutive training days. Along the way I have grown bigger, stronger, and generally more fit. This is because training without rest days requires sustainability above all else. To accomplish that, my priorities as a lifter have shifted to consistency, patience, and effort. These are what I have previously referred to as “[the triumvirate of progress](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2022/).” Those three priorities govern sustainable progress, meaning gains.

**What this post is not…**

… me saying that rest days are wholly or even generally unwarranted.

… me saying that rest days are bad, suboptimal, unscientific, etc.

… me making a moral or ethical argument about rest days themselves.

… me trying to make you feel bad for taking rest days.  

**This post is…**

… an anecdote about training without rest days and how daily training has benefitted me.

**Stats**

Age: 38.7

Gender: Man(let)

Weight: 210

Height: LOL

Lifts: Squat [525](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0KGr8rAkAY/?img_index=1), Bench [340](https://www.instagram.com/p/CuSzsrhgtCx/), Dead [600](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4qKfzxAq9K/) (best ever was 635), Press [250](https://www.instagram.com/p/Czw7oYDAwKT/?img_index=2).

Natty Status: I was on TRT nearly a decade ago. Tried it for a year. Didn’t benefit from it like I thought I would based on what I was told at the time. Nothing during this period. I have not and do not claim to be a “lifetime natural.”

**Why I decided to start training daily (and heaps of other detailed information)**

That and more can be read in my previous posts:

[Five Years Without a Rest Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1bob6rg/five_years_without_a_rest_day/)

[The Tom Platz Experience: Pain, pleasure, and high rep squats](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1953k9l/the_tom_platz_experience_pain_pleasure_and_high/)

[Four Years Without a Rest Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/12lgk9f/four_years_without_a_rest_day/)

[No Rest Days](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/yaw8qa/no_rest_days/)

[1,000 Workouts Without a Rest Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/sb7tbh/1000_workouts_without_a_rest_day/)

**Training without rest days has benefited me because:**

**-** By prioritizing sustainability over all else, I make better training decisions. This results in fewer injuries and minor setbacks, meaning more gains with less risk.

**-** [Lifting is something I enjoy, so I do it often and feel better because of it.](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2023/04/physicality-creativity-and-consciousness.html)

**-** Frequency is a significant factor in making progress, whether that is gaining size or strength. I am now bigger than I’ve ever been and stronger in nearly every lift.

**-** My general fitness has improved due to the increased training frequency allowing for more training diversity. Meaning more opportunities to include conditioning workouts whereas previously nearly all my workouts were strength oriented because “I didn’t have time to do conditioning” consistently (an excuse).

You might benefit similarly if you decide to train without rest days. You might not. All I can say definitively is that I am happy with my results and because training is itself a luxury and a pleasurable experience, I will continue to do it daily.

Counterintuitively, busier people seem to do better with daily training. This is because a three-, four-, or five-day training week (as is typical) packs in exercises and a progression that can take an hour or more to complete. Busy people often do not have that kind of time. I have found that my busy clients can manage 30 to 45 minutes consistently and sometimes even less than that. So, to accomplish their goals they have started training daily, with each workout being shorter, biasing the program towards consistency, which ushers results when coupled with patience, effort, and of course sensible exercise selection, volume, and intensity progression.

While most of my training has been based on my [General Gainz training framework](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/), there are occasions when my progress is not derived from General Gainz, or even my own [original training structure](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-gzcl-method-simplified_13.html) (modeled after a pyramid). These resources will provide to you a reasonable structure with which you can build your own training programs. Even brief ones, so that you can also begin training daily (if it is right for you; some may have contraindications).

There are two things that have recently benefitted my training. The first was when I ran a program called Maelstrom which resulted in a lifetime personal record [600-pound beltless deadlift](https://youtu.be/q0_bACQ8MvI?si=YjLVb1mWvqcaiBps). Here is [a review another user wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1cy1oq2/upcoming_program_review_gzcl_maelstrom_for/) of their experience running that program. This was a very unusual approach to training the deadlift because it is high frequency, high volume, and low intensity.

The second occasion was when I had only a brief period to get a training session in. This happens somewhat regularly now because I own my own business. To train effectively in a short period of time I would do workouts that I began to call Monotony. These helped me maintain the daily training streak because even if I had only 15 minutes in my schedule, I could still hammer a lift and benefit from the workout. Perhaps you would likewise benefit.

You can read [Maelstrom & Monotony](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2024/10/2000-days-maelstrom-monotony.html) and watch me perform those workouts on my blog and Instagram. On my blog you will have access to an updated program compendium, so that way you can perhaps run one of my old programs like GZCLP, Jacked & Tan 2.0, or try drowning in deadlifts by running Maelstrom.

1ejwyxa,42 Male Cancer Survivor 8 Months Progress ,"Start: 190lbs 8 Months: 154lbs

Around 3 Years ago in the summer of 21 I was diagnosed with stage 4b rectal cancer. I was 39.

Underwent 2 years of treatment which included radiation, chemo and 4 Surgeries. I had my 4th and hopefully final surgery in Sep of 23, I am currently in remission.

I used to workout in my 20's but lost track of my fitness and allowed myself to reach 36 waist size.

  
**Progress Pics:**

I don't know why i took this pic but this is me post covid, i probably weighed like 220+ at this stage

[https://imgur.com/a/ronPlvk](https://imgur.com/a/ronPlvk)

This is me in Feb of 24 - [https://imgur.com/a/u9b3FA1](https://imgur.com/a/u9b3FA1)

This Pic is from July 6th - [https://imgur.com/a/eK61dsX](https://imgur.com/a/eK61dsX)

I just wanted to help my body heal and repair the damage from the 2 years of treatment and made a commitment to myself to try and do some workout and hopefully make it a habit.

**Diet:**

**Dec - Feb:** The most important change was my diet, I was asked by my surgeon to start taking a high protein and as low carbs as you can diet to try and combat some post radiation issues in my GI tract.

I did intermittent fasting for 16 hours from 7pm - 11am

First Meal - Chicken/Fish , Sauté vegetables(more colors the better), 1 Bowl Fruit

Second Meal - Greek Yogurt With Handful of Almonds, 2 Ripe Banana's

Third Meal - Grilled Chicken/Baked Salmon, 2 Slice Sourdough Bread



**Feb - Current** : I stopped doing intermittent fasting and added a whey isolate protein shake. I target to eat my third meal before 7:30 pm each night

Right After Workout - Whey Isolate Protein Shake, Overnight Soaked Almonds

First Meal - 2 Whole Boiled Eggs, 2 Whole Boiled Egg white only, Greek Yogurt/Cottage Cheese

Second Meal - Chicken/Fish , Sauté vegetables(more colors the better), 1 Bowl Fruit

Around 3-4pm - Whey Isolate Protein Shake

Third Meal - Grilled Chicken/Baked Salmon, half cup or full cup of wild/brown rice.

**Exercise Routine:** 

I started with r/bodyweightfitness  minimal routine and a self made warmup routine in the third week of Dec 23. Following was the routine

Warm-up

All of these were done for 30sec - 1 min

Seiza

Deep Squat And Hold

Bear Walk

Crab

Horse Stance

Dead Hang

Minimal Routine

I did this like a circuit on an average i did 4 per day

Push Up

Squat(bodyweight)

Low Row(Two Bedsheets in a door)

Plank

Jumping jacks

I did this routine with a goal to be able to do 10 push ups 20 squats 10 low row 1 minute plank 35 jumping jacks.

Around Feb of 24 I started noticing some changes in day to day energy levels and it just felt good and my post radiation issues were also easing down.

I was not able to go to gym yet since i was still dealing with a lot of post treatment issues and i wanted to be able to challenge myself without needing to buy weights as I live in an appt.

Did some research and bought a cheap squat rack from amazon and a pair of gymnastics rings, parallettes, a set of resistance bands. The squat rack was for hanging the rings and getting a bar to do pull ups.

I went with a modified version of the beginner routine from r/bodyweightfitness wiki the warmup routine remained the same except i removed the dead hang.

All Pairs in Supersets with a 90 sec rest in the pair and 60 sec rest for the core superset pairs.

3 sets - rep number changed throughout, the below numbers are what i am doing currently

Pull Up - 5

Squats(Bands) - 10



Ring Dips - 8

Ring Hamstring curls - 15



Ring Inverted Rows - 8

Decline Push Up(parallettes) - 10



Core Superset

Hanging Knee Raises - 10

Palof Press - 10 each side

Superman - 10



I now have access to a gym and was wondering what would be a good program to start my goal is to build strength and get down to 14-18 % body fat range.

I was looking at the 5/3/1 for beginner and liked this following routine

Day 1:

– Superset Bench with: DB Row, Planks

– Superset Squat with: DB OHP, BW Bulgarian Split Squat

Day 2:

– Supserset OHP with: DB Curls, Paloff Press with Band

– Superset DL with: Pushups, DB Lunges

Day 3:

– Superset Squat with: DB Rows, DB Swings

– Superset Bench with: DB Lateral Raises, Leg Raises (on bench)

a set of  main lift, a set of both accessories, then rest 90s.

I plan to swim for 30 mins on rest days

Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Let's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.). This isn't a thread to announce what you find attractive in a mate. Please use the report function for any comments that are out of line.

Day 1: 3 sets of max reps

I was wondering if for day 3 for the ladders, it would be better for me to do chin ups rather than pull ups, since I would be hitting the muscles from a different angle or something like that? Or should I just stick with pull ups for the program, and do the ladders normally. I dont have rings so it would just be on a normal bar.

1qagk80,Anyone else feel kinda lost with calisthenics sometimes?,"  
Not sure if it’s just me but I’ve been doing calisthenics on and off and I keep running into the same issues.  
I like bodyweight training but honestly I’m often scared I’m doing stuff with bad form and messing up my shoulders or elbows. Sometimes I stop mid workout like “is this even safe or am I just grinding my joints lol”.

Another thing is I never really know what I should focus on.  
Should I try to build muscle? or work on skills? or just get stronger first? feels like doing everything at once = doing nothing.

Progress is another weird one. At some point reps just go up and then stop, plateau hits and I start questioning if this is even working compared to gym training. Weight changes don’t help either, gaining weight hurts pull ups, losing weight feels like I’m not building anything.

I guess my biggest issue is lack of clarity. No clear direction, no confidence that I’m doing the “right thing”, so motivation drops even if I actually like calisthenics.

1qacbbv,Question for adults early in calisthenics,"I’m interested in hearing from adults who are early in calisthenics, especially those working toward their first pull-up, handstand, or similar foundational skills.

If that describes you, what has been the hardest part about staying consistent with your training week after week? For example: motivation, lack of structure, time constraints, recovery, uncertainty about progress, boredom, or something else entirely.

I’ve noticed that many people know \*what\* to train but struggle with long-term consistency rather than individual workouts. I’m currently exploring whether a “Duolingo-style” approach to calisthenics skills (short daily sessions, very small progressions, streaks, and low mental friction) would actually help beginners stay engaged over time.

I’m not asking for program advice, just trying to understand what the main sticking points are for people in this stage.

1qa9jj9,Maintenance goals,"I’ve been doing a workout at the gym of barbell back squats , flat bench press, and chin ups along with lat raises up until this point. 

Recently with college coming up and the fact I won’t be playing sports. I don’t have the time or really the motivation to go to the gym so I plan to just do a fast hassle free home workout. The goal is to do 100 pushups, 200 body weight squats with a calf raise. And use a pull up bar to do around 50 chin ups. Two maybe three times a week. In the meantime I’ll just take them all to failure or do sets since the squats are the only thing I see myself completing to my set rep range. Once that gets too easy I may incorporate a weight vest.

My question is does my new workout still likely maintain at-least relatively to my old workout in targeted muscles. And the bigger question is does it create any major muscle imbalances I need to worry about as I spend a lot of time at my desk studying or drawing. And I’d like for my posture to be strong.

After some research  and revisions this is the workout plan I am likely going to do please give me your thoughts.

Pushups, and bodyweight squats,half or more of the reps will utilize calf raises, and chin ups, on Sunday and Friday. Wednesday pullups, and single leg glute bridges. 25-50 reps is the goal for Wednesday’s workout to mitigate muscle imbalances for shoulders and hamstring.",1768162021.0,1,2,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1qa08x3,How to train grip strength and tendons,"I trained on and off for a couple of years. For the past few months, I’ve been trying to make it a habit, with my main goal right now being to improve my pull-ups (current max is around 3×4–5). I never really managed to make progress, so I decided to focus only on inverted rows over the winter and return to pull-ups once the weather allows me to train at the outdoor gym again (no option for a door frame pull-up bar).

My back and biceps have definitely gotten stronger. The problem now is that it feels like my tendons give out much sooner than my muscles. For example, yesterday I did 4×10 push-ups and inverted rows and stopped as soon as I started feeling my forearms. Today I don’t have any muscle soreness, but I have a strange sensation that goes from my elbows all the way into my fingers, which I assume is tendon-related.

How do I strengthen my tendons and grip strength?  
Should I just do fewer reps and let them catch up over time?  
Would some kind of grip training tool help?

1q9uu26,How to adjust RR to include HSPU training?,"Hi, I've been doing RR for a few weeks now and yesterday I read all the Q&As about RR. I noticed that I've been doing the breaks wrong. I always did the exercises in a row without a break, then took a break and did the exercises again as a double exercise, etc.

Secondly, although I am new to calisthenics, I am relatively fit, so I have always expanded the RR for myself to include pike push-ups and frog stands (I want to learn HSPU as my first skill and I miss specific exercises for this in the RR). Then there's skin the cat, toes to bar, and cossack squats. For push exercises, I have also extended it to pseudo planche push-ups and diamond push-ups/archer push-ups.

Since I probably had tendinosis in my left elbow, I finish with wrist curls, wrist extensions, dead hangs/German hangs. I also end the workout with 5-10 minutes of stretching (because I'm incredibly inflexible).

The pain from the tendinosis was gone during my last workout, so I can now do pull-ups and rows.

A workout takes about 1.5-2.5 hours. Between days, I do skill training with a focus on handstands and L-sits plus mobility. Sometimes I also do leg training, as it's a bit lacking in my plan.

My actual question is: Do the experts here completely advise against expanding the RR? And if so, when should I specifically train for HSPU strength, for example? Skill Day is not supposed to include this.",1768122611.0,2,3,bodyweightfitness,fitness

For reference: I am 5’4 F, 220 lbs, and have had fibromyalgia and general chronic pain for most of my life (it actually came before the weight gain, and honestly contributed to it). 

Right now I am doing 10-25 minute workouts every day, usually doing one session at early noon and two sessions throughout the night before bed. These are primarily arm and core focused, with every exercise involving 10 lbs dumbbells. I’m currently focusing on getting stronger and gaining muscle in the arms (that I of course eventually want to be visible). Should I stick to spaced out sessions or get everything over with in one go? And how many rest days should i realistically take to get the best results? Currently I’ve been working out every day, or every two days whenever I’m hurting too bad. I don’t hurt from working out but that could also be because my body is more accustomed to low level pain.

1q9dmpg,Discussion: Training Full V-Sit On Rings,"Hello friends, has anyone here ever achieved a full 90-degree (legs fully vertical) V-sit with RTO? This is a skill I'm really interested in achieving, and is rarer a goal than the standard set of levers/handstands/planches I see here.

I am curious to discuss/ask about this topic since there is so little resources online for this move. L-sit on rings is easy enough to find discussions and advice on, and there was a lot of old discussion regarding the manna being impossible on rings due to having to push the rings backwards to perform the move. There doesn't seem to be much for the V-sit specifically on rings, however.

  
Every time I search for the V-sit (specifically on rings) online, I get one of the following results:

1. Discussions about the floor/rings L-sit

2. Discussions on the manna

3. V-sit on the floor

4. A ""V-sit"" done sitting on the ground sort of like a weird yoga move or something

5. Some weird or completely unrelated shit lol

  
The gymnastics code of points references a V-sit on the rings specifically with legs vertical, so the move definitely exists and is intended to be done somewhere, but it seems to be such a rare move to find any pictures of.

I can do a rings V-sit with good form (RTO locked out, straight legs) at about 30-45 degrees, as well as get up to \~120 degrees on the floor, but I find on the RTO version I tend to just push the rings backwards and subsequently eat shit. I think with sufficient strength I can avoid this, but at what point does it become basically impossible like the rings manna? The balance on the V-sit sort of requires I push the rings backwards a bit. 

This skill seems to be less commonly trained and less desired, but I think it's an amazingly technical and fun display of strength. There's an excellent manna guide someone made years back which sort of covers a floor V-sit, but unfortunately does not cover any aspect of the rings V-sit.

Anyone with any thoughts on this training? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I want to motivate myself to do more leg training, because without a gym and equipment, everything I've done so far has involved exercises

that were very uncomfortable or difficult to perform—one-legged squats, for example! Now I've incorporated leg extension exercises

with weight cuffs, but these only go up to 5 kilograms and unfortunately only 2 fit per leg due to their bulky size!

Adding a weight vest doesn't work because unfortunately it can't be secured to the leg and naturally falls off!

I have now ordered a 30-kilogram vest to make the squats even more intense, but when I think of the people at the gym

who are already using 20 kilograms with the bar alone and then add weight plates on top, 30 kilograms for the legs seems a bit

ridiculously low to me.

I need an exercise that covers the entire quadriceps and buttocks, but increases the intensity on its own,

yet is not so uncomfortable or difficult to perform. I was thinking of eccentric step downs, but I'm still

not sure if they really cover all the muscles. Do you have any ideas about which exercises would be perfect for covering the entire quadriceps and buttocks

in one exercise, and where the intensity should be the most difficult part and not the execution?

I'm not planning on using my weight vest for pullups or dips. I'm doing OAC progressions and I'd rather progress to various ring dips like Bulgarian or RTO dips instead if adding lots of weight.

1q8flas,Want to mix weight lifting and calisthenics,"So, I have been going to the gym for a little while now, and I want to try mixing my weight training with some calisthenics so I can build up my bodyweight strength. Also, because I can do calisthenics almost everywhere, if I travel I don’t have to skip a single day of training — which is something I usually do now when I travel.

I don’t have much experience with bodyweight training, honestly. I know about push-ups and some other things I’ve seen on social media, but when I think about it, I’ve only really done push-ups, sit-ups, and squats. I’ve never really done any proper bodyweight training.

I would appreciate any advice on how I can split this into my week. For example, could I do PPL (weights) + PPL (bodyweight), or PPL (weights) + UL (bodyweight)? I don’t have a lot of knowledge, so any advice would honestly help.

  
And well when I get strong enough I could mix weight with bodyweight like weighted dips and pull ups I have seen people do that in the gym sometimes.

Just for some info: I’m 188 cm (6'2"") and around 110 kg (242 lbs).

1q8eabz,Breathing during pullups,"I am a beginner to fitness, currently i can do 3-4 good pullups in a row. I was wondering if my breathing technique is right or not? I usually take a breathe in at the bottom in desdhang, and i feel my core engage, then i pull to the top and while lowering down i exhale, and so on.
Usually for push excercises I tend to do the opposite, i exhale when pushing the weight and inhale and brace on the way down. And sometimes for heavy stuff i just hold my breathe for the entire rep. 
I would appreciate some insight into this, and in general amy corrections i should make to my  breathing method. Thank you",1767979221.0,14,10,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1q8bu3f,"Years of plateau/slow progress, where is the bottleneck?","Been training calisthenics since 2020 but for the past couple of years or so, my progress has been very limited. I weigh 58kg at 166cm, and have been at this weight pretty much for the past 4 years. I feel that it may be caloric and protein intake limiting me, but I’m also trying to find out if my training routine has been good enough to actually stimulate growth. 

I’ve been following PPL, and my workouts usually look like this:


Push:

Ring dips - 3 sets (my max is 15, then the following sets usually go down in reps)

 Pike pushups with feet elevated - 3 sets

Decline ring pushups - 3 sets 

Body weight tricep extensions - 3 sets


Pull:

Pull ups - 3 sets (my max is 15 and has been for a very long time, however i have started doing them weighted recently)

Inverted rows - 3 sets

Ring face pulls - 3 sets

Ring curls - 3 sets


Legs:

3 sets of pistol squats or bulgarian split squats 
3 sets of RDL 



With my training, i used to leave the first and second sets with like 1 or 2 reps away from failure and only went to failure on the 3rd set, but for the past few months  i’ve been training every set hard to failure to see if my training intensity was the issue. There still hasn’t been significant progress after making this change. 

In terms of progressive overload, I would do this by just adding reps overtime, but this has been nearly impossible to do consistently for the past few years of training. With pull ups for example, one week i could be doing 13-15 rep sets easily, a few weeks later i’d be down to 10-12 despite maximum effort and it would fluctuate a lot. 


Based on all this, what are the limiting factors preventing my progress in strength and physique? Answers are much appreciated

1q8adqs,"RR 1-year progress post (24M, 5'11, 137 to 160 lbs) + affect on mental health","Hi all,

I'll try my best to keep things short and sweet. I'm a 24 year old guy (180cm/5'11), and last year I took up the recommended routine and I stuck with it for a whole year. [(Before & After Pics)](https://ibb.co/album/GWnGp8)

Some background, as a teenager I was on the chubbier side, leading to a long battle with eating disorders and body dysmorphia that led to hospitalization at 15. I lost a lot of weight and kept it off, but I didn't have a lot of muscle. Around 16/17, I went to the gym for over a year but saw minimal progress since I wasn't really eating much. From ages 21-23 I didn't really do any form of exercise besides figure skating, and I was very unhappy with the way I looked. The thought of going to the gym scared me a lot (and it still does), so I looked into at-home methods and came across this subreddit and the RR.

When I first started the RR, I was very weak; I could barely do 5 push-ups (with horrible form), and I could only muster one measly pull-up, but I stuck with it and quickly saw progress. For the first six months or so, I worked out 3x a week, and since then I reduced the frequency to working out every 3 days instead since I was starting to lose motivation. Alongside this, I began eating a lot more (especially protein). I don't really track calories or my weight due to fear of falling back into bad habits/EDs, so I only really track my protein roughly and weigh myself every now and then when I come across a scale at a friends house or at the doctors office.

For these reasons, take these measurements with a grain of salt, but I went from 61-63kg in January 2025 to now weighing 72-73kg, a change of about \~10kg. I've become a lot stronger than I was before, but I've also gained a bit of fat. I now do most of my exercises weighted (pull-ups, chin-ups, push-ups, dips, etc...). For lower body I do pistol squats and b-stance RDLs. Lower body isn't really a priority for me since my legs are naturally thicker than my torso and I still figure skate quite often which gets them working a decent amount.

My body has definitely changed, my clothes fit different, people notice and point it out, and putting the pictures side by side, the fact that there is a difference is quite clear. However, I have found my body dysmorphia and self-consciousness has only gotten worse. I look in the mirror and am disappointed by myself and my progress, and comparing myself to the people I see on social media only digs the hole deeper. I find myself criticizing my 'genetics', and sometimes wonder if I shouldn't have even started working out since there is no point and I will never look good. I'm extremely self-conscious about my chest since I have a muscle deformity on my left pec, so I will never have those aesthetic pecs I always see online, and I hate my love handles and the way my body stores fat in my lower-back.

That probably got a bit too dark very suddenly, but I'm sure a lot of people can relate to these feelings. I truly thought that if I started working out and my body changed I would stop feeling this way about my body, but I haven't, even though I have objectively changed my body for the 'better'. This has led me to conclude that I will never be satisfied and I will endlessly chase an unattainable ideal if I keep thinking this way. I've struggled with self-compassion my whole life, and I think it is pivotal that I try to be kinder to myself. As long as my body is healthy and mobile, I am so grateful. The reason I write this is I know how harsh some spaces can be in terms of body-image, and if any young people read this I really hope you can try to decenter your looks or your body from your worth as a person. Life is so unpredictable, and unfortunately it can end abruptly any second. Please try not to obsess over counting calories or weight-watching, just focus on being healthy and strong, and always be kind and gentle to yourself.

I feel like that was a whole lot of nothing, so my apologies. Anyway, yes the routine works if you lock in. I do feel like I've started to plateau a bit but I'm going to have a look at my current exercises and try to revamp it a bit, and this year I want to focus on mobility as well.

If you have any questions please let me know.

1q895ai,Proper Dip Technique,"Hello!
I (F, 31) am about 120 days into my calisthenics journey and I am starting to see improvement in my dips, but I'm concerned that my form is not correct. I want to make sure that I'm maintaining a proper forearm alignment before lessening the band assistance in order to lock in the technique as well as to prevent injury. I can't seem to find a consensus on forearm alignment. I've read that they need to stay vertical regardless of targeting chest versus triceps, but in some videos where people are targeting their triceps more forearms ultimately recline because of the more upright posture. I know with a vertical forearm because the elbow is stacked over the wrist you have a stronger line of pushing which makes the movement more efficient/effective. I have good shoulder extension range of motion but I find that when I try to keep my forearms vertical AND maintain an upright chest (while keeping my scapulae in the proper position, of course), this requires my body to be really forward (relative to my hand placement). I found that if I flex my trunk forward while maintaining a hollow body this allows my forearms to remain vertical and I have a really strong push. However, my goals are triceps strengthening more than chest strengthening.

Can I please have clarification on proper dip technique / alignment?

I’ve been training for about 4-5 years (mostly at home with limited equipment), but recently I’ve cleared up my schedule and joined a gym (past 4 months) to take things seriously.I used to perform the recommended routine as well but it was not super compatible with my gym now as it is crowded sometimes.

**The Problem:** Since joining the gym and increasing my volume, I’ve seen decent hypertrophy (muscle mass growth), but my **relative strength is actually decreasing.** \* **Pull-ups:** Used to do 15 clean reps; now struggling with 12.

* **Weighted Pull-ups:** 8 reps w/ 10kg, 1RM is 25kg.
* **Wall-Assisted HSPU:** Used to do 7 clean reps; now struggling with 4.

**Current Routine:**

* **Frequency:** 6 days a week (1 rest day).
* **Split:** Each muscle group 2x per week.
* **Mix:** Combining gym machines/weights with bodyweight movements.
* **Diet:** Very clean, plenty of fruit, no alcohol/smoking.

**My Goals:** I prefer calisthenics over machines and want to master specific skills:

1. **Muscle-ups** (I feel completely stuck here).
2. **Front Lever** variations.
3. **Archer Pull-ups & Pistol Squats.**
4. **Transferable Strength:** I want this to carry over to rock climbing and boxing.

1. **Regression:** Why am I losing rep strength while gaining mass? Am I overtraining with a 6-day split?
2. **The ""Stuck"" Feeling:** I have the base strength (weighted pull-ups), but I can't bridge the gap to the muscle-up or front lever.

1q6tzem,** Weighted Ring Pushups vs. Weighted Parallette Pushups for Hypertrophy? (Feet Elevated),"Hey everyone,

I’m looking to maximize chest hypertrophy and I’m torn between two variations for my main horizontal push. In both scenarios, I’m using a weight plates and my feet are elevated to the same height as my hands to keep the body horizontal.

**Option A: Weighted Ring Pushups**

* **Pros:** The instability forces more stabilizer recruitment and allows for horizontal adduction (squeezing the hands together) at the top.
* **Cons:** Harder to balance as the weight gets significantly heavy.

**Option B: Weighted Parallette Pushups**

* **Pros:** Much more stable, which usually allows for higher mechanical tension and heavier loading. Deep range of motion.
* **Cons:** Fixed position, so no converging movement at the top.

For pure muscle growth, which one do you think is superior? Does the instability of the rings provide a better stimulus, or is the stability of the parallettes better for pushing more weight and reaching failure safely?

No matter how much I progressed, starting in a dead hang, there was no difference between me and someone who just got their first pull / chin up.

I do one arm dead hangs, but with a pronated grip, so I got good at that. I can hang comfortably without spinning, and I could probably start adding weight in my free hand. One arm hangs with a supinated grip, I spin without any control over it.

1q6a5df,Best Weight (GYM) Training Exercises to Support Calisthenics Skills (Beginner Question),"Hello everyone,
I’m completely new to this subreddit, so apologies in advance if this question has already been answered somewhere in a post, wiki, or FAQ. I tried searching, but couldn’t find a clear, consolidated answer — so I decided to ask directly.

I’m primarily focused on calisthenics skills (muscle-ups, planche, front/back lever, handstand push-ups, etc.), but I also have access to a GYM with barbells, dumbbells, and machines.

My main question is:
Which weight-training exercises best complement calisthenics and help improve strength, control, and skill progression?

More specifically:
Which barbell, dumbbell, or machine exercises carry over best to calisthenics skills?

Are there weightlifting movements that are especially useful for pulling strength, pushing strength, core, and shoulder stability?

How much weight training is “too much” if the main goal is calisthenics performance?

I’m not looking to replace calisthenics with weights — only to use weights intelligently as assistance to get better results in bodyweight skills. 

Thanks in advance to everyone who takes the time to answer. Any advice, experience, or links to good resources are highly appreciated!",1767775040.0,2,9,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1q627on,Want an athletic body,"




Hey everyone,

Right now I’m training sprinting alongside mostly bodyweight strength work, and I’m trying to be intentional about where I’m going long-term. My goal is very clear: I want a lean, stripped, athletic body, high explosiveness and speed, strong relative to bodyweight, and joints that can handle sprinting year-round (knees, ankles, hamstrings). Not bodybuilding, not powerlifting. I want strength that actually transfers to movement.

What I’m doing right now:
I currently sprint multiple days per week (acceleration, max velocity, and tempo/speed endurance), with occasional meets or hard sessions on weekends. Strength-wise it’s mostly bodyweight: push-ups, dips, pike push-ups, pull-ups, chin-ups, rows, split squats, assisted pistols, step-downs, calf raises, tibialis raises, and core work like planks, hollow holds, and hanging leg raises. I also do daily ankle work, basic mobility for hips and hamstrings, and light shoulder health work. This works, but I feel like I’m leaving explosiveness on the table and I want more structured progression, especially for tendons and joint stiffness.

Where I want to take it:
I’m transitioning toward a mostly bodyweight-based sprint support program built around mass-specific force, isometrics, slow eccentrics, and contrast training for explosiveness. The idea is simple: get stronger per kg of bodyweight, build tendon resilience, and improve sprint carryover without chasing max loads. Sprinting stays the priority, strength supports it.

Planned weekly structure:
Monday: speed/blocks (track)
Tuesday: upper push + shoulder resilience
Wednesday: tempo or speed endurance (track)
Thursday: posterior chain + knee/ankle MSF (key day)
Friday: tibialis + isometric core
Saturday: meet or hard sprint session
Sunday: upper pull + MSF holds or full rest

What the strength work emphasizes:
Lower body work is sprint-first: slow eccentric hamstring work with isometric holds, single-leg strength (split squats, pistols, RDLs), Spanish squats, step-downs, knee isometrics, heavy calf and Achilles isometrics, and balance/ankle stiffness work. Upper body stays athletic, not bodybuilding: pike push-ups, dips, explosive push-ups, pull-ups with eccentrics and isometric holds, scapular control, shoulder stability, and core stiffness for sprint posture (hollow holds, L-sits, Copenhagen planks). Explosive work is kept low-rep and high intent using contrast methods like isometric holds followed by jumps, bounds, pogos, and broad jumps.

Daily mobility stays short and focused: quick ankle/hip activation before track, loaded calf, hip flexor, and hamstring stretching after, plus optional foot and ankle work before bed.

End goal:
A sprinter/gymnast-type physique. Lean, visibly athletic, high power output relative to bodyweight, and durable enough to train speed consistently. Move like an athlete, look like one, and stay healthy.

I’d really appreciate feedback on whether this weekly structure makes sense alongside sprinting, if the volume looks reasonable long-term, and whether you see any recovery or overuse red flags. I’m open to simplifying things as long as explosiveness and transfer are preserved.

Thanks in advance.",1767750641.0,2,9,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1q61q84,Standing Ab-wheel roll out perfecting,"Ive been trying standing ab wheel roll-outs for a while now . Casually been at it for a couple of years.

I started with a couple of hundred situps a few days a week, then doing 100 ab wheels from kneeling position (no break), then doing that with 10kg back pack (minimal break), then standing into a wall from a meter away working to full flat out, then doing it on incline with heavy brick to stop the wheel. Finally when i started doing it freely I noticed my lower back caves in when on the last section of laying out.

Problem is I can't stop my lower back caving in when i get to the final bit before puling back. It doesn't cause any more pain aching than usual strenuous exercise but need to know what i can do to perfect it. Has any one had any luck using a band hanging from above and around the waist or is that just applying a band aid to a deeper'/ better problem to fix?, maybe a weightlifting belt. 

Would post vid or image but not getting the option to do so. I have been doing them on the driveway on an incline and it doesn't feel like its any better.

1q5yuz0,"Pelican Curls - No tension in biceps, no DOMS the next day","Virtually everyone who has done pelican curls on rings, even just eccentrics as a beginner progression, mention that they feel intense tension on the biceps in the extended position and experience brutal DOMS in the days afterwards. T-Rex arms and all. It makes perfect sense why that would be the case. 

However, when I'm performing pelican eccentrics I simply do not feel the level of tension that I believe I should be, nor do I experience notable DOMS the next day. I do feel some tension in the biceps during the movement, and a very slight barely perceptible level of DOMS. 

It's definitely not because I'm strong enough to handle it. It has to be because there's something wrong with my execution, but I genuinely can't tell what it is. I do full 8 second eccentrics, head straight, keep my core/glutes engaged, straight back, chest forward, shoulders depressed, maintain supinated grip without rotating the rings out of my palms at the bottom, etc. 

I wonder if it is due to limited anterior shoulder extension mobility, and the tightness from the pecs/shoulders during the eccentric causes tension to dump from the biceps into those muscles.

I am still working on early assisted German hang progressions. Anterior delt / chest mobility is probably my weakest mobility area. 

Has anyone else had a similar issue as what I described? Was it also due to the mobility issues I theorized might be the problem? Do you need to have a comfortable full German hang before even starting pelican curl progressions?? ",1767742213.0,4,3,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1q5lhs5,"""Coregasm"" problem during some exercises","Hi everyone, long time lurker here, I hope this is the correct sub for this post. I've been training bodyweight/calisthenics on and off in the last years, but recently I've been trying to get back into it a bit more seriously, especially as complementary training for another related sport.

I need/want to train my core for a variety of movements/exercises/skills, BUT I have a big problem with it. Some core exercises (mostly compression abs/legs static holds, L-sit and variations seems to be the worst for me) inevitably give me a ""strange"" feeling after a set amount of time that prompts me to stop even though I feel I still have some ""energy"" left. I've tried to push through the feeling (while alone and at home) and yeah, that happened, it was weird.

I've tried to research about it a bit in the past, but haven't found much, especially from other men (seems a bit more common in women? or maybe it's just something men wouldn't openly talk about?) and I definitely haven't found a ""solution"" for it, mostly banter lol. That's why in the past I simply began avoiding those exercises.

Has anyone here ever experienced something similar? Does it get better (less frequent) with training? Or am I better off trying to avoid those exercises when possible? It would be a shame, because I would really like to train/achieve some related skills (and I definitely wouldn't want something like THAT to happen in public.)

1q5e6mv,Should I split or stay with RR?,"Hi,

I used to do a lot of bouldering and endurance sports. Then I tore my upper biceps tendon and had children, so I didn't do much sport for about 6-7 years. Now the children are old enough, and I have joined a gym and exercise 5-6 times a week very early in the morning (around 4-5 a.m.) before work for about 1.5 hours.

Since I want to get functionally fit, I found the RR here and am currently doing it. At the same time, my first goal is to learn how to do a HSPU (I've never been able to do a handstand). My overall goals are to master alle the calisthenics skills in a few years and to be holistically fit. This includes, above all, flexibility and mobility. Ideally, I would therefore like to incorporate daily stretching/yoga/mobility into my routine.

I pay close attention to performing all exercises slowly and in a controlled manner. Unfortunately, I can only perform many of the exercises to a limited extent because I don't have the necessary equipment (for example, there is no machine for Nordic curls, and using a bicep bar takes too much time). I want to buy rings and parallettes now.

I still have a lot of strength left after most exercises, and I notice that I lack technique and flexibility in particular. That's why I still do additional exercises to exhaust myself. For example, front and back lever training, Cossack squats, archer push-ups, etc.

I've therefore modified the RR slightly for myself and always exceed 1.5 hours per workout. That's why I'm considering splitting it up.



Now to the actual question:

Does it make sense to do a split at my current level of progress? For example, upper/lower body split or a push/pull/leg split? Or am I asking too much and only hurting myself?



My progress in the RR is currently as follows:



3x5-8 pull-up progression --> 3x5 skin the cat (due to current elbow problems, probably tendinosis, I paused with pull-ups)

3x5-8 squat progression (3x10 Bulgarian split squats with 14 kg per arm)



3x5-8 dip progression (3x 10 dips with 30 kg additional weight)

3x5-8 hinge progression (3 x 12 RDL with 40 kg)



3x5-8 Row Progression (due to tendinosis, I am currently doing pike push-ups and frog stands): 3x 6 Elevated Pike Push Ups + 3 x 30-45s Frogstand



3x5-8 Push-up progression (3x 10 Pseudo Planche Push-Ups)



Core Triplet

3x8-12 Anti-Extension progression (3x12 Tucked Hanging Leg Raises)

3x8-12 Anti-Rotation progression (3x 12 Banded Pallof Press on cable machine with 20kg)

3x8-12 Extension progression (3x 8 Reverse Hyperextension)

1q4f9m8,Best full body workout machine for home to complement bodyweight training?,"been doing bodyweight workouts pretty consistently for a while now and really enjoy it. pushups, rows, squats, core stuff, all good. the issue is i work full time and some days i just don’t have the mental energy to piece together a full session, especially when i want something more full body and a bit smoother on recovery days.

i’m not trying to replace bodyweight training or turn my place into a gym. i’m more looking for the best full body workout machine for home that pairs well with bodyweight work. something that lets me hit multiple muscle groups, control intensity, and stay consistent when motivation is lower.

space is limited, noise matters a bit, and i’m not interested in gimmicky machines that promise everything and deliver nothing. i’ve read the FAQ and searched around, but most discussions focus on pure bodyweight or full gym setups, not really the in between.

a few things i’m curious about:

what machines actually complement bodyweight training instead of overlapping it?

does having adjustable resistance make a real difference for progression?

are there compact options that still feel worthwhile long term?

anything you bought that genuinely helped consistency instead of collecting dust?

not looking for medical advice or shortcuts, just trying to be realistic about time and energy while still training smart. would love to hear what’s worked for others who mainly train bodyweight but added one solid piece of equipment at home. thanks.",1767597809.0,39,38,bodyweightfitness,fitness

M-W-F, each day do one Push, one Pull, and one Leg exercise, 3/4 sets each to near failure, introducing progressions as I get stronger. 

So it looks like this on Monday, Wednesday and Friday:

Push up progression, 3/4 sets to near failure.

Pull-up progression (will start with using the gymnastics ring horizontal row regression)

Squats or lunges progression 3/4 sets to failure.

8kg gained across these pictures in slightly under a year. Looks like I completely just gained fat?

I'm training with the recommended routine. During this year obviously I've added mass, add weight to my lifts (+8kg in bw on pull ups, then +5kg in weight etc. This is similar across all movements, dips, rows etc). So I have successfully gotten stronger.

What I don't get is im doing exactly what I did initially to gain those first 7kgs, but it seems like I've hit a brick wall where gaining lean mass past this point doesn't line up with something like 0.5kg a month. Which doesn't seem to make much sense as I am still relatively ""underweight"" and ""under muscled"" for my height (186cm, 72 prior to bulk, 80kg at end).

My issue really is that I would like to be a jack of all trades and am wondering if there is a way to make it work. I want to be stronger (especially relative to bodyweight strength), but not just for the sake of moving more 'additional weight' but more so to be able to easily manipulate my body in space. I also want much more resilient tendons and joints because the weakness I feel is not only muscular but also structural and I've been really injury prone. 2 skills I'd really be able to achieve as a starting point are muscle ups (rings/straight bar/with technique/ but also slow ones using raw strength) and the free standing handstand (ultimately free standing handstand pushups). I also wish to have stronger and more capable legs for the purposes of sports (they feel like a limiting factor whenever I try to participate in any sport). 

I know this is kind of all over the place, but I really dont know how to approach my training for these goals.

I'm a software engineer, who works 9-6, spends 1.5 hours in traffic and loves his wife so can't sacrifice my time with her. Yet, calisthenics is my passion, so I work a 3 day split, where I spend a solid 1.5 hours on my workouts. Any more than this and I can't commit to it.

- Pec minor tear (Healed)
- Golfer's elbow (Healed and actively working on it for the long run)
- Knee problems due to a bad squat (Currently going through rehab)

Day 1 - Pull
- Adv Tuck Front Lever Holds: 4x20-25s
- Weighted Pullups (5kg): 4 x 4-6
- Tuck Front Lever Rows: 3 x 6-8
- Chest to Bar Pullups: 3 x 4-6

Day 2 - Push
- Tuck Planche Holds: 4 x 15-20s
- Planche Leans: 3 x 20-30s
- Ring Dips: 4 x 5-8
- Pike Pushups: 3 x 8-10

Day 3 - Ring Muscle Up
- False Grip Australian Pullups: 4 x 8-10
- Band-Assisted High Pullups: 4 x 3-5
- Feet-assisted MU transitions: 3 x 4-6
- Ring dips: 3 x 5-8

Any advice? Will this help me grow more strength if I do it about 3-4 times a week? Anything else I should add? 
Also I'm about to move to college so keep that in mind. And my posture is wack so I still out my stomach and dont use my glutes/core to have proper posture. I need that fixed ",1767413592.0,2,11,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1q2k65l,How to split up my training?,"Hey guys,

I just started again getting into training.

Because I have heaps of time I would like to go to the gym as often as possible for the next 3 months.

I started with fullbody workout but would like to split it up now.

But I am not sure how.



**About me:**

m/31

1,73m

69 kg

I just can guess bodyfat but I’d say \~15%



Went to the gym 10 years ago.

Know the basics about training and food.



Work as an Arborist and got some serious backpain through work Few months ago.

Made a CT, visit Doctors, Physio, Osteo.. etc.

Nobody knows what it is, just everyone says —> build up muscles.

I actually have good muscles except of my abs, they’re super weak.

So first I did those boring grandpa exercises.

Finally my back is in better condition to do a bit more advanced exercises.



Cause I need to do exercises anyways and I got heaps of time I decided to go into full body training.



**My goals:**



1. Fixing my backproblems (focus on core training)
2. Getting myself strong for work in 3 months
3. Getting into calisthenics (focus on exercises which will help for handstand etc., and don’t need a lot of equipment)
4. Getting ripped (changed my diet less sugar, more protein) don’t care too much about that point



My workout the last two weeks:

**Outdoor:**

Running (4-6km) 1-2 times a week/ hiking once a week

**Gym:**

Because I didn’t want to get injured I had lots of reps and low weight.

So slowly I am using more weight and having less reps.



Warmup. 15min



**Core: (10-20 reps) 1h**

Dead bug 2kg in hands

Side blank 1min\*3

Bird dog 2kg in hands

Reverse plank 30s\*3

Hollow rock 30s\*3

Hyperextension

Side bend 20kg



**Rest of body: (6-15 reps) 1,5h**

Pull up (assisted) -10kg

Dumbbell bench press 16kg

Incline dumbbell bench press 16kg

Arnold press 12kg

Bizepscurl 12kg

T bar row 20kg

L sit (a few seconds haha)

Shoulder shrug 16kg



As I said I could do a bit more weight, but I want to increase it slowly.



I want to add:



* Leg training
* One arm dumbbell row
* Spent less time with core training



At home doing a bit of Yoga and stretching.

Practice Handstand on the wall just for the balance.



**My Questions:**



1. How do I split that up in Push and Pull training?
2. What should I add?
3. How can I do my core training more effective?

I'm trying to start doing some calisthenics in my room.

The problem is with pull up. I have seen that are critical, but i cannot use one on my door or on the walls. I was thinking in getting some dip bars as they are affordable and can be stored in my room. I already have seen folding pull up stations, but they are quite expensive without knowing if a will keep with calisthenics(Yeah i know it sounds like an excuse, but i prefer to be honest). In addition i think rings can´t be an option to as the same as the pull up bar, in the case of the door, and i think i don't have any other place with a can use them. Should be something with own standing.

Would be the dip bars a good option? Is there any alternative or recommendations?

1q2hpuf,Cannot keep my core braced for RDL's no matter how light the weight.,"I've done a variety of routines for several years now, but I always hit a very low plateau with leg/back work because I have an exceptionally weak core/groin. Any time I push past a certain point, I feel the beginning of groin strain. I'm working on some PT movements and lower intensity core moves to hopefully reduce this issue but it's been a real damper on my strength and skill progress. 

I'm currently doing a variation of the Recommended Routine and have managed to improve my bracing for squats by reducing weight, though I feel like I'm still too relaxed at the bottom. 

With RDL's though, I cannot seem to stay braced throughout the movement no matter how low I go. I'm not sure if it's because my hamstrings are too tight but I can't focus on engaging my hamstrings and bracing my core at the same time during the movement. 

Has anyone else struggled with this? Should I just stop doing RDL's and do some hamstring isolation work until my core is stronger? ",1767405547.0,1,10,bodyweightfitness,fitness

I am a beginner, I am trying to learn how to train properly at home and I have been training with the RR routine for months and I am very happy with it.

Unfortunately, however, I have never been able to train with dips and would like to start doing so to improve my upper body strength.

I would mainly use it for dips but also for horizontal row progressions, which I currently do awkwardly with a table.

**My only doubts are about what features are best for a dips station: how high should it be (I am 180 cm tall)? Is it better for the parallel bars to have separate bases or to be connected to each other for greater stability?

1q1fs4b,Wanting some Advice,"I have been thinking a lot about why my weight loss has been so up and down for me over the years. Every time I start trying to lose weight things actually go fine for a while. I keep track of what I eat I eat food I get more exercise and the scale usually shows that I am losing weight. The problem with my weight loss always seems to happen a weeks after I start. I miss a couple of workouts I eat food that's not good for me, for a few days I do not sleep well and I have to deal with normal everyday things. My weight loss is what I am really struggling with. When things do not go as planned I tell myself that the whole week is a failure. I do this of just making some changes and moving forward. This mindset makes me want to give up on the week. The week is what I label as a failure and that is when I start to feel like I should just give up on the week.

When I look back the plan itself was always okay. My problem was how I reacted when things did not go perfectly. If I had a week I would get really upset.

1q1a740,Progressed quite a bit on push ups,"Hello stranger. 24 M here. Six months ago i started doing regular push ups and my progress has been visible both in terms of ability and visual shape of my chest and front delts. My chest looks more solid and the upper pecs are slightly more perky. My delts have a bit more of a tweaking sort of shapeliness. My triceps also are slightly more dense and solid. I couldn't even do 10 push ups when i started and now i can do 38 in a row. I have a naturally bulky and thick physique. People have described me as looking strong and solid. I have an industrial body. I did one of those body composition tests and i had 44 kg of skeletal-muscular mass and 15 kg of visceral fat which scored me in the high percentiles for body density. So, i'm naturally pretty dense like a horse. My goal is not a six pack since i naturally carry a lot of fat in that region. I tend to do better with a program that emphasizes time under tension. I no longer do straight push ups because it's more volume than necessary. I do them in phases. 3 seconds down, 2 seconds up, and a 5 second squeeze at the top. I'd like to achieve a more expanded physique and tighten up my midsection a lot more. I'd also really like to build my shoulders since those are my most aesthetic physical traits. Any advice?

I have watched his ""My Foolproof Calisthenics Template[](https://www.youtube.com/@Kboges)"" video, but I find it seriously lacking in instruction. 

  
So far I have gathered

1. 1 push, 1 pull, 1 leg exercise. 

2. Set a number of reps for the day for each exercise.

3. Gradually increase the number of reps over time



I am very confused on   
1. How many sets do I perform the reps in???

2. Do I rest between sets??? How long????

3. Do I complete all reps/sets for one exercise before moving to the next, or is it a circuit?

4. What is a ""hard"" set? He mentioned it his ""day 1"" video but he never defines anything. 

5. What exactly are all the push/pull/leg exercises you could do?

6. Do I do this daily? I thought it was 6x per week but in his Day 1 video he says he started at 3 times per week?

  
I'll be honest, I'm surprised these basics aren't all just laid out in a small document. Seems like the entire point of his program is simplicity. Makes me think I'm just not looking in the right place. Is there a program I just need to buy or something to get these simple answers?

1q0idmb,Am I doing too much volume?,"I apologize in advance for any grammar mistakes — English is not my native language.
I’m starting to incorporate more bodyweight movements into my gym routine. My main goals are hypertrophy and general strength. My staple exercises are dips and pull-ups (wide, neutral, underhand, and overhand grips).
A few weeks ago, I did 5 supersets of chest dips with overhand-grip pull-ups and 5 supersets of triceps dips with neutral-grip pull-ups, for two sessions in a row (with 7 days between sessions). I felt sore for a few days afterward, but I didn’t experience any pain or joint discomfort.
On the other days of the week, I continued my usual upper and lower body workouts and felt fine. My training is mostly based on basic compound movements: barbell squats, RDLs, leg press, cable rows, barbell rows, preacher curls, skullcrushers, overhead press, and lateral raises. I didn’t notice any drop in performance after adding the dips and pull-ups.
My question is: am I doing too much bodyweight volume if I perform these calisthenics supersets once per week?
My main goal is hypertrophy, but I also really want to improve at dips and pull-ups — being able to do higher reps and eventually add weight.
Am I increasing my risk of injury by adding these supersets while keeping my usual weight-room workouts?",1767201876.0,4,2,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1q07jt3,"Some questions regarding Activating the transverse abdominis or deep core muscles in calisthenics, maybe overanalysing, but, need answers","To activate the transverse abdominis muscle we are generally instructed to pull the belly button towards our spine. 

My doubts arised from a jacked guy doing pushups which would be considered super shitty according to this subs standard. But the guy can do front lever, planche holds, etc: https://youtu.be/mZRbKITrWFA?si=OzVDeQDCp3ZkEmFI. 

But, I see no intentional core bracing or anything in his pushups. Is it because he takes care of his core musculature through other targetted movements?



**Doubt 1:** 

I think activating the TVA can be achieved regardless of spine position. The spine position matters when the internal and external obliques are activated. Then we typically call it a brace with neutral spine. To pull into posterior pelvic tilt or hollow body position we also need to contract the rectus abdominis. Am I right with this concept, or wrong?

I have personally tried pushups without actively doing any core engagement. My spine remains neutral and stable. But my core muscles are still lacking and I believe that they are the weakest point in my entire anterior chain. But, when actively contracting TVA, breathing becomes tough, but, the next day I feel much more stable overall throughout the body.

Will actively engaging TVA or infact doing the entire brace action give me faster core progress using pushups? Otherwise I would have to do separate core focused workouts to build up my weak core?

  
**Doubt 2:**

Is my above doubt entirely because the pushup level I am at currently, is not suitable for my core strength? And once my core catches up, my belly button to spine cue will become automatic without thinking about it at all? Just like a natural thing when I go to the pushup position on the floor? Is that why I don't see any advanced calisthenics practitioners actively talking about it in the videos?

**Doubt 3:**

In pullups I do arched back pullups. I feel them more in my back. I don't think about any core engagement cues for that, at all. Am I okay doing it like that?

  
It may be all over analysis. But I really want to know if I am feeling the way I am feeling because my core is weak and if it all becomes automatic when it becomes strong? Like I don't worry about my pecs not getting engaged or falling off my ribs even though I didn't feel them initially during pushups. Should I worry about the lack of core engagement feeling during pushups? Or should I actively engage my core unless it becomes natural and automatics in my pushups?

1q025oc,Long time weight lifter looking to transition to pure calisthenics for 2026 - seeking help.,"Hello everyone,

I recently turned 36 and have been lifting weights since I was 16. Like many, I started out as a dumb teenager doing bench and curls, then eventually moved into more serious training with proper dieting, squats, deadlifts, and structured programming.

Over the past \~10 years, I’ve really dialed in barbell training, mainly focusing on the powerlifts with some assistance work. Along the way, I’ve always been drawn to the simplicity and athletic feel of *street lifting* and weighted pull-ups/dips. I’ve managed to work up to a clean +100 lb pull-up for a single.

That said, small nagging injuries are starting to creep in. At this point in life, being able to play with my kid, feel good day-to-day, and stay injury-free matters more than chasing numbers. Loading 400 lbs on your back after a long workday and then spending two hours with a three-year-old really tests focus and recovery.

**The good news:**  
I have access to plenty of equipment at home:

* Power rack with pull-up bar
* Dip station
* GHD
* Rings
* Climbing rope
* Bands
* Echo bike
* Barbells and dumbbells

**The challenge:**  
I’ve mastered barbell programming, but I’m far less confident when it comes to bodyweight and calisthenics-style training:

* How should sets and reps be structured?
* When and how should I add load?
* How do I progress skills over time?
* How should I organize a week? (I’ve always thrived on 3× full-body training.)

**Stats / lifestyle:**

* 36 years old
* 6’0”, 220 lb, \~14% BF
* No macro or calorie tracking anymore
* Mostly meat, veggies, fruit
* 2–4 L water/day
* 6–8 hours sleep
* Lifetime natural (no PEDs)

**Current benchmarks / goals:**

* Pull-ups: 11× bodyweight
* Dips: 14× bodyweight (still rebuilding after a shoulder injury)
* Dead hang: 1:30 PR
* Handstand: cannot perform yet
* GHR: 10× bodyweight

I’d like to improve these lifts/skills while staying healthy and enjoying training again.

What I’m struggling with conceptually is this:  
In powerlifting, progress is simple—add squat + bench + deadlift and you get a number. With bodyweight training, I’m unsure what the equivalent “main lifts” are and what I should be tracking and progressing over time.

I genuinely enjoy movements like reverse hypers, back extensions, banded handcuffs, ring work, jumping lunges, and general athletic-style training. It feels like I’m falling in love with the gym again after barbell lifting started to feel more like work than play.

**My question:**  
What does this community consider the “main lifts” or key progress markers in bodyweight / street lifting training, and how would you structure progression for someone with a long strength background but aging joints?

1pza9yz,I split my work out throughout the day. Is this wrong?,"I read that the most important thing is the number of sets per week and taking those sets to near failure. I do a modified RR three days a week.

Short days are only pull ups, push ups, squats, and ab wheel.

Longer days are push ups and dips, pull ups and inverted rows, squats, and ab wheel.

I know I need a hinge to really complete things (alongside some more core), but that deficiency aside, I’m wondering if I’m hurting my progress by spreading out the sets throughout the day. I’ll do push ups and maybe squats around lunch, take a long break, do some pull ups later, take another long break, etc. By the time I end the day, I get all the exercises done that I want to, but I never feel like I “did it” because it’s not … like, it doesn’t feel like a workout session? It just feels like scattered movements.

To be specific, I’m doing 2 sets close to failure for each exercise. The 2 sets are semi-close to each other in time, but the other exercises are often far apart. But all on the same day.

I split it up like this because I think of it as “getting exercises done in advance,” which makes the “real” exercise time not as daunting. I already did some early, you know?

1pyotvz,Would a no-drill pull-up & dip setup make sense for small apartments?,"I live in a small apartment and prefer working out at home, but space is a constant limitation. Drilling into walls isn’t an option for me, and with the limited floor space I have, a full pull-up stand or power tower just doesn’t make sense either.

I’ve been trying to find a practical way to do pull-ups, dips, and basic bodyweight exercises at home without permanently modifying the apartment or sacrificing a lot of space. Most solutions I’ve seen either require drilling, are bulky, or take too long to set up and break down, which makes them unrealistic for everyday use.

An ideal solution would be a compact pull-up & dip setup that:

\- doesn’t require drilling into walls or ceilings

\- is easy and quick to assemble

\- can be moved around or stored away when not in use

I’m curious if others here are in a similar situation. Have you found a solution that actually works in a small apartment, or is there a product you’ve used that you’d recommend? I’m not looking for the cheapest option, but something reasonably priced that’s still solid and stable enough for regular use.

1pyihst,Is Yellowdude|Gravgear Youtube channel AI?,"So there's this sorta gimmicky channel on youtube that makes calisthenics content. He calls himself yellowdude. He uses an animated yellow character thats in a very chiseled shape and has only eyes. This is likely to let everyone feel included.

His sub count is at 1.3 mil i beleive, which is very big and seems to upload consistently once a week. Hes been joined since 2020 and has sold books about calisthenics. People received them just okay and most claimed they'd be a great option for beginners. Hes recently done a sort of business collaboration with gravgear. I beleive they sell books if im not mistaken and as well as some gear like weighted vest and paralettes. From what it seems to me, theyre a bit overpriced even when adjusting for being american made. This kinda makes his channel feel more sketchy and AI like. Or more like an industry plant sorta thing, ya get what i mean?

His actual content mainly talks about pull up cues, techniques, or different variations. He's done a lot on how to unlock your first pullup and how to increase your numbers. I beleive hes also given out free workout splits in his videos (they were just okay). He talks about much more calisthenics stuff... nothing too crazy. The thing is his videos just feel off. Theyre paced weirdly and sometimes arent clarifying on much and feel very shallow. Sorta like when you ask AI a question and get that response... ya know? Its just the response and nothing else, but you always gotta ask it to clarify. Sometimes hell take minutes to actually start talking about the topic and his phrases and way of talking just feel very unnatural and unintuitive. Especially for a fitness channel with the intent of teaching mostly beginners. And for the actual imagery, its always the same exact character... everytime. No matter the angle or pose, it doesnt change and looks identical. He's had a fat and skinny version of his character, but thats about it. I doubt most artists can draw that well. Its a pretty detailed character from what I seems to me (to be honest, I am awful at art though).

Theres been quite a few hate comments ive been able to find after seeping through the comment section. They mostly make fun of it and call it AI slop, or are being skeptical about it being AI.

1pygac8,Do others find it hard to build lean mass with bodyweight movements?,"And I'm not talking about ease of progressive overload or anything like that. I personally use weights and harder variations.

Overall I've had a lot more success using isolation and machines as a primary means to actually build muscle, and keeping bodyweight compounds ""strength focused"".

Like with pulling, i've had a lot more success training with a cable machine + bulking than pull up variations/weighted for the same volume + bulking. 

Similarly for all other planes of movement and muscle groups.  Dips for example, I think it's really not that easy to make dips primarily a ""chest based"" movement. Yes, I've grown from dips, but primarily in smaller muscle groups like triceps and front delts, which always remain the limiting factors in my dips due to dipping ""works for my body"".

Training with only bodyweight and weighted bodyweight movements really did not allow me to gain more than a few lbs a year without the vast majority being fat.

Since I've switched to including more supplementary isolation movements I've managed to make quite a big jump in my lean mass gain, and I am also getting stronger, faster, of course.

1pycrn0,Creating a Planche Routine,"I'm aware that the planche journey is going to be long, especially considering that I'm currently 184 cm and 80 KG, I'm expecting over a year. 

My front lever journey was pretty wacky and I did a lot of stuff that really slowed down progress. The only reason I got it in a reasonable time frame is because I had a high starting point (I could do inverted L-sit pull ups, and hold the advanced tuck for a good amount of time) and it's a brute strength skill.

My starting point for planche is lower, and I can't really bs my way into it by just getting strong at an overhead press movement, so before I start my journey, I want to create an actual plan, rather than arbitrarily changing what I do whenever I'm unhappy with my progress.

  
**Frequency:** 

I'm for sure training planche at least twice a week, I'm not worried about tendons and other non-muscle stuff, and I can always reduce intensity if needed. I see some people recommending training planche as often as possible, I wanted to get more opinions on that. Can I train it multiple days in a row, or would it be better to train every other day? Of course, this is assuming I'm able to train it at this intensity.

In addition to frequency, how much weekly volume is recommended? I'll note that I'm going to be decreasing all of my pushing work for as long as I prioritize the planche. 

**Exercise Selection:** 

There's four exercises I'm considering: Isometrics, planche push up progressions, Maltese press, and scapular push ups. Isometrics I plan to include on each day I train planche, and scapular push ups don't seem like they would be insanely fatiguing, so I'd train them with high frequency as well.

How well do planche push ups translate to the hold? Would I be better off doing more sets of isometrics, and maybe just 2 sets of push ups? Also, how do the push ups compare to the Maltese press? Are they different enough to include in one session, or should I train them on separate days?

**Straddle:**

How wide is the standard straddle planche supposed to be? I'm working on my middle splits ,but my straddle is really bad. I tested it out with front lever, and its for sure easier than the full thing, but it's significantly harder for me to do than the one leg. With that in mind, is the one leg planche the best route for me? What I did for front lever was one leg extended, and gradually straightened the other leg, until it was fully extended. The other path I'm considering is doing a bent knee straddle. Once my flexibility increases, I'll straighten my knees and widen my straddle, until I can hold it for an acceptable amount of time.

**Bands**:

I wanted to know if instead of working through all the progressions, if I can jump straight into the full thing with bands. My school gym has a lot of bands of different levels of resistance. I assume I'll need multiple bands at the start, but I'd rather do this so I can practice perfect form from the beginning, rather than focusing on flattening my back separately from full hip extension, body alignment, etc. I would also have a much better understanding of how close I am to the full planche.

At the moment, I can’t do a single pull-up. I can only hang from the bar without much happening other than some suffering. I’d really like to change that.

1py1go1,Looking for help with refining my routine to include more flexibility and mobility centered work.,"Hey gang. I've been doing body weight fitness for some years now, and I'm looking to build out a better plan in order to (hopefully) see some real progress this coming year. I feel as though I have been on a plateau for a long time, sort of just working on maintaining more than anything. 

I have a few goals in mind, since that is helpful in building a program. 

**Goals**  
*Increase Pull ups (Current max of ~10)  
*Increase Push ups (~20 so far)  
*Press Handstand  
*Improve flexibility and mobility (The Big 5)  

What I am having the most trouble with is sequencing, I think. So far, this is my plan for the new year: 

**(Specialization 8-12 weeks)**  
**MWF:** Pull Up Mastery (Kboges), Legwork, Conditioning, Handstands, flexibility  
**TTS:** Push Up Mastery, Legwork, Core, L-sit, Flexibility  
**Sunday:** Free day  

**(PPL 3 day split 6-8 weeks)**  
*Push, Press work & handstands, Front Splits & Pike*  
*Pull, L-sit, Middle Splits & Pancake*  
*Legs, Core, Back Bends*  
**Repeat**  

So, where I'm struggling is with programming specific exercises and sequencing and trying to reduce redundancy. For the pull up and push up mastery, I won't be changing variations, and I am hoping that will help push my numbers higher, finally. 

I haven't had to think too much about flexibility and mobility work because I was following Patrick Beach at Commune Yoga, but I had to let my sub lapse, and I'm trying to be more deliberate about what I train on a regular basis anyway. 

If anyone has had any luck with specific sequences of drills for any of the above, I'd love to hear it. Also, if this looks like a bad plan, I'm open to suggestions for changes. ",1766953460.0,2,1,bodyweightfitness,fitness

It felt good to build strength, but eventually building mileage and getting faster at my primary sport eclipsed my strength routine. I have two little kids (1.5 and 4.5), so I have to be ruthless with how I use my time, so strength fell off my weekly schedule.

Well, I've had persistent hip and low back pain for more than a month now. I can run through it, but it's holding me back and being in pain just sucks. I have kind of an intuitive feeling that strength training will help.

I know I will need to fix my back pain by then and also carry serious strength with me.

After checking what the muscles are called im also guessing push ups help with one of the chest muscles but the only one that comes up are the pectoral major but nothing else . 

The only basic exercises I know are squats , sit ups , push ups , lunges , wall sits , whatever lying down and pulling my feet up is called (it does something for core muscles but forgot what the excerise is called ) , obviously stuff like running/walking , plank and probs one or two I forgot .

The only muscles that the Google thing mentioned were deltoid , pectoris major , triceps ,biceps brachii short head , biceps brachii long head , serratus anterior, brachialis, external abdominal oblique ,brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis longus, bicipital aponeurosis. But i swear theres chest muscles and shoulder muscles missing .

Next workout is 6 reps, etc till 8 reps. After 8 I up my weight and go back to 5 reps)

I’ve just gotten to a point where it doesn’t feel sustainable. Joints are sore and I’m exhausted. This is the first time I’ve encountered this wall and I think I went a week or two beyond a deload / active recovery / rest period.

So the question is how should I deload? What’s a good way to give my CNS and joints a break but still maintain the good habits built till now? More specifically do I just do the same RR but significantly reduce weight? What percent reduction?

So recently I started getting into Calisthenics, and I'm looking into certain exercises. I found this really awesome workout called the dead hang, and I've been starting out with a passive dead hang, where I let my body just hang there and allow my spine to decompress, and my goal for now it to be able to do one pull-up.

Though I am coming across some sources that seem to be a bit beyond my understanding, as it seems there are different opinions on how to approach dead hangs. For example:

1- I saw this video where a guy talks about the [5 dead hang mistakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoCv4fN_m9s), and the guy seems to say that the shoulders shouldn't touch the ears when doing a passive hang, which seems a bit odd to me since my shoulders naturally touch my ear when I just let my body hang. If I pulled my shoulders up a bit, wouldnt that turn into an active hang? If so, then what's the correct way to do a passive hang?

2- I know that using an thumbless grip allows one to focus more on the back muscles and creates a better mind-muscle connection, but every person I see do a dead hang uses a closed grip. Which kind of grip would be better for someone who is starting out from?

1pu2w8r,Bodyweight exercises are relatively non-taxing despite high-intensity/difficulty,"To clarify, I'm not particularly strong at bodyweight exercises. I'm talking about performing dips/push ups/pull ups etc. in the 5-12 rep range.

The thing I find strange is a lot of people talk about how tiring a full body session is with bwf, 6 sets per muscle group sort of thing.

Even when pushing to failure on *EVERY* set, a bodyweight program just has a minimal effect on my overall fatigue or feeling for the day. I'm meaning failure where I actually cannot complete another rep without my form completely breaking down.

1pu1wb4,Strict bar muscle up feels impossible (female),"background info: 34 yo female, 5’4”, 140lbs. body fat stays around 15-18%

  
I have been following a bar muscle up program for over 6 months, and I still don’t have a consistent bar muscle up. The most I’ve ever had was one, maybe 4 times. 

  
Do any other women struggle with the BMU? My background is in power yoga, CrossFit, and weightlifting (10+ years). i am concerned that muscle mass is a huge factor holding me back. I’ve found calisthenics and heavy lifting don’t mix well for my current goals, which are calisthenics based. I still don’t have a stalder press (though I can press to handstand, and reverse stalder press on parallettes.) I can usually link 2 ring strict muscle ups.

  
I’ve focused on negative BMU, chest to bar pull-ups, (weighted and non), pullovers, Aussie rows, banded strict BMU, and more. Days when I feel ”heavy” are especially tough.

So I took the RR and just added some exercises I wanted on there (I believe). 

As I understand it, you turn bodyweight exercises into a circuit by doing them back to back without much rest. Is that correct?

If I took this routine and did that, focusing on intensity as well (doing them as fast as I can), would that carry the benefits of both HIIT (conditioning, cardio) and strength?

1ptqpry,Single ring tricep extensions,"Anyone here ever tried doing a ring tricep extension using just **one ring** instead of the usual two? Most of the time, when I see people doing ring tricep extensions, they’re always using a pair of rings, one for each hand. That seems to be the standard setup and what’s commonly demonstrated in tutorials and workouts.

However, when I experimented with using only a single ring and gripping it with both hands, the movement actually felt **more comfortable and surprisingly more stable** for me. I felt like my elbows tracked better, my shoulders were in a more natural position, and I could focus more on loading the triceps instead of worrying about controlling two separate rings. The single-ring setup also felt more balanced, especially during the eccentric portion of the movement, where stability can be an issue for some people.

I’m not sure if this is just a personal preference, a mobility thing, or if there are actual benefits to using one ring versus two. Maybe it reduces the stability demand slightly, making it easier to isolate the triceps, or maybe it just suits certain body mechanics better. On the other hand, I can see how using two rings might challenge stabilizers more and have its own advantages.",1766485889.0,7,2,bodyweightfitness,fitness

I've always heard conflicting info on whether or not to do pullups alongside chinups. Some source say to keep them separate, as it will 'confuse' your body and its better to focus on just one. Others say its fine. What do you guys think?

I'm thinking of running cycles, and since I've been doing pullups as my main pull exercise, I'm gonna do a deload then start a cycle of weighted chins. Is this how most people do when they run separate cycles for these two exercises?

Lastly, has anyone ever or currently still run dropsets for weighted pulls/chins/dips? I gave it a go 2-3 months ago and haven't stopped. They're insane for a pump and really force you to push to failure. I primarily do them to save time. From what used to be 40-50min workouts to what is now 15-20min.

I'm training to build up my strength, athleticism, and power, not too worried about hypertrophy. So I'm doing bodyweight for 3x5. 

I'm using harder and harder variations to progressively overload at the moment, as some bodyweight exercises can still challenge me in 5 reps or less. Once I master the advanced variations, then I'll add weight. I'm using bodyweight as a building block, then loading it to keep building strength. 

And of course, one arm pushups and pistol squats are the peak of bodyweight pushing and squatting, but I have one problem; will they both build muscle and strengthen proportionally?

I've heard balance is a major limiting factor, and of course balance is a good thing, but will I still be building strength and the myofibrillar hypertrophy that comes with it? This is especially true for pistol squats, as I've heard they can get hard to progressively overload and I don't wanna be that guy with a nice upper body but chicken legs, even if my main goal is to get stronger.

1ps04xl,More reps in less sets vs more sets of fewer reps?,"Is there a significant difference between 2 sets of 12 reps vs 3 sets of 8 vs 5x5?

Also related,  what about doing many short training sessions per week vs fewer, but longer training sessions?

The reason I ask is because I have trouble choosing between an Upper/Lower split and a full body routine.

When I train full body, I cannot do more than two sets per exercise otherwise I'm exhausted to the point of nausea by the end of the workout.

  
Conversely, I can handle the duration of an Upper/Lower session much better, even when increasing the amount of sets. However, this reduces the frequency I train each muscle group, which will lead to slower results.",1766299736.0,1,12,bodyweightfitness,fitness

Just wanted to share something interesting about my bodyweight journey. I used to be a lot more fit when I was younger, I’ve not worked out much these last two years of college blah blah blah.

1prov0x,"Is ""constant tension"" the true key to long-term injury prevention?","Hey everyone,

I wanted to start a discussion on the balance between Progressive Overload and Technique.

We generally agree that ""good technique"" is the #1 priority for preventing injuries and keeping us in the game for decades. However, to progress, we have to push harder: adding reps, sets, or load. The issue arises as we get closer to fatigue. We talk about ""technical failure"" (stopping when form breaks), but I’ve noticed that technical failure isn't usually binary. It’s not that Rep 11 is perfect and Rep 12 is broken.

Instead, form degradation is subtle and gradual. It is often hard to perceive objectively in the moment. You might not be ""cheating"" explicitly, but you might be shifting load slightly to tendons or using momentum just enough to bypass the muscle. When we chase numbers (Progressive Overload) without a rigid standardization of form, we subconsciously become ""more efficient"" at the movement rather than stronger. We bounce a little harder, we lock out a little longer to breathe, and we shift stress from muscle bellies to tendons. Over years of training, ignoring this subtle breakdown is often what leads to chronic injury.

To solve this ""subjectivity"" problem and protect the joints, I’ve been experimenting with a stricter standard for what counts as a rep. Before adding more reps or weight, I have to be able to execute the set following these three rules.

(Note: This applies specifically to dynamic movements like squats, push-ups, dips, etc. Static holds/isometrics are excluded as they naturally maintain tension.)

**1. Strict Tempo (5 Seconds per Rep):** Use a metronome or phone app to beep every 5 seconds. This forces you to control every centimeter of the movement and eliminates momentum entirely.

**2. Make an Active Pause in the Hardest Position:** No bouncing out of the hole. Pause where the leverage is worst, but keep it active. There must be muscle tension. If you are resting on your joints or flexibility limits at the bottom (hanging loosely), it doesn't count.

**3. Maintain Constant Tension (No ""Joint Resting""):** Eliminate the ""micro-breaks"" we tend to take at the easiest parts of the movement. Example: No hanging out with locked knees at the top of a squat, or hanging out in a locked-out plank position during push-ups to catch your breath. If the muscle isn't firing, the rep is over.

Once you can hit your target reps with these strict constraints, then you have earned the right to increase the load.  I believe this approach is the best safety net for longevity. 

By eliminating the ability to ""rest on your joints"" (lockouts) and removing momentum, you ensure that the load is strictly on the muscle tissue, not the connective tissue. It effectively turns a dynamic rep into a ""moving isometric."". Also, by forcing a 5-second tempo and constant tension, you artificially *slow down* the rate of weight/rep progression. You make the exercise harder muscularly without increasing the load on the tendons. This forces you to spend more time in the ""safe zone,"" allowing tendon adaptation to ""catch up"" to muscle strength.

However, as a natural consequence, your current numbers (load/reps) will likely drop dramatically. This means that this method is not good for strength sports like powerlifting, because the goal of those sports is mechanical efficiency (utilizing leverage, momentum, and elastic recoil to move the maximum absolute load from A to B) whereas this method intentionally places you at a mechanical disadvantage to prioritize muscle isolation over weight moved.

However, moving less load/reps doesn't mean being weaker, because you are increasing the internal load on the muscle fibers even while the external load decreases. By removing momentum and the 'slingshot' effect of your tendons, you force the muscle to generate maximum tension through every millimeter of the movement, often resulting in a greater hypertrophy stimulus despite the lighter weight. 

So what do you think? Do you train with continuous tension, or do you find that locking out/resting is necessary for high-volume sets? Does this strict tempo kill your numbers too much, or is the trade-off for safety worth it?",1766265102.0,7,8,bodyweightfitness,fitness

✓ Push up- to reach psuedo plance push up of RR
✓ Dips- atleast unlock it now i can do 5-6max
✓ Legs pistol- unlock it i can do 3max
✓Rows- reach horizontal i can to 6-7max

1pqtggt,Most comfortable weighted vest for all day wear?,"I have a weighted vest that I got in a craigslist gym package deal, but it hangs pretty loose and isn't very comfortable if im doing anything but walking in it.

For those who have used weighted vests and/or other clothing,

What might be the best options for weighted clothing wear? Ideally looking for stuff that I could wear for several hours or more each day while doing normal routines (cooking and chores, working at a desk, etc)

Im steering clear from the cheap Chinese sand bag options, but also dont want to spend a ridiculous amount of money for something like this (300 dollars is insane to me for a weighted vest - might as well start looking into tactical plate carriers at that point, at least they'd have more than one function)

Any thoughts?

EDIT/UPDATE:

For reference, I'm 6'2"" muscular male, about 200lbs. I've been weightlifting more than a decade. There's scientific evidence building that wearing weighted clothes can trick your body into thinking you are heavier than you actually are, providing benefits to metabolism, bone density, etc.

I absolutely am not here to sacrificing physical activities in place of wearing a vest. I'm looking to add a vest for my own experimentation on maintaining mass and metabolism in a calorie deficit.

I understand some might be concerned about additional stress from weight, but I hardly think something like 20lbs would make a massive difference in low impact activities such as walking up and down stairs or doing chores around the house. Im sure the stress isnt any worse than squatting several hundred pounds under a barbel, and I have no intention of doing high impact activities like running with a vest on.

The question of this article is what vest would be comfortable for longer periods. I guess that would equate to not being bulky, having an even weight distribution, and being relatively stable on your body for various movements.

Do we have any solid picks for that?",1766171175.0,0,19,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1pq54k9,Full body vs split routine – looking for advice to manage volume & time,"Hey everyone,  
I’d like some advice on how to adjust my current training.

I’ve been training at home for a while now and I’m currently alternating two full body routines (A & B), training 3 days per week. I’ve been consistent with them for quite some time and I’m happy with the progress so far.

The issue is that I’m reaching a point where, if I want to increase intensity (more reps and/or adding external weight), my workouts start to get very long. Right now each session is taking me around 2 hours, and if I keep pushing volume the way I am, it doesn’t really feel sustainable or practical.

Because of that, I’m wondering if it might be a good idea to switch to a split routine (training different muscle groups each day, still 3 days per week). The idea wouldn’t be to lower intensity, but actually the opposite:  
– keep workouts shorter  
– be able to push higher intensity, more reps or even added weight, without the sessions becoming endless

Any split recommendations for 3 days a week that still work well with calisthenics?

1pq4upq,Frequency and splits of High Rep training.,"While I do find the idea of high rep training really appealing, and have experimented with it with success, the thing that has always been an obstacle for me was the management of frequency. I always see high rep and high frequency go side by side, but I don't find it sustainable for fatigue management, but I could simply be doing it wrong.

1pq18x3,Recommended Stability/Mobility Focused Routine,"I have been doing a barbell routine for the past few months and have built up a decent level of strength (5x305DL, 5x255SQ, 5x,155BP, 10+ pullups, 10+ dips). I tweaked my knee the other day and went to see a PT. She took me through a number of balance and mobility focused exercises and I left feeling very worn out from doing some very simple movements with light weight. Small muscles that I had forgotten I had were sore.

I love my barbell routine for it's ability to add strength relatively quickly with great simplicity. I plan on continuing this routine eventually, but I think I need to take a break and do something more focused on stability and mobility. Besides just raw strength I want to be able to control my body through a full range of motion (e.g. do a muscle-up), or maintain stability regardless of position (e.g. hold a handstand). What I currently have in mind is doing a 6 week calisthenics or kettlebell progression and then a 12 week barbell progression and alternate back and forth. I would like the calisthenics/kettlebell routine to incorporate isometrics to some degree, as I identified some weakness there during my PT session.

I have 2-3 mornings per week with around 1hr to do a focused workout. I can also incorporate small 10 minute sessions throughout my day. 

I'm leaning towards just starting the Recommended Routine and seeing how it goes. In your opinion, will the RR adequately fill this gap in my training or would another routine be more helpful?

1pprsw3,Workout split advice for Freestanding HSPU Goal,"Hey everyone, 

I’m currently trying to get my first freestanding handstand push-up, and I feel like I’ve hit a frustrating wall — not because of shoulder strength specifically, but because of how my overall training is structured. I’m at the point where I can hold a floating pike position and, on good attempts, press into a bent-arm position with some control. So I’m clearly close. The problem is that I feel limited in how often I can train HSPU without other muscle groups becoming the bottleneck. Ideally, I’d like to train HSPU 3–4 times per week since it’s such a high-skill movement and benefits from frequent exposure. In reality, doing that consistently leaves me feeling wrecked everywhere else. 

The biggest issue is recovery. If I train HSPU that often while also training legs and pull muscles, I end up too sore and fatigued for quality handstand sessions. My back, arms, and sometimes even legs feel like they’re constantly interfering with my ability to push HSPU progress. At the same time, I really don’t want to just stop training legs or pulling movements altogether. That feels like a short-term fix that creates long-term problems. Right now, I’m running a full-body split. On most days, I start with HSPU work while I’m fresh. After that, I usually include some combination of: a squat pattern a hinge a vertical pull a horizontal pull a horizontal push plus a few isolation movements That said, I rarely hit everything in one session. Most days I’m choosing a subset depending on how I feel. Even with that flexibility, I still feel like the accumulated fatigue from full-body training caps how hard or how often I can push HSPU work. What’s especially frustrating is that this isn’t a new problem for me. Over the past few years, 

I’ve tried pretty much every split you can think of: upper/lower, push/pull/legs, full body, skill-focused days with lighter accessories, even phases where I intentionally deprioritized legs or pulling volume. No matter what, it feels like something always ends up holding back my HSPU frequency or quality. I’m starting to wonder if the answer is less about finding the “perfect” split and more about how people who actually got the freestanding HSPU handled this exact tradeoff. 

Did you accept slower progress in other lifts for a while? Did you reduce volume dramatically elsewhere? Or did you find a split that let you train HSPU often without everything else falling apart? So I’d really like to hear from people who’ve already achieved a freestanding HSPU: What split were you running when you finally got it? How often were you training HSPU specifically? Did you keep full leg and pull training, or intentionally scale those back? If you were in a similar “almost there” stage, what change made the biggest difference?",1766067154.0,1,4,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1pprm36,Lack of flexibility blocking skills despite following Recommended Routine,"Hi,

I follow the Recommended Routine consistently. Strength is progressing but my flexibility is clearly holding me back.

Main issue is posterior chain stiffness. I cannot fully extend my legs because of tight hamstrings. This blocks skills like L sit, pistol squat depth, and leg transitions for handstand entries. I am not even sure splits are realistic for me, but I want enough mobility to freely move my legs and control positions.

I am very rigorous and can commit to daily work if needed. I am looking for a simple but effective mobility routine that I can do every morning and evening, focused on hamstrings, hips, and overall lower body mobility, with a clear progression logic.

I would like advanced practitioners to clarify what actually works long term. Static stretching vs loaded stretching. Frequency. What to prioritize if the goal is skill transfer, not just passive flexibility.

Current level:

First Pair  
Pull up progression: 5 strict pull ups, currently stuck  
Squat progression: Barbell squat 70 kg 5x5

Second Pair  
Dip progression: Weighted dips 5 kg 5x5  
Hinge progression: Deadlift 90 kg 5x5 or RDL 80 kg 5x5

Third Pair  
Row progression: Weighted inverted rows 5 kg 3x8  
Push up progression: Diamond push ups 5x12

From an experienced practitioner perspective, what mobility work actually transfers to L sit, pistols, and handstand leg control at my level, including overall body mobility, and how would you structure it on a daily basis?

1ppnok0,Question about the legs part of the recommended routine RR,"Hey - beginner here, and I've been on the RR for a week now, already seen some gains! I've lifted weights previously, but only for the past year, and I'm experimenting with where I am at with the progressions.

I've got a question about the leg section. It says:

**'Note: If you have access to barbells (and a squat rack), we recommend you** [**learn how to use them instead of the squat progression.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine#wiki_integrating_barbell_squats_and_deadlifts) **after you have perfected the basic squat.**

  
and then similar for the hinges:

**'Note: If you have access to barbells, we recommend you** [**learn how to use them instead of the hinge progression.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine#wiki_integrating_barbell_squats_and_deadlifts) **after you have perfected the basic hinge progression.'**

  
As i'm doing the routine in my local gym, I have access to weights, barbells etc. I'm already capable with squats and hinges, so should I just forgo the progressions and do these with incremental weights? 

  
Later on it says;

# Integrating Barbell Squats and Deadlifts

The basic process works as follows:

* You replace the squat progression by *squats*, 3 sets of 5 repetitions.
* The 1st and 3rd workout of the week, you replace the hinge progression by *romanian deadlifts (weighted)*, 3 set of 8 repetitions.
* The 2nd workout of the week, you replace the hinge progression by *deadlifts*, 3 sets of 5 repetitions.

Thus, every week, you will be squatting thrice, romanian deadlifting twice, and deadlifting once

Before you do your ""work sets"" it's a good idea to warm up with less weight for squats and deadlifts: first do a bunch of reps with just the bar, then add weight and do another (slightly smaller) bunch of reps, then add more weight and do another (smaller still) bunch of reps, etc. until you are at the weight you want to be squatting at.

As for actually selecting a weight: the first time, start with just the bar. Then add weights in increments you feel comfortable with. Try to add some weight every workout at first.



So I'm basically just doing squats and deadlifts as above, and increasing weight as needed and ignoring all the progessions for these sections?

 I'm also wondering how people work on their flexibility as there isn't much focus on this in the routine. I'm quite a busy single mum, I can manage fitting this in 3 times a week, but anything on top of it is a put of a push at the moment, however I can probably do some stretching at home if kids / space allow ha ha!",1766054154.0,9,7,bodyweightfitness,fitness

I have been doing pull ups, chin ups and dips for almost 5 years now. In my first year, I managed to get from 1x20kg additional weight to 1x50kg in one month. 

As ridiculous as it sounds, my strength increased in other aspects, i gained mass over these 5 years, maintained my pulling strength on pullups and chinups but never got over 60kg additional weight. 

My lifegoal when it comes to weighted pullups would be to do 80kg x 5 one day. However it feels impossible to progress for a year or two, especially if you want to keep up with other body parts.

I’ve been doing handstand push ups as my vertical press after the main work, which is straddle planche + straddle planche press - Now, i’m sort of wondering if I should maybe be pressing on towards the 90d hspu instead of regular hspu.

I think the best course if so would be to move from hspu to 90d eccentrics to 90d reps right? fair step, that’s how i got to hspu in the first place.

I think my questions to those listening are:

Does 90d hspu still count as a vertical press/ does it matter?

Would not doing regular hspu mean potentially losing it if i’m just doing 90d hspu (/eccentrics)?

i know the 90d does obviously press back up to handstand once you’re doing the full movement but yeah i’m just thinking out loud

should i be swapping hspu out for 90d hspu? should i be doing some sessions pressing on towards 90d and some sessions to keep improving the regular hspu?

is it even worth pressing on to 90d or is it better to do more regular hspu

https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/s/sZCH858EvO

I just wanted to thank everyone who commented. It genuinely helped me a lot, and the fact that everyone was so supportive, put me in a positive frame of mind and served as motivation. Since then I have made considerable progress. Something which felt impossible at the time.

I am still eating clean, staying away from takeaways, sugary drinks and chocolates (my biggest weakness). I am hoping to continue this trend.

As for push ups, I was leaning against the table at the time and doing 5 sets of 10 reps. Shortly after the post I was able to progress and complete 5 inclined push ups (about 6 to 7 inches of the floor). It was difficult to begin with but I was quickly able to make progress and complete 5 sets of 5 reps.

The biggest milestone however came today. I was able to complete 5 reps of proper pushups, sticking to my form and even felt good doing it.

I think I’ll stick to inclined pushups for now to build strength and complete max reps of full pushups every other day as not to overload my body and risk injury.

I can’t believe the amount of progress that can be made in just 11 days.

1pn55lx,"How to introduce muscle up, planche, and front lever progressions from my starting point","Hi all, here is my current situation. I do a variation of the Recommended Routine 3x a week. 

The only movement I cannot do in some variation is the reverse hyperextension because I get a really noticeable pain in my lower abdomen/groin any time I attempt it. I have been trying to prehab/rehab my groin/core weakness but this is also why I don't squat or RDL with as high weight as I could based on leg strength alone. 

I've instead usually done regular back extensions or other movements that focus on my obliques like Copenhagen plank progressions or side lifts on a Sorinex machine. My lower back doesn't seem to love normal back extensions.

With that in mind, I'm finally making consistent progress on the rest of my movements and would like to start progressing towards the 3 movements/strength skills in my title, not in a rush at all. 

1. Should I start working on the progressions for one of these rather than 2 or even all 3 at the same time? I know that calisthenics in general but especially these types of movements can be taxing for the CNS so I want to train with sustainability and injury prevention in mind first and foremost. 
2. Should I train any/all of these on off days? Or for example should I start switching pseudo planche push ups for planche progression movements on one or more of my 3x RR days? 
3. Would it be more effective to replace one of my 3 RR days with focus on one or more of these movement progressions (both from a recovery standpoint and just personal experience/skill development)?
4. Any specific pointers on strengthening core in a way that prevents or limits groin strain? I've tried a variety of exercises but it seems I keep running into a wall where I eventually feel some tightness or discomfort. I have a history of inguinal hernias (both sides have been repaired) in case that helps inform your response. 

Re number 4 specifically, I have spoken with doctors and PTs and gotten no useful guidance besides rest and not pushing past pain. I've literally taken months off of training (especially core training) from injuries or other obstacles, but the discomfort always comes back, even when I start really slowly.

I can do 4 sets of 7 pushups on the floor. But I am doubtful about my form as I see many types of recommendations of perfect form all around the internet.

When I do pushups, and the way I feel best (and I have observed myself in a mirror), is when I keep a straight body without any posterior pelvic tilt. I go through the full ROM of the pushup where my body remains stable and straight throughout, no arching in the lumbar spine, no pressure whatsoever. But my belly fat or whatever it is, hangs loosely. That doesn't arch my spine, though. When I push myself up from the bottom position, I feel my ab region reactively brace/contract. But, while going down, although my body is stable, I don't feel it in my abs or obliques. I have gotten stronger this way.

But, when I watch tutorials around the internet, I see almost all bellies flat yet effortlessly. Some also say to bring the belly button towards the spine to keep the body straight and engage the core. But my body is already straight, and I have gotten stronger the way I practise.

I love training calisthenics and bodybuilding, but getting older, working a full-time job, and being a full-time dad and husband, I just don't have the time or energy to devote to long workouts with isolation exercises and the like. In trying to find a balance between life and training, I discovered Kyle Boggeman aka KBoges on YouTube, who recommends working up to daily training of three hard sets each of an upper push, an upper pull, and a leg movement, plus an optional 1-2 accessories. 

With his guidelines, I've narrowed my training down to:

1. Upper Push Exercise x3 (Pushup, Dip, or Pike Pushup) 
2. Upper Pull Exercise x3 (Pullup/Chinup, Rows, or Face Pulls)
3. Single-Leg Squat Exercise x3 (Each Leg)

On alternating days when I do bilateral squats, I'll add in a posterior chain accessory. Typically, I'll superset my pushes and pulls in the morning before work, and perform my leg movement(s) GTG style throughout the morning before lunch. Works well for me, but it's definitely a contrast to the maximalist workouts I did when I was younger.

In particular, this article questions the popular injury prevention study among soccer players that I've seen brought up a few times by YouTubers. It says that the study compared programs that included multiple exercises that could have led to injury prevention and the link to Nordic curl wasn't strongly proven. 

I also found the explanation around how it can be detrimental to sprint performance seem intuitive. For example, while running our muscles aren't constantly in tension and during the Nordic curl they are. I run 30mpw and try to incorporate some harder runs and strides, so this is interesting.

Anyway, it's all over my head, especially when they talk about the different muscles/muscle groups. 

I personally like the exercise, and I'm doing an easier progression of it, and if feels good. I also see how it can be risky if I try to do a harder progression, so I'm careful to progress slowly.

1pkengj,Are Wall Planches Any Good?,"I was thinking, when I was learning the handstand hold, I was using the wall a lot. I worked on my frog stand to improve my hand balancing, as well as got into chest to wall handstands and gradually brought my leg forward from the wall until eventually I was able to leave the wall. I then worked on treating both legs as one unit and took them both of the wall into a straight handstand, rather than a split leg. After I got that I started to learn how to get into one freestanding. 

I was wondering if a similar method could be applied to the planche? I'm no where near a full planche yet, and it's really a focus right now, so I'm pretty weak in the position. I got into a chest to wall handstand, then simply started leaning forward, and my legs would slide down the wall. Like I said I'm no where near a planche yet, so I didn't get that far down the wall, but I felt a lot of load on my shoulders.

Has anyone tried this before? The goal would be to keep leaning forward until eventually I could just get off the wall. I could also do this with planche progressions, like I could straddle my legs and bend my knees and do this until eventually my knees slide off the wall. But I want to know if these are any good before considering doing them whenever I decide to start training for the planche. ",1765501905.0,3,12,bodyweightfitness,fitness

However I have difficult time figuring out the dimensions. As having the structure welded is also costly and time-consuming, I really want it to be done correctly. It will stand outside, under a shed. I will be very grateful for your advice!

1pjcxpl,From unfit mum of three to 5 pull-ups at 40 — thank you RR community ❤️,"Hey all,
I just wanted to post a small milestone and a big thank you to this community. One year ago I was an extremely unfit mother of three, about to turn 40, and honestly had no idea where to start with exercise. I stumbled across the Recommended Routine, read all the stickies, and decided to give it a go.
Fast-forward one year and today I managed 5 pull-ups. I still can’t quite believe it. They’re not the prettiest reps in the world, but they’re mine — and I’m ridiculously proud.
I’m not posting this to brag. If anything, I want to say: if you’re lurking here wondering whether the RR can work for someone like you — it absolutely can. I had no background in fitness, no strength, no flexibility, no time… and it still worked because the structure is solid and the community is generous with advice.
What helped me most:
Trusting the progression and not rushing
Showing up consistently, even on the days I felt tired or discouraged
Keeping the mindset of “I only have to do today’s workout”
Reading success stories from people who started from zero (so here’s mine to pay it forward)
To everyone here who answers questions, posts progressions, writes guides, or just cheers people on — thank you. You’ve genuinely changed my life for the better.
And to anyone on the fence: you can absolutely do this. Start where you are, be patient with yourself, and let time do its thing.

1pifafm,Been doing calisthenics for a few months now. I want to improve my routine/ask for advice.,"Hi! Im relatively new to calisthenics. So far it’s been pretty good but admittedly I’m a perfectionist so I want to improve as much as possible. For context: I (male) am 5’9” and like 135/136lbs. A bit on the leaner side, but with decent muscle. A few years ago I was sickly thin—like 117lbs. I hit my college gym for a bit and bulked up to 130. But I honestly just like more compound exercises so I switched to calisthenics. Plus my gym is always SUUUPER crowded, to the point where I can barely use the machines I want. And I wanna do those cool handstand exercises one day lol. 

Right now, my routine is the following: 
-3x8 push-ups (with various forms, I have one of those cool push-up boards)
-3x8 Mike Tyson push-ups (saw a vid of them and they’re just fun to do)
-3x6 pike push-ups 
-3x9 resistance band rows
-3x8 curls (20 lbs dumbbell)
-3x8 hammer curls (with resistance band)
-3x8 assisted pistol squats (for each leg)
-3x8 Bulgarian split squats
-3x8 calf raises 
-3x8 ab roller
-plank for as long as I can 

I usually do this as a full-bod workout 3-4 times a week. As for equipment, I have a few dumbbells (highest lb is 25) and good resistance bands that I can adjust to make workouts difficult. I do plan on getting a pull-up bar, but my doorway is wider than most so finding an adjustable one that’s affordable has been tricky. 

As for diet. I don’t really micromanage it, but I’d say on average I consume like 2,500+ calories a day, and like 60ish grams of protein. I also take creatine daily. 

So with that said, what can I do to improve? Reps, workout splits, etc? Where can I find affordable equipment like an adjustable pull-up bar, and dumbbells? (For a small apt.) Is there anything I should be doing differently? Even fun pointers y’all have learned. Any and all advice is appreciated, I genuinely can’t wait to achieve a nice, not TOO bulky, toned build. Calisthenics has been great for my mental health too cause it’s something I can do at home, therefore having no excuse to “skip a day”. Plus it’s always nice to have something to work towards.

1phus4h,Front Lever Raise Progressions or Inverted Deadlifts?,"Just in case you don't know the exercise by name, when I refer to front lever raises, I'm talking about starting in an active hang, and pulling yourself with straight arm into an inverted hang. You then lower down while still keeping your arms straight. At the halfway point, you're in a front lever. I've also heard this be referred to as front pulls, and front lever press. 

Inverted deadlifts are where you start in an inverted L sit, which is like an advanced tuck front lever but the knees are straight so your legs go straight up. You then thrust into an inverted hang, then lower back down into the inverted L sit. This exercise also involves straight arms. 

I was doing inverted deadlifts because I wasn't strong enough to do full front lever raises, and when I tried doing it in a tuck or advanced tuck, it was hard for me to engage my glutes and bring them to the bar. I tried doing one leg advanced tuck one leg extended today and I was able to do them for multiple sets.

I find front lever raises to be a really fun exercise to do, in addition to also feeling great, and I'd imagine there's greater carry over since I can eventually perform the exercise in the full front lever position. I train back twice a week, and so I'm for sure doing front lever raises at least once a week, but I want to know if I'd be better of dropping inverted deadlifts on the second back day in favour of doing front raises twice a week, or if I should stick to doing each exercise once a week.

I've taken a week of deload twice, increased volume to 3x6+5+4, but that seemed to make me fail the next session at the fourth or fifth rep of the second set. My form has been getting worse, I'm barely getting chin to bar.

My nutrition is okay I think, increased my weight \~10kg (some of that was creatine).  
I sleep for about 10 hours a day too.

1phk33w,Fun Little Experiment for Hand/finger Growth,"Background:   
Recently I've gone down the rabbit hole of hand/finger growth. So far i've come to 2 conclusions: You either do work with your hands for years (possibly decades) on end, or you get super specific equipment. 

Option 1 really isn't that feasible since I don't want to just start working in construction/start rock climbing just to grow my hand, and i'm too cheap for option 2

My idea:   
In a tierlist by RogerC on youtube he mentioned doing finger pushups as a way to grow your hands/fingers. Since it seemed like a pretty low entry method I decided to try it out greasing the groove style for a few months. and check my results (assuming i stay consistent). 

Some form tips to emphasise which part of your hand is stresed more:   
if you want to target the larger muscles (the ones that bring your pinky and thumb together) then:   
1) place your hand on a flat surface  
2) Spread your fingers as wide as you can  
3) elevate your hand so that the only contact points are your finger tips  
4) \*important\* try to keep all fingers as close to parallel with the surface as possible  
5) actively focus on bringing your fingers together  


If you want to target your index middle and ring:   
1) place your hand on a flat surface  
2) make a claw grip like you would see in a old chinese kun-fu movie  
3) elevate your wrist so that the only contact points are your finger tips  
4) focus on keeping your weight on the three fingers, using pinky and thumb as supports  
NB: even when elevated, I don't let my knuckles drop below the first finger joint. doesn't feel the best for me, but others can try it if safe. 

And that's it!

I workout 4 days per week but I dont do legs. I used to work them out at the gym before switching to callisthenics and I didnt bother. They are in a good condition as I walk a lot very often and played football until last year. However now I want to train them again

My goals as far as legs are concerned are for them be athletic and practical and stremgthened. I would like to grow them a bit in size as they are quite skinny but my end goal is not having really big legs. I prioritise having athletic legs that will be strong and more practical (posture, running, endursmce etc).

My dilemma is what I should choose for my legs. I am willing to spend 45 to 75 mins for them weekly. I am aware thay free weights are considered the best for size. However due to the fact that i own some dumbells and that sprinting is really good for fitness I thought about combining some basic leg exercises with dumeblls at home with running. 

My questions are: which routine better aligns with my goals? Can I avoid the gym completely flr my goals?

1ph1ntj,Grease the groove or micro workouts?,"I don’t like committing to big workouts, so I’ve been  hearing a lot about micro workouts. The past few months I’ve experimented with both grease the groove and micro workouts. 

From my understanding, grease the groove is every hour on the hour doing very light 1-3 minutes workouts. Pushups, squats, curls, ab rollouts. A few reps of each. Some sets I skip the curls, or skip the squats. I might skip a few hours of the pushups, then do multiple pushup sets. Either way, I’m hitting over a hundred reps of each per day, and it’s super convenient and I feel great all day.

However, I’ve heard you can’t build muscle this way. So after a whole month of doing this, I tried doing micro workouts which seem to be more intensity, and only 3-6 times a day, and each muscle group is only worked once or twice a day because you’re going pretty close to failure.

I like both, but I want to make sure my time is spent properly. My goals are to build muscle. It sounds like grease the groove is not the way if I want to build muscle.

I need to focus on progressive overload and actually building muscle. Is this possible with micro workouts? How would I structure that, and would I need to take more rest instead of doing it daily?

Both micro workouts and grease the groove has many benefits such as helping with skills, helps metabolism, burns a lot of calories, helps blood sugar regulation, and overall just being active all day, it also fits in my schedule perfectly as I workout from home and can fit in multiple small workouts in a day.

In the meantime, I just wanted to get some ideas or guidance about what it could be, or if other people have had similar experiences. I’m taking everything with a grain of salt.)**

Hey guys, I’ve been doing RR for a year now. After the summer, I took a break for about 2–3 months. I wanted to get back into it in October and started doing about 50–60% of the RR I was doing before my break. I worked out three times a week from mid-October until the end of November.

My last real workout was on a Thursday in November. Everything felt fine during the workout and also the day after. But three days later, when I wanted to do my third workout of the week, I felt really tired, and my muscles were still sore and had no energy. I could still do my usual pull-ups, but they felt heavy, and my muscles tightened up very quickly. I stopped the workout because I thought my body needed more rest, but after that, the soreness never went away.

It’s been two weeks now, and I still have sore muscles in my arms and upper back. When I do anything physical, it gets worse. It’s not a sharp pain, but it’s an annoying, persistent soreness.

Do you know what this could be? Have you ever experienced something similar?

I track my diet: I usually eat around 3000 calories a day, 170–190g of protein, I drink about 3 liters of water daily, and I have an office job. I’m also currently writing my bachelor’s thesis, could it be that my body isn’t recovering because of stress?

Edit: I forgot to mentoin that i supplement 3.5 gramms of creatin per day since Oktober. Because of that, my weight increased from 83 - 88/89kg at 186cm height.

Current strength levels (approx.):

* Push-ups: \~40 reps
* Pull-ups: \~10 reps
* Dips: \~10 reps
* Plank: not sure yet

I also train **boxing 3 times per week**, so recovery and smart programming are important for me.

My main questions:

1. How should I **structure my weekly calisthenics training** alongside boxing?
2. What would be the best **beginner-to-intermediate routine** for my level?
3. How does **progressive overload work in calisthenics** (reps, sets, leverage, tempo, added weight, etc.)?
4. How should I track progress?
5. Should I focus first on high reps or harder progressions/weighted calisthenics?

I have access to all basic equipment.

* Build more visible muscle and strength
* Improve athletic performance for boxing
* Learn calisthenics skills in the future (muscle-up, handstand, etc.)

In the past I've been training some martial arts / swimming so I was quite active , still ride my exercise bike / lift some weights at home.

However I was never able to do 1 proper push up , like ever , my arms just bend in ways you cannot describe they aren't even bending symetrically to the other each has life of it's own.

  
Imagine you do chair dips  , while dipping my arms would go to the sides or perform weird 180 degree motion sometimes more than 180.

Same goes for pushups , they're laughable , even knee ones.

  
I was looking for some ideas how to give my arms maybe more core strenght but people like me were told to never do full motion of exercises due to these joints.

So I came up with idea of just taking my legs on chair / bed and doing 1/2 of pushup face near floor and just remaining in this position untill I collapse to floor then rest and repeat. Would It even do anything to make my arms stronger over time or am I wasting my time?

  
I do not have these types of issues with other exercises , let's say bicep curls using 11 lbs /  7,5kg dumbbells , I can do 25 reps with right and a little bit over 20 with left arm so I'm not that weak I think , google says beginners do like 8 reps , average person 15.

  
However other exercises like over head extension with dumbbell for tricep with just one hand is again almost impossible for me to do , with two at least I can somehow manage arms not bending in weird ways.

  
Are my triceps just this weak causing the whole arm be so weak and this can be fixed with exercises or will my arms just always be so shit? I mean even while cooking I can hold pan that weights idk 2,5 lbs let's say with 2lbs chicken and veggies in it and I need to sometimes put it down because holding it in one hand for like 30sec straight forward is just kinda impossible to me.

1pg3jya,Straddle Front lever,"Hi, I’m a 179cm 65kg dude who is currently working towards his straddle front lever, and I’m coming off the one-leg front lever progression (not the version where the tucked leg is fully tucked, but more like an advanced tuck position). Lately, I’ve been trying to include at least a few straddle attempts in every training session because I really want to get used to the feeling of the position and build the specific strength needed for it. The main problem I’m running into is that when I actually try to hold the straddle, my hips immediately pike upwards, and my body kind of folds instead of staying straight and controlled.

It honestly feels frustrating because, in my head, I know what the position is supposed to look like. I try to think about keeping my legs wide, squeezing my glutes, and bracing my core as hard as I can, but my hips still seem to win the battle and lift up almost automatically. It feels like I’m fighting my own body to stay in that straight-line position, and I can’t tell if the issue is that my lats aren’t strong enough to pull my hips into the right position, or if it’s more of a core weakness where I just can’t resist the pull of gravity once my legs are spread.

Sometimes I feel like my shoulders are working overtime while the rest of my body just kind of gives up. My scapula feels like it’s trying to stay depressed and pulled down, but my midsection doesn’t cooperate, so my whole shape collapses into that pike. I’ve noticed that even when I start from a really controlled pull-up and slowly try to lower into a straddle, I still lose the position pretty quickly, which makes me wonder if I’m missing a key strength base somewhere or if it’s more about technique and body awareness.

I’ve also been experimenting with different cues in my head while I train. I’ll think things like “push the bar down,” “lock the elbows,” or “show your chest to the ceiling,” hoping that one of those thoughts will suddenly make everything click. Sometimes it feels slightly better, but most of the time I end up with the same result: hips rising, legs dropping a bit, and me coming out of the hold after just a second or two. It makes me feel like I’m super close, but still far enough away that it’s hard to see when it’s really going to happen.

Current height 165(2025)
55kg(2023)

Started training for it back in 2023, while i was very new to calisthenics and only doing finger assisted oac. Progressed using 3 fingers(2nd,3rd and 4th), to eventually only 1 finger(3rd/2nd). I never really did much weighted chin ups, band assisted stuff, negatives. Did a lot of finger assisted work and got the oac on both arms in 3 months.

Fast forward 2 years, i stopped training the skill entirely, and was focusing more on fl and cross work. Gained more fat and muscle, now weighing at 66kg. I managed to attain it once again using the same method i did 2 years back in a single month.


Many people say to do weighted chin ups and get it up to 70-90% of your BW, but my weighted game barely goes to 50% even now.

This is how i got the oac, but it doesnt mean you should absolutely follow everything i say, and the same goes for other calisthenics literature. For me, weighted chin ups were not necessary.

As soon as I put my wrists over the bar, it feels insanely uncomfortable and I lose it almost immediately. My fingers also aren’t really wrapping properly — it feels like I’m more “resting my wrist on the bar” than actually locking in a true false grip.

I’m also getting a lot of pressure/pain on the outer side of my wrist and it’s leaving red marks after even short attempts. No sharp injury-type pain, just intense skin/tendon discomfort.

• My pulling strength seems way ahead of my grip/wrist conditioning

• My fingers probably aren’t doing enough of the holding

• I might be cheating the false grip on the pull but failing on hangs because of endurance/tendon limits

I’m currently practicing on a straight bar. I haven’t used straps, and I haven’t taped either. I’ve mostly just been trying full hangs and short false grip pull attempts.

My questions:

• Is it normal to be able to muscle-up before you can even hang?

• Should I be doing assisted false grip hangs first?

• How much finger involvement should there be early on?

• Is wrist pain/marking normal at the beginning or a sign I’m doing it wrong?

• How often should I train false grip without frying my wrists?

Any progression advice would be hugely appreciated. I really want to build a clean, reliable false grip instead of just muscling through it.",1765046905.0,1,3,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1pfv59j,1 year calisthenics physique progress 39y/m dad of 2,"Hey all,

as a 39y old dad of two kids I just wanted to show my physique progress. Started calisthenics a year ago with sets and reps of the basics (pullups, dips, pushups, rows). My initial goal was a ring muscle up and now I'm kind of ""dreaming"" of a front lever. Physique wasn't in the center of my goals (still in there of course) but I believe it improved a lot as well.

Overall this is also a ""thank you"" to the body weight and calisthenics community here and on youtube where I've learned a lot. Books like the omnipresent ""Overcoming Gravity"" have also been a great help. I have so much fun learning about the topic and about my body specifically. Unlocking stuff like the muscle up, pistol squat, etc. is just cool as f\*ck when it happens.

During the year if seen my orthopedist a couple of times because ego caused me to overtrain (shoulder, triceps, back; but nothing serious) :) That might be the number one thing -for me- at this age overall: rest more than you think.

A couple of people asked about my routine. Look in the comments where I detailed my current split. Overall I plan my routine around: Pullup variation, Dip, Ring Pushup, Ring Inverted Rows (all of those twice a week). The rest is more variable. I think one of the videos that got me on that track initially was one of the full body ring workout videos from Fitness FAQ on YouTube.

Few people asked or accused me of taking gear ... Half of me feels offended, half takes it as a compliment. But nah guys, absolutely not my cup of tea.

I never actually saw progress before I stopped and started again even tho I was consistent for over 3 months. maybe I did it wrong, watched the wrong guide or was just impatient, but whatever. i needed help so I looked up how you actually do it the right way and came across a fitness influencer with the name Leo Wang (amazing physique btw). he had a workout plan in which he stated that the best way to do it is by doing drop sets. which means you start by doing a hard exercise (or variation of the exercise like weighted pull-ups) for only 3-5 reps two sets with a short break in between, and then do a easier one with more reps and less break in between (might be the opposite with the breaks, can’t remember) 

Is this how you actually progress fast in cali? He reasoned it by saying that when you always move to a harder progression the body will adapt to it. If there’s a better way let me know, Im in need xD.

These routines typically have 16-20 sets on each pull, push, core, legs workout day, each workout done once per week.

1pf37we,Handstand Push Up Progression Advice,"My weekly shoulder work includes deficit chest to wall handstand pushups, ring dips, Bulgarian ring dips, lateral raises, and I grease the groove with pike lift offs. The dips I do 3 sets of each, on different days, lateral raises are also 3 sets twice a week. With the pike liftoffs, I just do a single lift off with the goal of getting slightly higher, until I eventually lift into a bent arm handstand, I'll then reprogram from there.

Now the handstand pushups are freaky. I do 5 sets of them twice a week, first 4 sets only 3 reps, final set I take to failure, then I hold the bent arm handstand for as long as I can. I was thinking logically today and started to question if 10 sets of 3 each week is too much to recover from, and whether or not holding the bent arm handstand at the end is worth doing.

The other thing I'm unsure about is the deficit. Is it better to sacrifice range of motion for more reps, or to continue doing them at a deficit for low reps, but maybe reduce my sets since each set is basically failure (if I went for a fourth, I would probably start to arch my back or walk up the wall to assist myself). I'm wondering if I should switch to floor handstand pushups until I can do freestanding HSPU, then I can do them freestanding once a week and on the other day to them on a deficit against the wall.",1764960523.0,2,2,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1pewhmn,"Can you Superset Dips, Pull Ups and Pike Push Ups?","I'm currently following my own workout routine which is largely based of the Recommended Routine (An absolutely fantastic piece of work) and FitnessFAQ's ""Perfect Calisthenics Workout"" that can be found in their YouTube channel.

Here is the link for reference, at the end of the video their is a quick summary of the whole routine: https://youtu.be/7J3RaEYTPvM?si=tzGACWv_hu0_fHIG

However, instead of following a full body split three times a week, I modified the routines so I could do them as an Upper/Lower Split 4 times a week.

My current Upper Days look something like this:

-5 sets of 5 reps of Pull Ups and Dips performed as a superset with a 90 second rest after Dips.

-3 sets of up to 15 reps of Rows and Push Ups performed as a superset with a 60 second rest after push ups.

-And Finally, 3x15 of Bicep Curls and Tricep Extensions with Dumbbells (I'm currently at 2.5kg per dumbell).

I like the amount of intensity and the duration of the workouts so far, as well as the way they integrate into my schedule and available equipment.

I would like to add pike push ups into the routine so I can eventually do HSPUs, but I still want to work on my dips. So I'm currently looking for a way to practice both at the same time. 

These are the ideas I came up with so far:

-Pairing Pike Push Ups with Dips and Pull Ups as a superset. So for example pike push ups, then pull ups then dips, rest, repeat. Both Dips and PPU are pushing movements so I believe their would be some conflict there.

-Doing them in different sessions, so on Monday I would do Dips and on Thursday I would do dips.  I would be hitting them each only once a week, but since they have some overlap, it might be fine.

-Increasing the rest time for the first pair (triplet?)
So it would be PPU + Pull ups + Rest + Dips + Rest then repeat, or it could also be PPU + Rest + Pull Ups + Rest + Dips + Rest and then repeat. This would allow more time for the muscles to recover from fatigue but it would increase the duration of the workout, which I rather not do if possible.

1peojbv,How do you deal with the aspect of progressing much slower than someone else?,"Has anyone experienced something like this? Ive been training bodyweight for 7 years now. By far my most consistent exercises has been pullups, i genuinely dont think theres hardley been a single week in the last 7 years where i havent done atleast 3 sets of pullups. Most weeks atleast 2sessions. 

Realistically, i havent really progressed them past my progress two years in, where i could do sets of 5 chinups with 30kg, maybe 14 pullups in a row with strict form. 

Pretty much every session i go close to or at muscular failure. When i say failure i mean no matter how hard to try, i cannot complete another rep. My diet has been mixed but always high in protein 100grams+. I fluctured up and down around 75kg at 6ft. A session usually looks something like 5x6 thorarcic pullups or something like that, always trying to overload while keeping good form. Most of my other exercises havent progressed massively either but pullups is the most consitently trained (had elbow injury so couldnt do push)

I recently started introducing my friend to bodyweight fitness. He was pretty much untrained. 

We both weigh the same (80kg), similar builds, both eat the same and he actuslly sleeps worse than me. Despite this he is now cranking out 4 sets of 12 pullups with +10kg up from barely doing 2 in a row within 10 months, almost as good form as mine, despite us following very similar routines and him actually working out less than me. I mean i literally gave him the routine.

Im honestly so incredibly demotivated in our differences of progress despite me actually putting in more effort than him so i cant help feel like giving up. I understand i could probably make more progress if i dialed in my diet and mixed training up more, but both those aspects are worse for him, so thats whats confused me. I actually got my hormones checked last month - free T bang in the middle of average. No deficiencies.

I understand people go at their own pace, but i was always told (by people on this very sub) how hard you train is much more important. ",1764918168.0,12,31,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1pegtnl,OAC Training Twice a Week + Pelican Curls?,"I train OAC twice a week. Day 1 is eccentric focused. I simply do 3 sets of holding the one arm lock off for as long as I can then control the eccentric as I begin to descend. Day 2 is concentric focused, where my pulling arm is on the bar, and my assisting hand only uses my index finger, and it pulls on a ring that's hanging pretty low from my bar, to really limit the amount of assistance. Again, I do 3 sets. After assisted one arms I do 3 sets of eccentric Pelican curls.

The OAC training is to failure, the pelican curls are not. I was wondering if this is too much tendon stress / if this greatly increases my risk of injury. Would it be better to not take my OAC sets to failure, only train OAC 1x a week, only do 2 sets, etc?   
  
I don't grease the groove with them, and I train them first, not when I'm already fatigued. Specifically I do bodyweight chin ups, then I do assisted lock offs to eccentrics my putting my assisting hand on my pulling arm. I'm also including the pelicans because I feel like they put similar stress on the biceps to eccentric OAC's. I can do 10+ reps of eccentric pelicans, but I haven't tested the concentric yet because I do them right after OAC's. 

Lastly, between days I train biceps, I get 3 full days of rest. As in I hit biceps, the next 3 days I rest, then on the fourth day I hit them again.

1pe7noc,Can’t do push ups,"Hi all, 

Looking for some much needed advice. 

I am a 30 years old male, 5 feet 7 inches tall and currently weigh around 109kgs. I’m a fat bastard, I’m aware. That is why I’m here. 

I’ve been fairly active for the vast majority of my life. I enjoy playing basketball, have trained in a bit of Muay Thai when I was younger and enjoyed a run every now and again. This all changed however after I start my new work. Long hours, office based and take away food apparently don’t go well together, who knew? 

I am now looking to shed the weight and improve my general health and fitness. This is not the first time I have been on a weight loss journey. In the past I have lost up to 30 kilograms, but I did so only doing cardio and eating clean. I suspect only doing cardio is partly the reason why putting the weight back on didn’t prove to be much of a challenge. 

This time around I want to do it differently. As well as doing cardio, I also want to increase my upper body strength. Something I have always been very conscious of. Ever since I was young, for some reason, perhaps genetics, my legs have always been sturdy and strong. My arms however, not so much. Till this day I’ve got noodle arms. I want to change this. 

Instead of going to the gym, I figured I’d start with pushups at home. Much to my surprise, I can’t even lift my fatass off the floor, let alone do a proper push up. I could at least do pushups before, granted the form was terrible, it was better than nothing. Now, I can’t even do that. I’m baffled at myself. 

I am currently in the process of building myself up. I’m doing incline pushups against the table, paying particular attention to my form. 

My question is to you all is: 

How should I plan my progression? I’m currently doing 4 sets of 10. 

Will what I’m doing and push ups in general help build deltoids, biceps and forearms? 

Any tips at all? (Aside from loose weight, which I’m trying to do)

1pczxxs,Feeling tired - triathlon training on top of rr,"Hello,

I've been following the rr since april. Injured in july, had to stop for a month, now I'm still going strong.  
I feel progress, even though it's not crazy transformations that you can witness on social medias.

How ever in parallel I train 4/5 times a week, mainly swimming (2x) and running (2x), cycling at least once.

Even though it is in majority low effort to moderate training, I'm feeling really tired this past weeks.  
Last week after the rr training (woke up at 6:30am) and after a 40min swim session at noon, felt so tiring during work that I had go to sleep at 3pm lol. Lucky for me I was at home.

I try to eat a lot of protein, I dont count calories but usually 2 shaker and 160gr of chicken / 100gr of thonu / skyr / 2 eggs in the morning...  I try also to drink a lot of water and sleep minimum of 8 hours.

Does anybody feel the same way when doing more sports beside the rr ?  
I'll really start training harder for an upcoming triathlon in 2026, so my preparation will be even more exhausting starting of january. With my current state, I'm looking to drop to only 2 sessions of the routine, and maybe only 1 during the triathlon preparation.

Thanks for reading :-)

1pcyf2v,The Ring Flag - under the radar great obliques exercise,"I came across this SaturnoMovement video, *“6 Calisthenics Skills to Learn with Gymnastic Rings”* ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2b-op8hm8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2b-op8hm8) ). Most of the skills weren’t really relevant to me, but I tried the ring flag exercise and ended up *really* liking it, so I wanted to share, since I never heard anyone mention it before.

Unlike the full human flag (which I’m not even attempting right now), the ring flag doesn’t require crazy coordination or push/pull strength, so I could jump straight in. It absolutely torched my obliques in the best way.

For some reason, most oblique exercises, like windshield wipers, just feel awkward and annoying for me. This one didn’t; it felt natural and satisfying, and finally gave me a way to hit my obliques that I actually enjoy.

Hope this helps someone else!

So I noticed that if I do muscle ups with say 20kg attached on the belt, and then I remove the belt, I'm literally flying off the bar on the next naked muscle ups. This makes sense because of neurological activations induced by the previous heavy set. 

This got me wondering if, when it comes to PR day attempts on the weighted muscle ups, it's a reasonable strategy to first start with some very heavy weighted pull ups, and then start climbing on the weighted muscle ups until the PR attempt.

Or even better maybe, start with 50% of 1RM weighted mu, then 70%, and THEN do some heavy weighted pull ups before finally attempting >90% of 1RM muscle up.

I haven't really tried this strategy because I'm often worried about preserving energy levels on those rare PR days, but yeah I wanna see how other people mix these 2 movements together for PR optimization, if that's even a thing.",1764735597.0,3,1,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1pcsxwp,Did my first muscle up today and I want to share my difficult experience in learning it,"Background: 7 months of calisthenics experience, spent 2.5 months training the muscle up

I am 18m 6'4 180 pounds and started bodyweight training because machines bored me. Its also important to note that I had been working out consistently 6-7 times a week for the 4-5 months leading up to the start of my muscle up training. 

Weighted pull-ups and explosive pull-ups helped me develop my strength, the resistance band version of both of these helped me develop my technique. Along with messing around on the bar to feel out the motion. 

In terms of weighted pull-ups I started at 10 pounds and ended at 45 for 3-5 reps and relatively quick speed. During my research I found an old post on this subreddit with a comment from someone which gave me the insight of a good ratio to determine whether or not you would have the strength to muscle up.

In my personal opinion what worked for this individual and myself was lifting for 4-5 strong consistent reps 10 pounds under 1/4 of your bodyweight. The amount of pull-ups you can do is (imo once again) subjective to height and bodyweight. Chris Heira recommends 15 pull-ups from his video 6 years ago which is number I can't do but a friend of mine shorter and lighter (by around 7 inches and 60 pounds) can do. 

The technique comes with time and feel but a tip that helped me finally get over the bar was to flex my abs right before and while pulling up. I find it keeps me at a controlled position while transitioning and at a good distance relative to the bar.

My target audience are taller people because I myself couldn't find tutorials by people my height. This whole post is a little choppy but I'm glad to clear anything up if there is a miscommunication. ",1764731054.0,40,15,bodyweightfitness,fitness

I am Male, an Australian (How it goin' mate?), 33 and have 2 beautiful sons (5 and 2) I am 180cm and \~85kg's and I would love to be able to keep up with my boys for as long as possible!

I have been bodybuilding / strength training for near enough a decade, and over this time felt my body become stiffer and less ""able"" regardless of how well my lifts were going.

Over the last 2 weeks i started what I was calling my ""reABILITY Phase"", to regain flexibility, mobility and of course be more ABLE with my body.

I am very OCD/Program-centric so I must have one haha! I have made this program myself with the help of much research, but I would love to have any feedback / guidance, as I am far from knowledgeable in this scene.

I should also note I love leg days (the sadist in me), and they're non negotiable in my program, but I would happily make any changes you guys/girls recommended.

**Some Current Skill/Strength numbers**  
\- I can hold a Free Handstand for like 3seconds, but its wonky.  
\- I can also do a few handstand push ups on the wall  
\- I can do about 10-12 Pullups  
\- I can do 25-30Push ups  
\- I can L-sit for 3/4seconds  
\- I can Crow/Frog for 4seconds  
\- I can Hollow hold with decent form for about 30seconds

I have no idea if that is enough to go off, but I suppose its my only known starting point - which i have worked out over the last 2 weeks.  
I otherwise have never done such movements before, but have been trying to do anything with the best form possible (at least for a beginner).

I am preparing for a PT test involving push-ups and crunches. My current max in \*good form\* for push-ups is 11 and crunches is 9. Pretty terrible, I believe. I am in my mid 20s and lead a pretty sedentary office job.

About a month ago I posted that i was starting over with physical fitness at 45, after a sedentary decade and with a busted knee. I could do 1 pushup at the time, and my form wasn't great.

Well, I figured a one month update was worth doing. I bought a bike a few weeks ago, and not only has that done wonder for rehabbing my knee, which is almost back to normal again, but it also helped me lose 4 kilos, or about 8 pounds in the last month, as well as go from 1 pushup to being able to do 9 in a single set (only 4 in the second set though, but i'm working on it).

1pbld41,"Are Calisthenics exercises really *that* compound, or am I doing something wrong?","Hey,

I am new on this subreddit. I started practicing Bodyweight Fitness a few months ago. I still consider myself a beginner, though I can proudly say I have already improved a lot.

I use some YouTube videos to design my workouts, but I mostly follow two books, one of them being Hybrid Calisthenics, by Hampton Liu - the gentle Asian guy with the black tank top, who also has a YT channel.  
At the risk of doing something too easy for me, I always start with very basic variations of exercises and then move on to harder ones - I am very thorough.  
Noticing I hadn't (ever) practiced leg raises, I started with the easiest Leg Raise exercise on the book: Knee Raises (in which you always keep your legs bent at 90 degrees). Hampton suggests I should be able to get to 30 reps of Knee Raises before moving to the harder variation: one in which the legs are partially straight.

  
Long story short: I can't get past twenty.  
Are my abs too weak? Actually, no, I think I already have a relatively strong core: I can easily keep more than one minute of forearm plank, I am already learning the *pseudo-planche lean*, and even aesthetically, my six-pack is quite definite.  
Nono, the problem isn't the core.  
The problem is with **the legs**.  
  
When I do Knee Raises, I feel like my calves are about to explode. And it is weird, because it shouldn't be an exercise for the legs, right? Yes, surely these exercises are compound, in the sense that even if they are ment to strengthen your core, they will also strengthen other parts of your body.  
But still, this doesn't feel right.

I wondered whether I have abysmal chicken legs. But no, I can do thirty deep squats, twenty narrow deep squats and I am learning Bulgarian lunges. I can even do a few of Pistol Squats (though not with good form, so I left them out of my routine).

What is going on here?

1pap2ug,What does recovery feel like to you?,"I'm training at home, with weights and calisthenics. I'm by no means a expert, but I try to work out 3 days a week.

Over the years I've heard many different stories, articles, myths etc about not working muscles groups in consecutive days because they need to recover.

Upper body and core, I feel I can redo my routines within 48 hours. But the problem I have, and have always had, is my lower body always feels like it takes 4 or 5 days to fully recover from.

Now, when I say, ""what does recovery feel like?"" I mean how long do your muscles take to stop aching? I can still feel the weakness in my thighs several days after.

I'm worried I'm pushing too hard, but at the same time I'm confident in my form. I'm fully hydrated before, during and after a workout, and I'll cold shower after a workout, yes I stretch before and after.

For more info, a 'Leg Day' consists of;
30 Second Wall sit 
3 x 5 Weighted Squats
3 x 5 Romanian Deadlifts
3 x 10 Forward Lunges (body weight)
3 x 10 Lateral Lunges (body weight)
30 second Wall sit 

Usually takes me about 30 minutes, and I lift 20kg dumbells.

As an aside, are there any recommend supplements, routines or methods you use to improve recovery time?",1764526259.0,8,18,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1paen0f,Struggling not to break form during PPPU,"I've been doing pseudo-planche push-ups on the floor, with wrists turned 90 degrees out (without parallettes).

I usually train them 3-4x6-8, superset-ed with rows, after a hard pull-up/vertical push EMOM superset. I like them, they are quite fun to do. But at the same time I can't manage to not have the form collapse in the middle of a set.

Here are the cues I try to keep by order of priority:

\* maintain the farthest forward lean I can hold

\* going up and down exclusively (no horizontal motion)

\* maintain posterior pelvic tilt (helps keeping the upper body parallel to the ground)

\* maintain toes pointed backwards

It goes well-ish for the first couple of reps then my brain feels overwhelmed trying to keep the first two in check, I seem to lose all mind-muscle connection and I completely let go of the latter two. Sometimes even my core loses engagement during the set. It's like the mental load is so great that the rest of my body gives up before the muscles actually being worked do.

I don't have the issue with push-ups, diamonds, or even decline ring push-ups, I am able to maintain form fine on these until reaching actual failure.

Any tips about that? Does it sound more like a strength or a weak CNS issue? Should I train specific isometrics to overcome this, or somehow just power through it and git gud?",1764496697.0,0,6,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1paekpo,Pullup form,"
Hey everyone, I’m looking for some honest feedback on my pull-up form. I’ve been training consistently for about nine months now. When I first started I could barely hang from the bar, let alone pull myself up, so this is a big improvement for me. I’m still not sure if my technique is solid, so I’d really appreciate any tips on things I might be doing wrong—like if I’m using too much momentum, not engaging my back enough, or cutting the range of motion short. I’m hoping to keep improving and avoid bad habits, so any advice or critique is welcome. Thanks in advance!

1paar9w,A Month Of Daily Horse Stance Holds or How I Relearned That Horse Stance Is Magic :,"**The Writings On Most Of It :**

A large part of my physical training is running ""every day"" challenges on myself for periods ranging anywhere from ten days at a time to very long term, years at a time.

My pushups every day streak is like that and could basically be described as for forever.

I'm also past six months of daily hindu squats at present.

But the thing I'm talking about today is horse stance.

With a set done just after midnight moments ago alongside a brief session of (you guessed it) pushups and hindu squats I've now done a horse stance hold of at least one minute's length every day this month of November 2025.

It was an experiment I considered worthwhile having had very good results in the past (the end of 2019/beginning of 2020) where all the leg training I was doing was horse stance immediately before bed and some of the time wall sits earlier in the day at the gym alongside otherwise upperbody workouts.

My legs got silly strong functionally at that point in time. 

I had a solid box jump weighing \~265lbs at 6', and in what may be my greatest feat of strength to date (though unquantifiable in numbers)...

I pushed a forklift stuck in a pothole it made in that before asphalt stage of unfinished paving in wintry conditions, this before coworkers got back around with a tow strap and pickup truck, and it seemed a tow strap and pickup truck needed job.

The look on coworkers' and manager's face was priceless upon seeing the forklift out of the hole - everyone knowing that I did it, that I pushed it out.

Again no leg work at the time but the two yielding isometrics, with horse stance being the bigger part of the equation...

So in the past I knew horse stance to work very well for me.

I wanted to see where it went doing them consistently again.

At present my main strength training is everything kettlebell (which I refer to usually as ""Backyard Circus Shenanigans"") - I lift them most days with the daily (trendy word here) ""non-negotiable"" daily pushups, daily hindu squats, and now also the daily horse stance alongside these calisthenics.

Horse stance never sounds that difficult on paper, and I'm not THAT MOBILE meaning it's a higher horse stance, not as deep as legs parallel to the floor, but also much deeper than maybe you might've seen Wim Hof do them.

I noticed recently that I'm launching kettlebells more easily.

I attribute that to all the shaking, meaning the muscles are firing of the horse stance hold.

Just the night before last I PR'd getting to a 2:10 hold, this my first time getting into the two minute counts.

But more importantly than strength gains (which admittedly are nice) is the fitness gains from this.

To hold horse stance for whatever time is long for you forces you to dig deep.

To effectively dig deep you must be conscious of, and control your breathing.

Effective breathing patterns make all things physical go more smoothly.

This month of daily horse stance holds has taught me to effectively breathe to squeeze more effort out of my sets and reps everywhere else ; with the kettlebell, with the hindu squats!

It's real noticable on the hindu squats.

I realized that a mix of both entirely nose breathing in and out and in through the nose with a little release of the breath through the mouth allows me to really flow for longer, for more reps per ser on the hindu squats.

There are opinions (old school/old timey) of hindu squats, deep knee bends (basically the western name for the same movement) being solid for training cardiovascular fitness.

In a positive feedback loop of hindu squats and horse stance I'm definitely feeling more fit, that I've more wind, and as time and reps increase on the two it's naught but even more of the same.

I'm glad I ran with the movement. It's given me a whole lot of results for 45:00 or less of this month...

Strength to ya,
""Horse Stance Is Magic""

**Form Things :**

Squeezing glutes vs just being conscious of trying to push knees outwards makes for a much higher intensity version of the exercise.

I mostly do a tai chi looking handful of arm movements while counting in my head as a means of consciously controlling my breathing - the time is on my cellphone's stopwatch set in front of me after I've just gotten into position.

  
My opinion and experience is that form improves towards the kung fu standard with practice so long as you're not riding really high.

  
Barefoot usually is better than jn socks.

  
(not form lol, but going here anyway) The practice started immediately before bed, but shifted by the second half of the month to whenever I felt like doing the hold each day.",1764482077.0,177,32,bodyweightfitness,fitness

For example, today I was on my 8th rep of overhead presses when I really didn’t feel like I could push anymore, so I struggled for about 5 seconds and considered it a finish. Though you could technically classify this as failure, I didn’t feel at all accomplished or like I actually went to real failure, at least not like I do when I have my PT by my side assisting me. I felt like I still had strength left in me to do more, even though when I did try to push myself again I just couldn’t get past that point. This pattern repeated itself with pretty much the rest of the workout, and now it seems as if my training has gone to waste.

1p9gg2b,do 10 pushups/10 sit ups actually make a difference?,"I'm not overweight - BMI is around 26.

Some days I cant get out of bed until 3-4 pm, but Ive been forcing myself to do something. like 10 sit ups and 8 push ups before dinner. 

A part of me is like, ""oh good, at least you moved"" and the other part says ""you're delusional, 10 reps won't change anything""

Do tiny reps like this actually lead to results if done consistently or is this just maintenance-level movement? I'm at a 2.5 weeks into 10 situps/ 10 pushups and it's hard. And I haven't lost weight or feel any different.

Im looking for truth and strategy. not fluff. if small steps matter I'll double down. If I need to push harder I'll face that too.

I very recently (a week ago) started calisthenics with the RR mainly for aesthetic (bodybuilding) reasons but also to prevent back pain and to benefit my sport performance. 

My main problem is upper body strength and my doubt is with the step in the pullups progresión from scapular pulls to full pullups. The things is, as far as I have seen with my research unto every exercise I do there are none that mainly work biceps (closest are rows, I do them incluned at the moment). And so, to people like me that start with pretty small biceps, it seems scary to start doing normal pullup (palm facing away from me) sets because even though they focus more on the back I have checked that I can in fact do a full pullup there is a part where my biceps and generally the arm tenses up like crazy and it just feels dangerous. 

So basically does the RR contemplate building a minimum of bicep strengthnecessary for pullups or should I work on It separately tonaboid injury?

1p8n7l6,Probably need to evolve my routine after 4 years.  Advice welcome,"So I’ve used a pretty basic but reliable routine since 2021, mostly doing weighted calisthenics for ”strength day”.  I’ve basically alternated between that and my boxing oriented session consistently.  Making little improvements as I go.

The sessions have basically looked like this:

**“Strength” Day:**  Barbell Bench Press, Weighted Pull Ups, Weighted Deficit Pushups, Weighted Inverted Rows, Weighted Dips, Weighted Ring Chin Ups.   

\-All full range of motion.  Sets have have varied but for a surprisingly long time I was doing 5 sets for each exercise.  Best results came for 3 sets though.   Other push exercises like handstand push ups aren’t in play right now but if I retire the bench press when I’m older that’s going in for sure. 

**”Boxing“ day:**  Shadow boxing focusing on footwork and defensive maneuvers, Heavy bag phasing through 3 different sized gloves, Treadmill inclined at 2 degrees running 3.1 miles (I crank the speed up at the end).  Then I put on a 30 lb vest and walk on the steepest incline possible at 3 mph for until my legs get inflamed enough 

\-I don’t designate specific days of the week I just let the pattern flow through out the year.  Amount of rest from one type to the other varies but I never do the boxing stuff the very next day after the calisthenics.  I sometimes have done the strength focus the day after boxing stuff becuase I prioritize ability over maximizing muscle growth.    Definitely don’t repeat either session until there’s been two to three days since the previous one.

———————————————————————————————————————-

Between other reasons that I’m asking for advice on figuring out a new approach, apathy has set in a bit.  And I’m annoyed at how long the sessions have gotten.  Especially with the day I’m doing calisthenics.

The amount of time I space out the exercises is the main problem.  Usually takes about 14-15 minutes before I feel right for the next exercise.  I’m not gonna do some PPL split because it creates an awkward feeling to me actually affects the boxing a bit, particularly in the shoulders.  Alternating push and pull isn’t gonna change.   

\-I guess I could just take the two set approach considering my priorities but there has to be a sensible way to condense things that works for me and doesn’t have an overbearing presence in the day.  I’ve tried doing my own research for a long time and there’s a lot of technical/science oriented information that’s neat but not helpful at the end of the day and I’m not concerned with optimizing.  

\-Thinking more long term and want to minimize over-stressing myself.  But it needs to worth it.

1p7dsrs,Need advice on weighted pullups routine: should I keep training weighted pullups daily or switch to a split?,"Hey everyone, I've started weighted pull-ups and I want to optimize my routine for max progress. I started daily, from 12kg x5 to 15kg x8. Next session: 15kg x8 again, but form was worse. I took 2 days off and after rest did 20kg x5 cleaner and easier than +15kg.   
What's better long-term and for now? Structured: light/medium/heavy split for recovery etc or  adaptive: train daily if feeling good and push until stall (e.g., +20kg x5 to x7, then drop to x4), then rest/deload. My main goal is to maximize strength as efficiently as possible**.**

I'm doing strength by lifting heavy and volume by lifting light but doing more reps.

So, my questions are : Do you change your routine often ? If yes, when and do you change your structure ? For example if you do a WOD monday and you are changing your routine, do you do another kind of WOD or do you change the type of exercise ? Also, how did you improved your max to reach the 30 ?

Edit : thanks for your advices. I'll start next week with 5 sets of 12 pull ups (4 min pause) mondays and fridays. I'll do 40 pull ups/40 dips then 30 pull ups/30 dips until 10 of each wednesdays and change the type of pull ups (close grip, large grip etc) to train the different muscles to do a pull up and have the necessary recovery between normal pull ups.

1p7ao7u,What Should I Do if Flexibility Limits my Straddle Front Lever?,"I know I have the strength because I can hold one leg straight, one leg super advanced tuck (foot level with torso, my leg is slightly more than 90 degrees) as well as rep out advanced tuck front lever pull ups. I know everyone is different and there's no standard number to convert between strength and skill work, but on the overcoming gravity spreadsheet, my pull up ratio is between the straddle and halflay front lever.

The reason I know flexibility is the issue is because I noticed the straddle front levers I saw online were pretty wide compared to mine, so I laid down on a bench, and checked how wide I could straddle, and it was laughably bad. I think for me, a halflay front lever would be easier than a straddle.

Of course, I'm going to work on my flexibility, but I don't know how long that would take. There's the frog front lever I saw in fitnessfaq's video, but I'm also not flexible enough to do that. The only thing I can think of is build up to a 30-45 second one leg front lever, then try a halflay straddle. As in I would do a halflay front lever but straddle as much as I comfortably can. It would for sure be easier than a halflay, but again, because of how small my straddle is, it still might be a bit harder than a standard straddle.

The reason I say this is due to having had several intensely physical jobs over the years and looking at how practical strength is developed for each of them. You in general don't do a small number of high intensity activities or a high number of low intensity activities, it generally ends up being a high number of high intensity activities (compared to what is actively used) and over the span of a month you gain the strength required to perform this long term.

I've been doing a routine of pushups, squats, rows, and single leg vs ups. I do the most of what I can of each exercise once with less than 30 seconds of rest, which for now is 3x4 pushups, 1x15 Bulgarian split squats for each leg, 2x8 inverted rows, and 1x20 single leg v ups. I do this twice a week with cardio on the days in between (I was originally doing more days a week but wound up injuring myself frequently and burning out)

However I just discovered the minimalist routine from this subreddit, and it seems pretty similar to what I'm doing except it's done in multiple circuits.

Because of this, I usually adjust my training when it gets colder either by reducing intensity, volume or deloading more frequently.

1p68rty,One Arm Handstand is Simpler than you think.,"This is not to say that it's easy, it's one of hardest skills out there. It's just simpler than most people make it. I learned the one arm handstand (consistent 5 second hold in straddle) after maybe 2.5 years of training it off and on. What I'll talk about specifically is going from one finger to the one arm it's self.

1. 

I should begin by saying most people get their first one arm handstand (a 3-4 second hold) on paralettes, blocks, or canes. I got mine on paralettes and are now working with blocks to move them to the floor. My advice would be to pick one of these 3 with canes being the easiest. You can also use a bosu ball, but I always felt like that was just cheating.

2. 

There are only about 3 cues when it comes to improving at the one arm handstand. How well are you stacked? Are your shoulders elevated enough? And are you making the right amount microcorrection in your hand? I'll leave a few links of some tutorials that explain this better. These are the only things you need to think about.

3.

As far as microcorrections go I recommend remaining fingertip heavy. I also  recommend you break your corrections down into only 4 directions, left, right, back, and forwards. of course you will need to do more than one at some point, but doing this allows your brain to simplify what you're doing and focus more.

4. FILM YOUR TRAINING

You need to film every rep to see your mistakes, diagnose the issue and try to correct it in your next attempt. Do that a thousand times and watch what happens.

5.

Stay consistent. I know it requires a lot of time and dedication, but you can do it, and I personally believe it's worth it. Also make your training fun, it doesn't have to just be attempt after attempt, you can include various things in your training.

1p62h5g,Is there a different training program one would need to unlock muscle ups and other pulling exercises in specific?,"Hi everyone I'm around 50kg, and a fairly lean physical frame (evidently)

I've been trying to gym for the past 3-4 years consistently mainly and am a vegetarian (if that has any relevance) and with the limited amount of time I have, I manage to always gym somehow thrice a week, twice in a bad case (excluding sick days and other stuff)

Since the start my only main goal has been to know how to do one muscle-up, but hear me out, I know you've seen a several 100 such posts almost every week with one new guy asking advice about the muscle up and stuff like that and it may be a boring question in fact...

But I'm asking this because while my goal was to do one muscle up, surprisingly I've unlocked at doing Leg Calisthenics before anything else.

For instance I can do one clean pistol squat with ease and even a sissy squat.... I mean yes I could do assisted ones since a few months and I kept working on that, seeing that as an answer

But that got me thinking, cause hey I don't necessarily squat very heavy as such or do anything very special for my legs, I've just been as consistent as the others maybe even lesser with them. Once I figured that I could do assisted sissy squats or assisted pistols, atleast I had an idea that it was the correct path to work on. And it's surprising I unlocked a leg movement before something else personally...

With my pull-ups, yes I started from zero (I could always do chin-ups), now I do like ~14 with ease, I'm learning the semi false grip a bit better as well... My core has gotten stronger, I can do like 3 sets of 8-10 hanging leg raises which are controlled as well and yeah I can dip comfortably for 4 sets of 12 as well..

There's all this stuff going great, in fact I probably unlocked my first L sit pull-up as well...

I may have been slower to this gym party than most others due to a few stomach related health issues and stuff during these years and it's only since the past year I've finally figured how to keep everything balanced along with my workout schedule... Sorry about that

For my pull day, I usually just so weighted pull-ups, ie: do 10-15kg in my first set, try to get around 4-5
Unload a bit more in the second and third based on how many reps I've got left in the tank...And finally I just got unweighted... I even do an extra set of pure controlled negatives if that helps more... The rest of my workout is more of stuff like machine rows, stuff for traps rear delts and biceps, even hammer curls recently to help the forearms if that was lacking.

Some days if I feel like it I'll try to hit more volume etc etc

But say I try to figure things like doing a high pull-up if that's the stepping stone to muscle ups, where your chest can hit the bar, I'm still unable to do it, it's not a strength issue surely and once I reach the top of the bar with my upper chest region kinda hitting the bar but that part of the pull-up is also kinda unstable so I can't do a lot there for too long...

So basically, I'm not sure on what else I can do, there's probably something I'm missing like a skill more than strength perhaps

Or maybe something I should incorporate into my workouts like how I did assisted sissy squats to get my normal ones and idk why or how my legs can do this while I'm unable to do a basic muscle up...

So thanks a lot, so tell me what it is I'm lacking, it may be the smallest of things, the biggest or something brutal, I'm all up for it thanks!",1764042708.0,13,16,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1p5xx76,"31M started working out about 6 weeks ago, now having difficulty doing pushups/weakness on right side","So to add to what the title says and give more specifics, I started doing 10 pushups about 6 weeks ago every time I ""lost"" in a video game kind of as a joke. I thought it would be good for me and a way to slowly get back into shape for the first time in like 7 years. I was doing 10 pushups at a time probably a total of 50-80 a night and eventually bumped it up to 15 at a time and adapted pretty quickly. I also got a pull up bar and for about 4 weeks now have been rotating upper body/core/legs every 3 days with some pretty noticeable improvement in my capabilities of being able to do ""more"".

Anyways, to my actual point. Early last week on ""arm day"" I was able to fairly confidently do 20 pushups+8 pullups at a time 4 times throughout the night. On Friday when arm day came around again, I noticed I had difficulty getting to 7 pullups and couldn't get to 8. Whatever, I decided to just say good enough and get down to do my pushups. VERY quickly around pushup 4, I noticed it felt like I had almost no strength in my right side (it's definitely my dominant side) and my left was definitely carrying the load and because of it, I could barely reach 10 pushups. I kinda just said ""oh well"" and settled for 7/6 pullups and 10 pushups a couple more times that night.

Today, being arm day again, I was hopeful that whatever was wrong had healed/resolved itself. Unfortunately, it seems it has not and again I was barely able to do 10 pushups which is honestly pretty discouraging considering whatever is going on is definitely going to hinder/negate any sort of progress I have made.

A couple things to note: First, the entire 6 weeks or so leading up to this while doing pushups before I had this issue, I would occasionally get a click/pop in my elbow while doing pushups. It was not a joint popping, more like a tendon moving but did not hurt nor cause any issue so just figured it was my body kind of adapting to the workout. Secondly, since last Friday when this issue first started, the ""tip"" top (I guess it would be the end of my clavacle on top of the shoulder) of my shoulder has been mildly tender with a sort of dull VERY mild ache, almost unnoticeable unless I move in a certain way. It is still tender now and earlier tonight when I was trying to do pushups, I heard/felt a ""crunchy"" clicking feeling in this exact area.

Sorry for the long post but just wanted to include any relevant details in hopes someone could help tell me what the hell is going on and what I should do about it/how I can continue to train my arms at home. I can still do pullups without any real pain btw, I just feel weaker. Thanks in advance!",1764029893.0,7,15,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1p5ryzp,Rings on a power tower?,"TLDR: Would doing basic vertical ring exercises be fine on a power tower? And how would I include them if I already do the recommended routine?

For reference I got a power tower that looks similar to this: https://a.co/d/ezSqxPY

Does anyone have experience on using rings on a power tower? I'm planning to buy some rings since I guess rings is like the highest priority when it comes to calisthenics. But looking online I don't really see a lot of opinions about it but with the few opinions online, they seem mixed.

An issue I see online is doing horizontal exercises like rows would tip the thing over, but since I mainly do decline inverted rows, I don't think it would matter since I'll be underneath the tower when doing the movement? I also got a pair of dip bars that I use for this exercise. 

Another issue I see is how narrow hanging the rings are, for my power tower, it's like 22 inches if you exclude the pull up handles, and what I see online it seems more than enough for hanging rings since 20 inches seems to be the standard. I'm also 5'9 so I don't think my arms needs to be wide.

And the last issue I see is doing advanced movements like muscle ups or skin the cat wouldn't work. I got absolutely no interests into doing these types of movements and all I care about is the basics.

I guess the few things I should worry about is the dip handle being in the way and the stability of it, but couldn't I just put the rings like a inch above the dip handle and for the stability, I could either put weights on the tower, or I guess work myself to be more stable on the ring exercises?

1p5kgyk,2 day splits proposition,"So I'm 49 yo and I'm exercising with my 13 yo son. We have rings, exercising very regularly (average 5 times/week, no fixed rest days because schedule).

The goal is pain free life for me and healthy body development for my son. So hypertrophy is a secondary goal, primary goals are tendons,  mobility, prehab, balanced body composition.

We do one exercise per muscle group, mostly 3 sets:

Grip/
Push/
Pull/
Abs/

Quads/
Calves/
Hip hinge/

Our split is upper-lower, but I'm not sure if something like 

strenght-endurance (Push/Pull/Hip hinge) - (Grip-Abs-Quads-Calves) or 

front-back (Push-Abs-Quads) - (Grip-Pull-Hip hinge-Calves)

could have advantages? What do you think?

1p5k7um,Tips for getting my first handstand right,"After practicing forever, i guess my hands have become strong enough to handle my body weight. Im in a position where i know 'how to fall' in case of failed handstand without falling face down to the ground. 

This is what i do as of now - I first find a wall, keep myself hands close to 1 leg distance from the wall and push up way up the wall with my face facing the wall. I then try balancing my core and shoulders and hands so i get the confidence to proceed. I then push one leg off the floor slowly and try to push the other leg off while the other leg is swaying on the other side so I can fix the centre of gravity making it easier. But the problem is im not able to find the balance when im trying to push the other leg away from the wall. I either fall or Im just not able to go away from the wall.

Please give me tips on how to get my handstand right:)

1p5iska,Some questions about one arm pushups,"Transitioning from archer pushups to one arm pushups, it's quite hard. So I am trying them on the wall with full ROM. Wall/incline one arm pushups cause a slight elbow pain, I guess this is because I am not used to the moment, and more strain is based on the elbow. So using elbow sleeves help a little bit with relieving the pain and I can focus more on the movement.

1. Are using elbow sleeves alright? (Actually I haven't bought any elbow sleeves atm, just using some bandage sleeves as elbow sleeves)
2. Is it alright to deep ROM using the edge of the wall to go deeper like deficit pushups?
3. Should we maintain scapula tension or is it alright to retract?",1763995284.0,4,4,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1p5hxzp,Does V-sit training come at the expense of strength training?,"Last week I unlocked the V-sit without using parallettes bars. It didn’t take me too long. What seemed to be mostly lacking was balance and a tiny little bit of strength in the back of my shoulders. 

However, while I think it is a V-sit, it’s not one where my chest and knees are very close to my body. As I find the move very beautiful, I want to become better at it. My issue is that I can train max 4 times an hour a week. To improve my V-sit, I think I mostly would have to work on my flexibility (my core is strong (dragon wings and rows to bar are easy for me)) but I am scared this would come at the expense of strength training (I am not so far anymore from the front lever I think but need to continue training hard).

Should I just replace regular squats completely with the Bulgarian split squats? Or do squats once a week and Bulgaria split squats once a week? Or is there a different exercise I should try? The only equipment I have is for upper body - pullup tower and cable. I have three stair steps that lead into another room in our house. I use that for calf exercises and the couple times that I’ve done Bulgarian split squats.

Even though Id like to progress on pbars, I do not always have access to the adequate equipment (basically a high and stable enough dip station, amd lots of weights) so am considering doing only weighted ring dips instead.

Is there an equivalence in terms of strength between the two - and if so would anybody have a kind of table that would allow me to compare equivalent weights on pbar vs ring dips?

1p59gir,"Is One-Arm Pushup a good ""main lift"" or more of a gimmick?","Are one arm pushups a good exercise to build a muscle workout around and plan to progress in (weight vest?) or would I be leaning much on the table by not choosing a different exercise for my chest/push volume?

A few years ago I trained myself to do one armed pushups. I still do them from time to time but don't generally train them; when I start it back up after a while I have to start with a foot way out sideways but I train back up to getting closer to a plank position. When people ask about it, I usually show them that it's waaaay less intimidating as a progression once you feel the difference that the opposite leg's angle makes. 

I'm trying to get my motivation back up to train after a couple months with a bad ankle sprain (conditioning and body fat responded the way you'd think). 

My main pursuit is climbing but since I'm recovering a lot of strength and conditioning after a long break, I'm adding off the wall strength training. I'm bad at programming, so I'll default to 5x5 rep schemes, with one exercise each per workout for push, pull and legs. 

Is there a good reason to skip 1A pushups for a main ""lift""? I had been thinking Pull-ups+Dips+Bulgarians for one day, and 1A ring rows+1A pushups+High step ups for the other day. On one hand (ha!), 1APs seem pretty transferable to climbing and I like the challenge it poses to the core, but on the other, I almost feel like the trick with the angle between my legs makes it cheating? As in it would be very easy to compensate, intentionally or unintentionally, with an easier leg position, and make the 1AP less ideal for the ""progress of when you could reliably finish the 25th rep"" scheme. 

What do you think, is the one arm push up a good exercise for filling in my push sets' volume? Or better as an accessory or garnish movement?",1763964464.0,75,39,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1p54bfp,Looking for pistol squat progression buddies!,"Trying to learn a pistol squat within 6 weeks and would L.O.V.E. to have people to share progress and struggles with.

Why 6 weeks? I know it’s ambitious… probably unrealistic… but I injured my shoulder and was advised by a sports medicine physician to stop all my barbell lifts and rest the shoulder for 6 weeks. I had always wanted to learn a pistol squat and figured this would be a great time to really focus on it and work on it daily.

The problem? Nobody else I know cares or knows much about pistol squats, let alone aspires to do one, and being able to share progress and struggles with others is something that motivates me to keep trying when things get hard.

Anyone else feel like sharing what progression you’re working on? Feel free to update this thread whenever you like. I wouldn’t be bored by even daily progress updates, no matter how small! That would actually help keep me going… I’ll comment below where I’m at…

1p50bnl,"Thinking of Buying Dumbbells for Weighted Calisthenics, Need Advise","I'm thinking of buying a cheap set of dumbbells to help with certain stretching exercises and to make exercises more challenging (specially leg exercises). I know this is mainly a calisthenics sub but I decided to post here because I'm thinking of buying this dumbbells primarily as a supplement to my calisthenics training.

There are mainly two sets of dumbbells available in my country that have caught my attention. Both are from no-name brands.

  
The first set is made of PVC, with a total capacity of 88lbs across two dumbbells. A kettlebell handle and barbell handle are also included, though I'm not really interested in those. Priced at a little under 72 USD it looks rather cheaply made, and I'm not sure how long it will last but it offers the best bang for buck and fits comfortably in my budget.

Pros: Cheap, comes with accessories, material will probably make them less noisy.

Cons: cheaply made, may not last long, I've heard online that PVC can stink, seems less durable, lower total weight means I may outgrow them eventually.

  
The second sent is from cast iron. The total weight capacity is a little higher at 105 lbs. It includes a large case for all your weight plates and handles and a barbell handle. This one looks like is better quality and it is more durable but it is also much pricier at 150 USD. No kettlebell handle is included. The price is a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to save if it means I get a better product.

Pros: Storage case included, looks more durable, higher weight means it will take longer to out grow.

Cons: Will probably be more noisy, may rust with time, a lot more expensive.

  
Now, I know nothing about dumbbells so I was wondering what would you buy if you were just starting out and have limited budget. Keep also in mind that I live in an apartment with somewhat limited space.",1763937783.0,2,13,bodyweightfitness,fitness

Plan is to do this only for 2-3 months alongside rehab, and then slowly bring back legs and full body with physiotherapists’ help. 

Background etc:
I used to do a lot of fun, skill and focus demanding training so also mentally I need even a bit of something like this as now everything else is cut off.

Knee is not super bad, and bends normally, but I wont strain it more than given rehab moves and can’t have any impact coming to it. Meaning handstands are out of question due to coming down phase. Its just risky.

Im already doing push and pull upper body strenght days (at gym), so pure strength moves are mostly covered. If there is fun ideas to add to those feel free to share, and of course skills training is a lot of strenght training as well and I might rather lower volume on pure strenght in order to add skills training that develop strenght as well. :)

I used the Armstrong pull up program to achieve 12 BW reps, then transitioned to training weighted pull ups. My PB 1RM is +50 lbs (+23 kg) (at around 140 lbs / 64 kg BW). I've been plateaued at this weight for more than half a year, and have even weakened a bit (maybe on a good day I can do a 45 lbs 1RM). 

My programming was 5 sets of 3-5 reps with at least 5 minutes rest at the time i was improving quite rapidly (and subsequently achieving my 1RM PB). I used weight that was close to failure, but not done to failure. For reference, I worked pull ups ONLY (no other exercises) twice a week, in addition to climbing twice a week. After hitting this plateau, I've tried changing up my training to see if I could break the plateau, but nothing seems to work. I've tried: 

1. decreasing the weight and increasing reps in order to increase total weekly volume 
2. introducing a wave loading kind of program with a light week, a moderate week, a light week, followed by a heavy week. 
3. using weighted negatives and weighted 90º lock-offs
4. introducing other exercises, such as shoulder external rotations, Arnold presses, hammer curls

Currently, I have two training days a week, each with 5 sets of 3 reps weighted pull ups (about 20-25 lbs), followed by 2 sets of hammer curls to failure, and two sets of horizontal rows to failure. I am not seeing any progress in my pull ups. 

Also, I'm pretty sure my strength in general is wildly out of balance, but I don't really know what the problem is. Because I have no clue what the problem is, here's a list of all my observations and stats for other exercises (which may hint towards strengths and weaknesses): 

OBSERVATIONS: 

1. I can't do a single hollow body pull up (like I can't even go half way up). I have always done pull ups with an arch in my back, and can't seem to pull at all when my feet are in front of me.
2. when I do a set to failure, my arms are always fatigued first, and are ultimately what causes the failure. I am pretty sure it's the brachialis / brachioradialis (which is why I have been implementing hammer curls) 
3. scapular pulls never felt quite right. it feels as if my external rotators or shoulders are kind of just moving, and my scaps aren't really doing anything. It's just an odd experience, and somehow my forearms always feel sore first when I do them. I hypothesize that it's because I have strong shoulders or something, which compensates for incredibly poor scaps?
4. I can't do a chest to bar pull up (it's genuinely not even close) 
5. at the top of my pull up, I find it very difficult not to shrug my shoulder. Although my pull ups are always initiated with some part of the back, I can't keep my shoulders from shrugging at the top (I hypothesize this is why my arms become sore
6. for those with knowledge of women's sports and stuff, I achieved my 1RM during the period of time I didn't have my period. Not sure if it's important, but I was under-fueling when I started training pull ups. I have a period now, but it's become quite irregular the past 9-ish months. Lmk if this part is interesting, I can expand on it. 

OTHER STATS: 

1. Dead-hang: 1.5-2 minutes 
2. Hammer curl: 25 lbs (11 kg) for about 6 reps (failure) 
3. Horizontal row: 40 lbs (18 kg) for about 15 reps (failure) 
4. Shoulder external rotation: 6-8 reps of shoulder(full ROM) with 25 lbs (11 kg) (this is with my elbow on my knee)
5. Push ups: I can do about 20 reps of push ups (failure) when my elbows are flared a bit more than 45º. If my elbows are parallel to my torso, and I use a shoulder-width grip, I can only do about 3 reps (my back is also arched when this happens, so my form is probably breaking)
6. not sure if relevant, but my finger strength is pretty good. from a 20 mm edge, my 1RM is 60 kg per hand. 

Anyway this was super long-winded, but if anyone had any ideas of what my problems are (even if they aren't related to my weighted pull up plateau), and any tips / programming that I can use to break out of the plateau, I would be really thankful. Thanks :D (also don't say protein; I eat >150 g/day easily)",1763847750.0,20,16,bodyweightfitness,fitness

I noticed that there were 2 things that happened to me:

1. My pull up plateau today. I can do around 20 clean, and start working on my Tucked FL Pull up, archer pull up and high pulls to progress into single arm pull up, but today was the first session I didnt progress at all. I slept good, reached my macros and wasn't sore (even took a day off yesreday). How u deal w plateu in pull ups ?

2. My chest grew way more then delts and arms. I thought working on my handstand, decline push ups, triceps dips and doamind push ups will do the work w triceps and delts, but I now think that I'm wrong. any advice and what had worked for u ?

So i’ve taken a break and just replaced pull ups and rows with scap pulls and scap rows and ive been fine. 

I feel my lats more than my shoulders in scap pulls but not so much scap rows. If I attach a band to the ceiling and do banded scap pulls(no body weight, just band) i really feel it in my lats. 

Are lats involved in scap pulls or not?It seems like they would be if you were doing active hangs but not scap pulls. 

Also is an active hang just the end range of a scapular pull up?

When i think active hang i think of more arch and more lats and scap pull is more up and down and not so much pinching shoulder blades and raising chest. ",1763831758.0,5,2,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1p395go,Resources I've found useful during my fitness journey,"So I used to go to the gym and lift weights consistently until a shoulder injury forced me to stop working out for 6+ months. To help ease back into regular exercise, I started doing yoga, stretches, and other light work to build strength and flexibility, with the ultimate goal of returning to the gym.

What happened instead was, I fell in love with bodyweight fitness. Not driving to the gym, dealing with lockers and sweaty weights feels great, and doing stuff like handstands or kip ups are just plain fun. I love the confidence and flexibility that comes with bodyweight workouts cause you can literally roll off the couch and just start doing stuff.

Certain exercises gave me a ton of trouble though - things like handstands, and planches that required way more core strength and balance always felt impossible. Planches are still crazy difficult for me.

But over the past few months I've made crazy progress (6 second handstand hold yesterday!) and wanted to share some stuff that helped me along the way. I've had these saved for awhile, and I figured they might be useful for some folks here that are just starting out.

These videos I felt had the best tips that really improved my form, and gave me a clear understanding of how to progress. Here's hoping I can do handstand pushups by next summer! Haha.

1p38z2k,How sleep affects weight loss (Research Review),"**Summary:** Poor sleep may make you gain fat and lose muscle mass. If you are on a diet, you may lose fat slower.

**Sleep deprivation slows fat loss and burns muscle instead**

Two studies have looked at the effects of sleep restriction in an energy deficit on body composition (fat mass and fat-free mass) in adults \[[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951287/); [23](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/41/5/zsy027/4846324)\]. In these studies, all participants lost body weight. However, the sleep deprived participants lost more fat-free mass (i.e muscle and water).

>

**Sleep longer for faster fat loss**

The current evidence suggests that increasing sleep duration and quality is beneficial for losing body fat. This might be because you are less likely to overeat, the longer you sleep \[[43](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22854682/)\].  
Three studies have found that sleeping longer is associated with reduced fat mass ([54](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32141273/), [43](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22854682/), [41](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31983513/#:~:text=No%20differences%20in%20cortisol%20or,treatment%20of%20obesity%20in%20adolescents.)) (...)

**Energy balance**  
Overall, sleep restriction makes you more passive, thus expending less energy (...) Some researchers have concluded that energy expenditure is not the primary component linking sleep deprivation to excess body fat, and is rather influenced by increased hunger and calorie intake \[[29](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23102177/); [31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3018785/)\].

1p2xrcj,"6 year ""progress"", thoughts and advice welcome.","But please understand I'm trying the best I can, if I were just half assing, I would've given up a long time ago considering how much time and effort this requires.

I started the RR maybe 5 years ago (and general fitness things maybe a year or two before that), the picture on the left is from 2019, the picture on the right is from last week.

I really don't know what more could I have been doing wrong, over the years, whenever it dawned on me that it's not working (which obviously happened frequently), I'd try and fix things and improve upon what I'm doing, but for 6 years to go by without **any** change I really don't know what I could be doing so wrong that makes it impossible for my body chemistry to change. Even if I was doing the worst of forms before, I'd assume over time the workload would make me just a bit stronger and have something to show for it.

I'm now eating more, sleeping more than I have ever before and I still feel zero strength increase (if I increase the amount of weight I carry while exercising, I just end up being able to do fewer reps and the number never goes back up nor does it ever feel any easier), and obviously no physical change. I get heavier whenever I try to eat more but the reps never gets easier or increase in amount, so I doubt any of that weight came from muscle increase.

I do the RR three times a week and I used to be against the idea of adding weight (via a backpack or something) while exercising because by definition that's no longer ""bodyweight"" and I wanted a minimal equipment set up so I could do it anywhere, but I've since started using a weighted backpack, which has only dropped my rep counts (but never brought back up). I also really push as hard as I can during the sessions, I stop a set when I can only do half a rep (but I've also tried leaving failure until the final set). Unless that's still not working hard enough.

I'm male, 171cm, age 24, weigh 67kg, and atm eating 3250kcal with 180g protein, and I just want to be adequately athletic and not look like I've never exercised. I am having a hard time eating that much as is and I just can't imagine my current physique requires that much food just to maintain, especially when I ate far less years ago and looked pretty much identical, could probably do about just as much. I also work from home on a computer so I'm not spending much extra energy.

Never having experienced any gains in strength on one hand despite the consistency and effort makes me really respect people who are strong, on the other hand I feel like it's just not in the cards for me considering any amount of consistent physical exercise should at least make you somewhat stronger.

Apologies for the rant/vent, I really hope I could at least achieve an average physique but to have that feel like an impossible goal is really defeating.

My body weight is 230 pounds, and I use +45 lbs for pull ups and +85 lbs for dips. I do 7 sets a workout and go to failure on each set for each exercise. Lately it has become more difficult to keep good form and higher rep range for each exercise because the weight is taxing on the body as I superset pull ups with dips in the same workout.  And I noticed that even with taking 48 hours between sessions it feels like not enough rest and my performance seems to be inconsistent.

When I experimented with doing just a dips workout and just a pull up’s workout I have noticed that I do more reps per set but don’t get the same “pump” or “fatigue” after a workout and feel like my intensity is not the same. Now I’ve been contemplating on splitting the two movements and doing them on separate days with rest day in between, to allow the body and nervous system to recover. 

Do you guys think this is a good idea or should I keep supersetting and just rest more in between the workout sessions ? Do you have any experience/ ran into a similar problem and what was your solution ? 

Any and all advice is welcomed. ",1763613480.0,3,14,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1p1r62i,"24M desk job – a comment told me to try more bodyweight, does this plan look okay? (feel free to roast me)","hey all,

24M here with a full-time desk job.

i’ve dropped about 18 lbs over the last few months mostly with:

* a small calorie deficit
* walking more
* 3x/week basic lifting at the gym

in one of my other posts, someone commented that i should try more bodyweight-focused work instead of relying so much on machines/barbells, especially since my goal is to be generally strong/fit and not just “okay at the big 3.”

so i read through the FAQ + Recommended Routine and tried to put together something i can stick to for the next 4–6 months. would love thoughts/roasts.

# stats / goals

* age: 24
* sex: male
* job: desk all day
* current weight: \~210 lbs
* height: \[5’11”\]

goals:

* keep losing a bit more fat slowly
* build decent strength with bodyweight basics
* not feel like a potato sitting all day

**tentative routine (3x/week full body)**

3 non-consecutive days (e.g., Mon/Wed/Fri):

1. squat pattern
   * assisted shrimp squats / bodyweight squats (working toward shrimp/pistol progressions)
2. horizontal push
   * incline push-ups → regular push-ups (working toward diamond/decline as i get stronger)
3. horizontal pull
   * inverted rows under a table/rings (feet closer → further as progression)
4. vertical pull
   * band-assisted pull-ups / negative pull-ups
   * goal: full pull-ups for solid reps
5. core
   * dead bugs / hollow body holds / plank variations
6. optional accessories
   * calf raises, face pulls/band work, etc., if i have energy

sets/reps:

aiming for 3 sets per movement, in the 5–8 “good reps” range (if 3x8 is easy, i’ll move to a harder progression / more leverage, etc.).

**other stuff i’m doing**

* walking 7–9k steps most days (before/after work, during calls)
* small calorie deficit, nothing extreme
* protein with most meals (eggs, chicken, greek yogurt, etc.)

# tracking progress

* daily weigh-ins → focusing on weekly averages
* weekly progress pics (same lighting/angle)
* i’ve also been using an ai app (Bodify) to track my body changes and set a realistic “goal body + timeline,” but for this post i mostly care if the routine itself makes sense for bodyweight strength

# what i’d love feedback on

1. does this look like a reasonable bodyweight-focused plan for a beginner/intermediate?
2. should i be prioritizing different progressions for my goals?
3. is 3x/week enough if i’m consistent, or should i add a lighter “easy day” with skill work?

appreciate any advice – trying to commit to something simple and sustainable instead of constantly changing programs. roast away 🙏",1763604926.0,2,4,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1p1obqt,How’s my muscle-up form?,"I got my first MU this past June, and am up to always 5 in my first set, ~4 in my second, and maybe 2 in set three on a good day. I finally got a video of it. I’m pretty proud of myself learning this after 40 but I can tell it’s not really clean. 

What should I focus on? My current goal is to stay at 5 in my first set even if I can do more so that I can work on getting sets two and maybe three up to 5 before planning how to go from there. 

I usually do MU work twice a week. I found only one day rest wasn’t enough, so give myself two days between sessions.

1p1de86,How to More Effectively Build Pull Ups,"Pull ups are sweet.

They’re immensely satisfying (as well as intense and potentially demoralizing), and a core workout for building upper body strength.

I’m always seeing people post on here asking for someone else to check their form or how to do more pull ups, so I thought I’d put this out there so we can take autonomy over our own forms.

Pull ups work best when we take the time to learn the muscles involved. For me, this doesn’t mean learning muscle names and locations; rather, it’s about developing a better understanding of the muscles involved. For those of you who remember Les Stroud from Survivorman, he offers great advice that‘s applicable here: learn traits and characteristics rather than plant names so that you can more effectively utilize them when in need (anyone remember the episode? I think it was the Alaska or Northern Canada one, but I’m not sure).

Anyway, back to business: We can learn the muscles involved by diversifying how we do our bar work. Spend time hanging on the bars, and you’ll get a better sense of the end range of motion and improve your grip. Build in scapula raises, and learn to shift from one side to another. Pull up with a bias toward one side, and try moving your legs around. Hang and pull into a leg sit, and try pulling with legs in front of you, behind you, and pulled to one side or another. Feel what’s pulling when you pull up.

Secondly, diversify how you’re pulling up. Spend some time trying to pull your chest through the bar and body check the bar into next week. Later, mix in slow, controlled movements that make you feel each muscle fiber as it activates and earn each millimeter of movement. We aren’t always going for the max number of reps, and different pulls provide different bits of learning.

Most importantly, mix reps into the day to build your knowledge, but learn to take breaks. Our bodies like to do to learn, but they also need time off to build and recover. Pay attention to how you feel, and build when you discover new ways your body is working toward the pull.

Much as we find ourselves frustrated with the limited translatableness of select weightlifting workouts to everyday strength, we must recognize that we aren’t always pulling the same way. Our bodies offer unique bundles of tools that can help us accomplish a wide array of tasks, and time spent learning what’s there will make us better at our end goal of doing more pull ups than any of our friends (let’s be real, that’s a big reason why we’re here). The best part is, each pull up will be a good one, and you’ll be able to understand why.

I wish you luck! Let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.

1p1cae9,Recommendations for pull ups,"Hi,

I hope you don't mind my asking but I wanted some input from this community.

I am attempting to learn to do pull ups, I can do about 3 or so but want to work up to doing 10 reps.

To assist me with my training, I'm considering buying some weight lifting hooks, primarily for when I use the pull up bar at my house.

The main reason for this is that I think a part of my problem is my grip strength, but I am doing climbing outside of this to improve my grip strength.

1p1aocw,Looking for Feedback on Routine – Front Lever & HSPU Focus,"Hey everyone, I’m looking for some constructive feedback on my new calisthenics routine. 75kg 175cm 23M, not interested in bulking muscle just in gaining strength. My main goals are skill-oriented, though I appreciate rep/strength work required to maintain strength and ultimately achieve some of the skills mentioned. The skills I would like to learn are handstand push ups (freestanding) and front lever, with secondary/more long term goals of a one arm pull up and planche. To sum up where I'm currently at, I can do around 18 clean form pull ups, 47.5kg 1RM pull up, adv tuck FL for around 15 seconds, 60kg 1RM dip, can easily hold a back lever, and can hold a handstand on paralettes for around 17s when I catch it, which is about 40% of the time.

I’d really appreciate it if you could take a look and give me honest feedback. I structure my workouts as straight arm/bent arm.

(Routine below — feel free to critique everything from exercise choice to set/rep schemes.)

**Bent Arm Day (push exercises all on parallettes):**

Around 5-10 min general warm up: Arm swings, Scapula pushes/pulls, some band work like pullaparts or face pulls and wrist work

4 x 5 Weighted pulls, currently at +28.75kg

4 x 8 Elevated pike push ups (or 4 x 5 wall-assisted HSPUs on alternating bent arm days)

4 x 5 Adv. tuck FL pull ups

4 x 5 Pseudo push ups (or 4 x 5 weighted dips at around +52.5kg on alternating bent arm days)

4 x 5 on each arm one arm scapula pulls

1 or 2 x crow pose holds and pull up isometrics if I have more gas in the tank

Cool down stretches

**Straight arm day (still only using parallettes for push):**

Same warmup as bent arm day

4 x 15s Chest to wall handstand holds

4-5 x 15sFreestanding handstand attempts

4 x \~12s Adv tuck FL holds focusing on form

4 x 15s Elevated bridge attempts (doing this as a way to open my shoulders to improve my handstand form)

4 x 3 FL negatives, 3s down at adv. tuck

4 x 15s L sit holds (Alternating between push and pull L sit holds on alternating straight arm days)

Cool down stretches

I usually do this around 3-4 times a week, obviously alternating between bent/straight arm. My main question is related to how you guys think this routine will benefit my FL and HSPU progress. Is there anything missing? Secondary Q about parallettes/no paralletes for HS, I use them as it's easier on the wrists, not sure if I should be training without them as well.

I know that this is a long post and so appreciate any and all replies. Thanks in advance!",1763566153.0,3,4,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1p17ikb,What warmups should I do before upper body exercises like push ups and pull ups?,"Exactly as the title stated. 

I am having difficulty finding good warmups to do before upper body exercises like push ups and pull ups. And because of that, I ended up doing like 16 warmup stretches before my upper body exercises which I find very demotivating as it would always take at least 10 minutes for me to finish my warmup stretches before I can get to the good part. Also, 16 warmup stretches because I’m the type of person who wants to include every single thing possible. Please don’t judge.

While I do understand the importance of warmup like stretches as they can prevent potential injures during my actual workouts, I also feel far less motivated to begin my workouts because of how absolutely dreading it is to go into 10 minutes worth of detail about physically warming up.

Are there any good recommendations that work wonders even if only for a small amount of repetitions? I am in dire need of a better and more efficient warmup routine so that I can be motivated once again. Please help.

1p14jc4,back-to-wall HSPU or chest-to-wall HSPU?,"I’ve been wondering which variation people here think leads to better long term progress. Personally, I stick to back to wall HSPU because it lets me push to actual failure safely. When I’m trying to go all the way to my limit, it’s much easier to bail out of the position without feeling like I’m about to fall forward or lose control. With chest to wall, I always feel like I have to stop early just to avoid an awkward fall, even though the body line feels stricter.

So I’m curious how others see it: does the stricter form of chest to wall make it worth the extra difficulty, or is back to wall better for consistent strength gains since you can actually grind out reps and push to failure without worrying about the exit?

Anyone who has trained both variations for a while I’d really like to know which one had the biggest impact on your HSPU strength and balance.",1763549760.0,1,4,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1p11u1c,Weighted vest. Rucking.,"So, ill try and be brief, im usually not.
I need a ""cheaper"" way to exercise. Paying a bit for a vest and some cheap dumbells or whatever is better then where I live. Gyms are expensive and far between, hiking is seasonal, and i NEED to move around. Working out and simply walking/hiking is part of my recovery. Yay. 

I have rucked before, I have done the pack test for firefighters, 3 miles in 45 minutes with other rules.  For one firefighting season it kinda got to me and I ended up liking it. 

Im here hoping my rambling and other ""issues"" will translate correctly for everyone here to understand what im looking for. 

The specifications, what im looking for...

I currently have some posture problems and neck issues. So the main NEED would be a comfortable one. Something that would fit as if its part of me or even maybe help ""correct"" my posture. (I know thats laughable, but some things can be so simple sometimes and someone here might have some amazing insight. Lol)  and it doesnt rest too much on said neck. 

Coming straight from that would be able to add or remove weights. So like a 12-60 as an example. 
I will use it for walking, jogging, weight training and hiking. This is simple, I want to be able to move the weights and i dont want to be limited by not enough weight.

Small menial things like pockets are give or take, idc. Ill still have pants on, I got pockets. Maybe the reflective bit because people drive into people sometimes. 

Price... what I meant by cheaper. I found a vest for $180 but I have no idea if that would work. (Im going to try some next week to get an idea.) But id rather spend that 180 then spend years paying for a membership. But i wouldnt mind spending a third of that because I posted here. I can always spend a menial amount and just get a cheap one, but my luck, that cheap one would be my necks pains doom.

I dont know my weight right now, but i fluctuate quite a bit. Probably around 170 right now at 5'10"". I dont have really wide shoulders, but im thick front to back. I have big traps and rhomboids. Idk if this is an issue with rucking vest fitting? But it does effect my shirt sizes.. so.. idk. Figures these vests are highly adjustable, but, checking boxes here.

Honestly, I feel like there's more, sorry its so long.

1p0wczc,Modifications for ninja warrior-style workout class?,"I tired searching this sub but everything is at least 6 years old. I've always preferred bodyweight workouts because they're easier to do at home, and my children have been attending ninja warrior classes for a while. The gym recently added an adult ""ninja fit"" class that you can take while your children are in class, and I was excited because I need the accountability of a class. However, while they advertised it as being a fitness class for beginners, half the stations had advanced ninja elements. 

  
The coach was encouraging and supported any time I said I would modify, but seems inexperienced in working with beginners, and especially with adults. I think this is more due to his experience than willingness to help (he's been doing ninja most of his life). There's also a huge gap in ability - 3 adults in their 40s and 4 teenagers who love ninja and go regularly. Any tips on how I can modify some of these exercises?

\-Trapeze swing: Stand on 1ft box, jump about 2ft to catch metal bar in front of you, using your momentum land on box about 2-3ft away

\-Lachey bar swing: Using your swinging momentum, start from one bar and then jump to catch another bar. (Think monkey bars but both hands at a time instead of one) I tried to modify with pull ups but he suggested I just swing, and it hurt my hands

\-PVC pipe spinning balance beam: Take 4 steps on a pvc pipe that is set on top of wheels so it's spinning (think log roll on water) 

  
There were other stations that were fine - box jumps, crunches, planks, etc - but these examples were pretty extreme and as I reflected more and more I'm surprised I didn't hurt myself. I'm planning on continuing the class since it's the most convenient time, but would appreciate any modifications or alternate exercises I could do in a short rotation style workout.",1763521582.0,8,3,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1p0oivv,"Had a bad first experience with the gym, now trying to get back into it but kinda stuck.","Hey, so a while ago I started going to the gym as a rather skinny but athletic person. I found a training routine online that I liked and that fit my description pretty well, and I started going consistently 3 days a week for about a year. I had always heard that as a beginner you see gains pretty quickly, so I was pretty stoked about that.  
Thing is, after a whole year of going 3 days a week, I didn’t see any big noticeable growth. I’m still skinny and have just gotten a little more athletic, which wasn’t really the point since I wanted to put on muscle. I sort of quit for a few months, but now I realized I probably didn’t see noticeable improvement due to two key factors:  
First, I didn’t change my diet at all, and second, I didn’t lift with enough intensity and never really hit failure.

So now I want to get back into the gym, but I can’t tell if my current routine is good or not. It really is something I take seriously, because with my rather skinny build and a tough time putting on weight, having a bad routine could just make me waste another whole year — after which I’m not sure I’ll still want to return.

This is the routine I currently follow, based on a recommended workout I found on Reddit with a few adjustments of my own. I do it every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday.

First Pair

3×6 weighted pull-ups — after each set I rest for 1 minute 30 seconds

3×8 squats — 1 minute rest


Second Pair

3×8 Australian pull-ups — 1 minute rest

3×15 weighted push-ups with about 8 kg — 1 minute rest

3×8 pike push-ups — 1 minute rest


Abs

3×8 hanging leg raises — 45 seconds rest

3×8 V-ups — 45 seconds rest

3×1-minute plank

3×30-second side planks


Right now, I’m mainly looking for better weighted push variations. I put weight in my bag and do push-ups, but they feel too easy and I don’t feel like I’m getting the maximum benefit. I’m trying to find progressions or extra exercises that will keep me improving and getting stronger.

I feel a bit limited with my equipment. All I have is a pull-up bar, some school weights, a few ankle weights I put in my bag, and two 3 kg dumbbells. I’m willing to invest around £40 in extra equipment, but my bedroom isn’t very big. I’m 15 years old and weigh about 53 kg. I’d say I’m fairly muscular — I have visible abs and can do a one-arm push-up — but I feel like I’m reaching a point where I’ll only be maintaining instead of progressing. I’m also quite short and trying to reach around 55–60 kg.

1p0fhub,Calluses hurting more than my muscles during pull-ups. Any advice?,"
I recently started doing EMOM pull-ups (3 reps every minute). I do this once every two days. My pulling strength is fine, but the calluses on my palms have suddenly become the limiting factor. In the next session they hurt so much that I have to stop even though my back and arms still have energy.

I’m using a 1.25-inch iron bar. The skin on my palm bunches up and forms hard calluses that feel like they’re getting pinched during the pull. Because of this I can’t focus on form or progression.

How do you manage calluses while still training regularly? Do I need to change my grip, bar thickness, or frequency? Any tricks to stop them from hurting so much?

Would appreciate any tips from people who do pull-ups or calisthenics regularly.

I work from home and the barrier of having to leave the house, drive somewhere and deal with crowded gym was just too much most days. I built a simple home setup instead and I've been way more consistent, what I use now:

Resistance bands (got a set for like $25), use these for upper body stuff, rows, chest press, shoulder work, way more versatile than I expected

Yoga mat, obviously, for floor work and stretching, nothing fancy just something to cushion my knees

Doorway pull up bar ($30), took me 3 months to do even one pull up but it's progress

Adjustable dumbbells, this was my biggest investment around $200 but saves so much space compared to a full rack

Fitness app called Ray for programs, needed something that would build workouts with what I have and adjust in real time, this one has that option

Phone stand so I can follow along without holding my phone

That's literally it, total investment was maybe $300 and I use it 4-5 times a week now compared to the gym I never went to. The key for me was removing every excuse and now I’m getting actual results and it’s amazing.

push ups

squats

pull ups

dips

rows

and I do 3 sets of 8 for all of those.

then I do

hand stand

parallel bar support

hang

all for 1 minute each.

and then I do antranik 5 body line drills. which is basically a plank, side plank on each side, reverse plank, then hollow hold, and then the superman hold, all for 1 minute each.

and I do that thing where you stand and roll your arms forward and back too.

I like leg exercises too I want to do those too, just its winter so no one sees, and I figure I can get a lot of leg stuff done through bicycling.

so im just asking what can I do to take it to the next level. exercise also makes me feel good so its a healthy way to pass the time.

instead of doing different body sections on different days, I just want to do a full body work out once every 3 days (so one day on, two days off, one day on, two days off). and I think ill aim to do at least 1 hour of cardio every day? not sure. im trying to figure out what I should do the other 2 days. maybe more cardio?

In the beginning I was able to do about 2 reps per arm. On a good day now I can do 5-7 reps per arm per set on both legs and 3-4 reps per arm per set with one leg. I do controlled reps with a small half second hold at the bottom to cancel out momentum and add an extra challenge. 

Usually I do about 2-3 sets on both legs and 2 sets on one leg. I should mention I took a small injury break for a couple weeks but that’s not really long enough to see a decline in strength.  
I’ve been doing them on knuckles as well  (hands a few inches more than shoulder width apart) and am able to do 5 reps per arm on a good day, which has also pretty much plateaued now.

The problem is I’ve been stuck at these reps for the last 3-4 months and feel unable to do more reps per set (arms pretty much give out at the 7th rep at most)

1oz2znh,Anyone have success building muscle while eating less than 1g of protein per 1lb of body weight?,"Lately I’ve been rethinking something that’s been considered dogma in the fitness world for years: the idea that you must eat at least 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight to build or maintain muscle.

For as long as I’ve been training, that guideline has followed me everywhere — in articles, podcasts, conversations at the gym, and even in personal advice from trainers and fitness-focused friends. And sure, it’s become a simple rule of thumb that’s easy to follow and easy to remember. But I’m starting to wonder if it’s actually necessary for everyone, all the time, in every phase of training.

Here’s why I’m asking.

I’ve been tracking my own training, nutrition, hydration, recovery, and body composition pretty meticulously. I strength train consistently, I stay active, and I pay attention to the signals my body gives me. Over the past few months, I’ve also learned a ton about how hydration, sodium balance, and overall recovery play huge roles in muscle retention — sometimes even bigger roles than we give them credit for.

Recently, I’ve started looking at my protein intake through a different lens. Not because I want to cut protein drastically, but because I want to understand the real relationship between protein intake and actual muscle growth or maintenance. The classic 1g per pound rule puts me in the 210–220 grams per day range. That’s a lot of food, a lot of digestion, and honestly a lot of metabolic burden — especially on days when I’m not hungry or when my hydration balance is already being challenged by training volume, creatine, sodium, or just life.

The question that’s been on my mind is this:

Has anyone here successfully built or maintained muscle while eating less than 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight?

I’m not talking about eating low protein. I’m talking about something like 0.6–0.8g per pound while still training with intention, progressively overloading, and recovering well. Did you notice any difference? Did your performance, strength, or body composition change? Did you feel better, worse, or the same? And did factors like hydration, sleep, or total calories play a bigger role than expected?

Some people say the 1g/lb rule is more of an “insurance policy” than a requirement. Others swear it’s non-negotiable. And then there are people who claim they grew just fine on much lower numbers as long as calories were adequate and training was solid.

I’m genuinely curious to hear real-world experiences — not theories, not recycled advice, not internet myths. If you’ve actually lived through a phase where you intentionally or unintentionally ate less protein but still made progress, I’d love to hear your story.

1oy1oba,Toxic Mindset & Misinformation in the Calisthenics Community,"I’ve noticed a growing trend in the calisthenics community, especially on social media, that I think is worth discussing. It’s not just ego or people “selling” fast-track programs, it’s the amount of misleading advice and oversimplified takes being pushed around.

We’re seeing more athletes than ever achieving impressive skills, which is great for the sport. But alongside that, there’s also been a rise in messages like: “Pike push-ups are useless,” “You don’t need progressions or strength building for planche,” “I achieved planche in a month,” so on, and so forth. And the first question I always think is: “Starting from what baseline?” Because whether it’s beginners, people coming back from inactivity, or anyone without foundational strength are not realistically achieving advanced skills that quickly. 

What worries me is that many of these claims are used to promote programs or approaches that aren’t realistic for most people, and this obviously can lead to frustration or even serious injury. Some creators also downplay the importance of rest, warming up, or proper technique, thus creating a mindset where pushing through everything is seen as normal. That can be harmful for new athletes who don’t know any better. Another big issue behind all of this, is that a lot of advice online seems to come from personal experience only, without understanding basic biology, biomechanics, or progressive training principles. Experience does matter, but it can’t or won’t ever replace actual evidence-based training knowledge. 

I think this creates a cycle where people follow whatever a high-level athlete says, even if the information is incomplete or not suitable for them. In the long run, that ends up hurting the community more than it helps. At the end of the day, different tools work for different people. What doesn’t help one athlete might be exactly what another person needs. I just wish there was more nuance, more honesty about starting points, and a bigger focus on safe, sustainable training.

I've been on the Recommended Routine for a few months now and I'm having trouble adjusting my core exercises. I'm at the end of the progressions and find every exercise too easy. For context, I workout at home and my equipment for is mainly a set of rings.

Anti-Extension:
I'm at the last exercise: ring ab rollout. I can do a good 3x20 reps with a break of a few seconds after eccentric , its a bit harder when I'm on my knees but hardly. I tried raising my feet on blocks, but it doesn't change much. I hardly feel it in my abs afterwards, its more in the arms with the pronounced angle.

Anti-Rotation:
Last exercise: Ring pallof Press. I'm at a good 30 degree angle with my legs close by, a second break after eccentric and my abs contracted. Easily 3x12

Extension:
Arch Body Rocks, last exercise. Easily 3x12

Do you have any suggestions on other exercises I can do for my core training to replace these? Or ways to make them significantly harder? Thank you!",1763235974.0,0,5,bodyweightfitness,fitness

I've recently started incorporating more bodyweight exercises into my routine. Initially, I could only do 4-5 pull ups so decided to try a 30 day challenge, and I'm up to 8-9 now. However, I've noticed over the 30 days that my left forearm seems to activate far more than my right.

1oxkdaj,Push pull balance issues and strategies,"This is an open discussion rather than a specific question. 

One of the advantages of BWF is that you can do it with minimal equipment. But if you look closer, almost all of the pulling exercises require equipment, while the main pushing exercises can be done in pure bodyweight fashion.

Pushup, pike press, squat cover the push days. Progression? Archers, wall supported HSPU, shrimp/bulgarian split/pistol squats. Still no need for any equipment. 

However, pull ups and rows require at least sturdy bars, and a proper deadlift needs to be done with a lot of weight. Progression? You can always increase reps with pull ups, but you can't increase intensity without extra equipment. Inverted rows get easy pretty fast too. 

It's relatively easier to progress in push exercises, but I believe pull exercises are more important than push exercises. I do my best to balance push and pull volume, but I think I'll tip the scale towards pulling exercises and do more volume/intensity with them.

Am I overthinking? Any ideas?",1763187429.0,7,9,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1owhcro,"""Approaching 10 Years Of Daily Pushups"" - Today Was 9½ Years Of Pushups Every Day Without Miss :","**About My Current Steak Of Long Term Daily Pushups :**

November 13, 2025 - I write this a couple hours after a brief minisession where I supersetted pushups and hindu squats to start.

With that first set of pushups allowing me to make the checkmark for the day I had successfully made yet another six month completion interval of doing pushups every day without miss...

This current steak dates back to the last missed day which was May 13, 2016.

  
That one had run from around July 4, 2012 to then without miss.

And before that I had started daily pushups somewhere in summer 2008, running that with a handful of misses (about one every six months) and taking a six month break from it in those first four years before starting it back again.

  
In a sentence I've been doing daily pushups for a long time...

  
Now with six months to go to the successful completion of a decade without miss this is the longest active steak of daily pushups I've maintained...and it's actively counting.

  
I type with excitement. Years ago wanting to have the ability to say that I have done daily pushups for a decade without miss. It. Is. Close.

  
I type hoping this inspires. 

Pushups every day is a journey I started as a teenager and have kept as habit since - now in my thirties I am still going.

  
Sheer volume over years and years has given me a pretty good level of physical strength.

  
For example I have done weighted pushups with people standing on my upper back, though you need the context that I am not small - currently weighing 290lbs.

  
Somewhat often I am mistaken for a powerlifter as that's what how I type as far as appearance...I just have a long term, if often brief/minisession, daily calisthenics habit.

  
I've long term integrated a few minutes of calisthenics into my day to day.

  
.....

  
**About Other Related Things :**

  
Admittedly with my humorous leverages of a 5'7"" wingspan (comically short arms) at 6' in height I am blessed with absurdly good shoulder health, though I do believe pushups are generally pretty easy on the joints.

  
I don't much bother with perfectly balancing my push/pull stimulus, but generally consider it to even out well enough on it's own accord as I have always preferred to, and have trained full body.

  
I'm very outspoken on strength training preferably being done as full body sessions and more often than not as high frequency training.

  
That said I could use more pullup training in my life. I've been as high as x27 or x29 as my unweighted PR (I forget which) on those, but that was at 50lbs lighter a few years ago.

  
However I still maintain ""The Gentleman's x5 Rep Minimum"" on them.

  
Basically daily full body training can work. It can work very well. The human body is meant to adapt to stimulus.

  
It can be super simple ; some pushups, some squats or lunges, some rows or pullups, and move on with your day.

  
Humanity thrives on regular physicality. Calisthenics work like the above is where the process is truly excuse free.

  
You always have floor exercises. If I'm without equipment flexing can cover pull (as in push/pull/legs).

  
Back to the initial point of the daily pushups streak ; mostly lately it's pretty low volume, generally 30 or 50 total reps a day for a couple years now, but that's varied a lot and volume has been high to very high in the past.

For example at 20/21yo it was well over 1000 total pushup reps weekly.

This was a flow write, so any questions/stuff left out feel free to ask.

1oweupk,How to increase endurance.,"Hello,
Fellow hybrid bodyweight athlete/gymrat here. I want to increase my rep max on WEIGHTED pull ups and WEIGHTED dips. I spent some time doing a little higher reps than usual lately, got some progress, but I wanna push way further than that, and Im not sure how to structure my workouts. 
I'm a male, 24yo, 75ish kg. 
And I'm not talking about rookie numbers here (don't want it to sound egoistically ofc)
My maxes are:
DIPS:
1RM: 80kg
10 reps: 50kg
20reps: 25kg (could probly bang a bit more now)
17reps: 30kg
Bodyweight: never got past 40-45, cause I got bored haha

PULL UPS:
1RM: 55kg
10 reps: 25kg
15reps: 15kg (haven't tested in a while)
Bodyweight: 25-30 range, haven't tested in a while. 

The goal? That's the thing. On dips I'd like to get to 30 reps with 30kg, or 40 reps with 20kg. Pull ups I would like to get to 20 reps with 20kg.

How would you structure it? I would like to hear from someone who did something similar. Because doing sets with 2-3RIR as you would do if you wanna increase your max while your max reps is 10 doesn't make sense for me.

I used to think you *had* to lift heavy weights to build muscle.  
But calisthenics completely changed that for me.  
What worked for me:

* Progressive overload (adding reps, sets, or weight to bodyweight movements)
* Weighted pull-ups, dips, and handstand push-ups
* Training 4–5 days/week, eating enough protein, and sleeping well
* Patience — results came slowly, but they came

If you’re skinny and think calisthenics can’t build muscle — it absolutely can. You just have to treat it like real strength training.

I’m still far from where I want to be, but I’m proud of how far I’ve come.

My favorite workout is the dead hang, I have been able to get up to 1 minute and 45 seconds and I am trying to get up to 2-3 minutes, however everytime I reach the 2 minute mark my hands start hurting, almost like they are being pinched and stretched, I have no muscle fatigue or loss of grip I just always end up letting go because of the pain in my hands. I was wondering if anyone has any tips on how to make that pain go away, I typically grip the bar tightly usually around the top of my palm. I use a pull up bar that has a foam protection on it, I have been doing these for months and while I have seen progress in my muscles it seems like I always hit the wall with my hands being in a burning stinging pain during these deadhangs, so just wondering if maybe I am doing it wrong or if this just takes more time to be able to reach the goal I set.

1ouz22v,Why is it that some people are strong but don't 'look' strong,"I see it quite regularly that people are told all rep ranges build muscle and there are some damn good physiques of calisthenics people and yet there are some quite strong people who don't really have visible muscles. 

One of those people for example is the guy who has the hybrid calisthenics channel on youtube. He's obviously strong. I mean the guy does pull ups with ease while talking to the camera but if I didn't know, I wouldn't guess that he works out just by looking at his body.

So how does this work? 
My thinking is that to build muscle you need to give your muscles a reason to grow. In other words push them to their limit or close to and progressively overload so they grow. I get that, but what part I don't get is at some point these guys would have had to start as beginners so getting to a point where he can easily do pull ups or dips would have required the body to adapt to that stress and hence build muscle right? And if it's just getting stronger without getting bigger, doesn't that throw out the whole 'all rep ranges build muscle' thing? How would you get stronger without getting bigger? By big I obviously don't mean bodybuilder big. Just, you know, a bit more developed than the average guy. ",1762933348.0,1287,284,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1ouw8va,Tracking bodyweight progress is weird (strength vs aesthetics disconnect),"
8 months into calisthenics and I feel my performance has improved dramatically.

Started: 0 pullups, now doing 15 strict. L-sit: couldn't hold it, now 45 seconds. Dips: struggled with 5, now hitting 20 easy.

Objectively huge progress right?

But I look almost identical in photos. Maybe slightly more defined back but it's subtle.

This is messing with me because everyone says track your progress with photos but what if the photos show basically nothing while your performance explodes?

I think bodyweight training just doesn't build size the same way weights do. Or maybe I need to eat more, or my expectations are wrong.

Tracking methods I've tried:

- Progress photos (not helpful for me)
- Performance metrics like pullup reps and hold times (this actually works)
- Measurements (slight changes but nothing dramatic)
- Videos comparing form (can see technique improvement)

Using Boostcamp to log the performance stuff has helped mentally. I'm objectively way stronger even if I don't look that different.

1ourbzq,Routine check — 3×/week ring circuit (3×5 jackknives for pull volume),"Hey [r/](https://www.reddit.com/r/overcominggravity/)bodyweightfitness — looking for a routine sanity-check and some pointers.

**TL;DR:** training 3×/week, circuit-style on rings. I can only do 2 strict BW pull-ups right now, so for volume I’m doing 3 sets of 5 jackknife pull-ups paired with static ring isometric holds (the isometric is a regression for ring dips). Then I pair ring inverted rows with ring push-ups. Finish with step-ups trying to unlock pistols. Thoughts?

**Routine (current, 3×/week):**

* Three rounds of each:
   * **Hold/Pull pair:** 3 sets — jackknife pull-ups ×5 (for volume; I can do 2 strict BW pull-ups) back-to-back with a static ring isometric hold (a ring-dip regression)
   * **Push/row pair:** 3 sets — ring inverted row + ring push-up (back-to-back)
   * **Single-leg:** 3 sets — step-ups (working toward pistol squat)

**What I’m wondering / would appreciate feedback on:**

1. Is that structure/volume reasonable for 3×/week given my current pull strength (2 strict pull-ups)?
2. Regressions/progressions for pistols that worked for you — box pistols, band-assisted, ring-assisted, shrimp/split squat, Cossack, eccentrics, etc.?
3. Pull strength: am I wasting time doing 3×5 jackknives + isometrics as a pair given I can do 2 BW pull-ups? Better set/rep schemes or frequency for faster pull progress?",1762909397.0,3,2,bodyweightfitness,fitness

I understand why. I have a stressful lifestyle. I study medicine and I'm a volunteer EMS among other things, so I don't sleep or rest as ideally as I should and I keep a reduced routine. Sometimes I do full body, 2 leg exercises and 2 upper exercises, 3x5 for all of them. Sometimes I only do upper body because I'm exhausted, 4 exercises and 3x5 also. Many times I do none and can only work out once in a week.
When I get 6 reps in the last set I up the weight. This usually never happens, even though I go to failure.

I can do 5 pullups and like 8 chest to bar dips despite working out for a few years. Its weird. Sometimes I feel like it's a mental issue.

I am 24M 125pounds 5’6

So I started doing pushups daily 3-4 months ago, I didn’t count how many I’d do when I started but I’d always go to failure, after about a month I started keeping track of how many and I’d make myself do 100 (do about 50-60 then take a 20-30 second break and finish the rest), I’d do that 2-3 times a day I had no issues with that and felt like I was progressing good, eventually I moved up to 200 in the morning and then do the 100 1-2 more times throughout the day. I got some dumbbells so when I’d do the pushups I could workout my biceps while triceps and chest recovering instead of taking 20-30 second break, just to keep the momentum up and build some muscle in my biceps, since about 2-3 weeks ago I can’t even do 50 without back pains and need to stop so I don’t hurt myself. I can’t push myself to failure and I don’t get the tightness or burn, I’ve tried reading and making my form as best as possible to prevent this but no luck still, the pain is coming from between my shoulder blades and sometimes lower back. I’ve tried going low and slow, faster pushups, tried to change my form in lots of different ways to prevent back pains

I’ve tried to just do curls until failure without pushups because it doesn’t hurt my back (6 reps of 25 pounds) or 8-10 reps of 20 pounds, I do 2-3 sets. is it normal for the tightness to go away after a workout or should I do more sets? I push myself to failure and still don’t feel no tightness in muscles or feel like I’m progressing in any way

I’ve only taken 1-2 rest days throughout the last couple months because I like to keep the momentum is that a bad idea? Should I start focusing on my core muscles instead or just keep doing the pushups and ignore/hope back pain will go away? I want to stick with the pushups I don’t like going to the gym because I don’t like the environment.. does anyone have some suggestions on what other home workouts I can do? I only have dumbbells 

Clarifying my questions

Does tightness/burn in muscles go away from working out after awhile, even after complete failure? Or am I not doing enough sets anymore?

Should I focus on my core muscles instead of focusing on only pushups/curls? Or just ignore the back pain and keep doing the pushups hoping that it will go away eventually

Any other at home workout similar to pushups that will prevent back pains? I have adjustable dumbbells

Honestly any advice is appreciated at this point idek what to do and sometimes I just want to quit because I feel like im only hurting my back and not getting any stronger.. I haven’t had any injuries that would cause back pain and I don’t get out much other then to golf so I don’t think I have any injury’s that would cause this.. thanks for reading any response is appreciated

I usually go to an outdoor park with bars to train (the RR). The problem is that it's starting to get cold now, I get home from work at 8-9 pm, and the park is an hour away from my house, so I can only go on weekends. 
My intention was to get a pull-up bar and some rings so I could train at home during the week. I live in a small rental apartment, where I can't drill holes or hang anything from the ceiling. I weigh 75 kg and am 1.82 m tall.
My door frames look sturdy and are 7 cm wide (the door is 2 m x 70 cm). I'm afraid of damaging the frame with a bar, and I don't know if I could hang the rings to do rows or dips. Should I go for a separate pull-up bar that is sturdy enough to work with? Opt for a lower bar for L-sit pull-ups and look for another parallel bar? Stick with the door bar?

1) I have purposely halted myself to the Single Legged Deadlift and Bulgarian squat. While I can do 3x8 without getting even close to failure, during the last reps of the last sets I loose a bit of balance. So I decided to halt there until I can do 3x8 perfectly balanced. Is there any point to it?

2) in my last session I managed to do 3x8 Negative Pull ups but I find myself having trouble with breath control. What I do is a sharp inhale during the jump and upper position assumption. And exhaling as slowly as possible while getting down as slowly and stable as possible. I believe have a good form (watching myself on video) and all reps besides the last two (that are not that bat either way) come out good and slow. Yet I do find myself always short on breath. I do cardio once a week and last time I run 8.5km in about 55min so I don’t think I have a problem there. Is it normal to be short on breath during pull ups (I can’t even imagine doing 8 consecutive pull ups breathwise)? Any way I can work it? Do I stay on the negatives until I get more accustomed to it breathwise?

3) I can do 3x8 full push ups but barely one diamond. Do I keep grinding the diamond or stay on push ups?

Thank you in advance for your time.

1orvwqc,More frequency,"Hello everyone,
I'm thinking about switching from my full body routine which consists of horizontal/vertical pushing/pulling, quads, hamstrings and core (done 3 times a week with 12-18 weekly sets per muscle group) to a full body routine done 6 days a week, Kboges style but with a difference, I would do a strenght day (3-5 reps), hypertrophy focused  day (8-12) and endurance day (15-30 reps -- still within the hypertrophy range) and repeat. But still applying kboges template which is picking a push/pull/leg variation everyday.
I feel like it aligns more with calisthenics and I think I will enjoy more shorter daily workouts (weekly sets per muscle grojo are the same). The thing is I've been following my full body routine for 5 weeks and I think It would be stupid to switch since it's not recomended to switch consistently.

1orv1dk,HSPU and Front lever routine - keep as is or switch things up?,"Hi BWF,

  
I've been doing calisthenics for about 2,5 years now (lifting weights many years before that). For about a year or so my main goal has been getting a full front lever and a couple of clean handstand pushups. I've been making progress, if slowly (especially in the FL department I feel). I'm currently working out 4 days a week, doing a push pull split which looks like this:

Push:

\- 3 sets of either **elevated deficit pike pushups** or **freestanding HSPU negatives on parallettes, alternating each workout,** **5-7 reps**

\- 3 sets of **pseudo planche pushups on parallettes**, **5-7 reps**

\- 3 sets of **BW ring dips**, 8 reps

  
Pull: 

\- 3 sets of either **banded FL holds (10-12 seconds)** or **advanced tuck FL raises, 5 reps** (alternating each workout)

\- 3 sets of **tuck-advanced tuck FL row**s, **6 reps**

\- 3 sets of **weighted pull ups**, **5 reps**

  
At the end of each workout I try to do some pistol squats or box jumps for the lower body.

  
I'm M31, 175 cm tall and weigh about 80 kg (176 lbs).

  
Does this routine look good in relation to my goals? Is there something you would switch up? I'll add that I'm usually completely exhausted at the end of my workouts. Not sure if that's because of my poor conditioning or the intensity of the workouts (or both).

1orsr3n,Looking for suggestions and tips (daily calisthenics),"So my current routine (I do this 5 days a week, Monday - Friday) is the following: 

- 100 pull ups and chin ups with alternating grips 
- 100 dips 
- 250 - 300 pushups 

I’m doing circuit sets of 10 pull ups / 10 dips / 25-30 pushups, resting 2:30 between the first five sets, and taking 3:00 rest for the last five sets 

(All done in less than an hour, usually 45 minutes)

- Elliptical for 35 minutes 
- walking at least 3 miles per day

I want to incorporate ab work but my abs already hurt from all the dips and pushups. 

I guess I want to improve my general composition, looks, and capacity for calisthenics. I’ve been on this routine for a few months now and I don’t know how to progressively overload while still maintaining daily workouts. 

I can add weight to my pull ups and dips and stuff but that would render me useless for the next day. 

I switched from weightlifting and I look better now than I did then tbh.

1oros9z,"Trusted brand wall-mounted pull-up bar, but not in black? (UK)","TL;DR: are there any reputable brands that do wall-mounted pull up bars in silver/white?

Hello!

I'm trying to get better at pull ups (i.e. do any at all), and have been working on lower downs etc at the gym. I've a pull up mate in my room, but it's got a much fatter bar than at the gym so is hard to grip, and is low even for me (5'6"" ish) - so I can never straighten my legs. (And it wobbles, which isn't reassuring.)

We've got weird door frames in our house - oddly thick and really high. I've had a look at a bunch of the temporary bars that go on door frames, and none fill me with confidence/would fit our doors. (Especially if I'd need to jump to grab the bar. I'd want to be confident in the dynamic load-ability.)

The best bet for me (and my husband, who is ~100kg) looks like a wall-mounted pull up bar, but only the kitchen has a high enough ceiling for him to be able to not touch the ground AND do a proper pull up. 

The thing is ... a massive black wall mounted pull up bar would be really obvious and ugly in our kitchen. But if it were stainless steel/silver, or white, I think we could get away with it.

I've had a look online, and the Gornation one looks ideal, but for the colour. But all the other brands I've seen recommended here seem to be in black (or black and bright other colour) only. (I assume spray painting would wear off, but maybe I'm wrong.)

Every content creator is saying to work on scapula push-ups, they are kinda essentials, a fundamental. Why? I can scapula push up endlessly, or at least for the time I can hold the hand plank position or pseudo-planches etc. Is it really possible that some people are able to feel muscles working and fatigue from it? Is there a way to train the movement better with some progressive overload? Because bodyweight it's too much easy. Is there a way to really know if you are good at them, how can you test your strenght on a scapula push ups?

I don’t have any equipment since I live in a dorm with no gym, and I can’t really install anything because I have only one door that leads straight to the hallway. I'm trying to do all exercises with correct form but I'm finding that I can't do even some of the simplest variations of these exercises:

  
Table Rows - Can do 5 tops, with bent legs, but even after just 3 my form falls apart, so I try to do another 2 sets of scapular rows at least, but I feel like my form is not too great either, I don't really feel any burn afterwards but cannot do more either. Also, when I fully hang off the edge I basically lie on the ground, so I feel like I loose some range of motion at the bottom. Is there anything I can do to make it even easier, or another exercise that doesn't require installing equipment instead? 

  
Dips- I can do around 3 sets of 8 bench dips with decent form, but as soon as I try to progress to doing them with 2 chairs, I can't even do single negative dip, and 3 (straight) leg assisted at best. What should I be paying the most attention regarding form, with dips using chair? 

  
Pike Pushups- now here I have the most trouble, I cannot do a single one, I don't really know what an easier variation would be, I tried Incline one on my bed, but I feel like I cannot get the form right at all, I can barely do 3 of these and then faceplant immediately, what would be an even easier variation if not inclined, or a different exercise to build shoulder strength? 

I have been doing my routine for 2 weeks so far, and I would say I’ve already noticed improvements with all the other exercises I didn't name but none with there 3.

1oqo55o,Does core bracing create long term stiffness and hinder flexibility?,"Bracing the core or midsection is important part in calisthenic movements like pushups, rows, squats to protect the spine and create a stable body. Pullups can be done braced or with completely disengaged core for maximum back muscle activation.

Generally bracing is done to create a stiff plank like body throughout the movement. 

But, does bracing create stiffness in the long term? I may be completely long in my understanding here. Hence asking to clear my doubts.

If I want my body to be both muscular/strong and flexible, does bracing hinder that? Because after movements done with bracing, I feel much more stable throughout, but somewhat stiff, which does away gradually with rest days. 

Also when (in what positions or exercises) is bracing absolutely a necessity? And when can it not be so (e.g. in arched back pullups)? Say, during supermans or swimmers, is core bracing required or the spine can bear all the load of extension?",1762500748.0,2,7,bodyweightfitness,fitness

- Gym = Would be inconsistent, maybe 2-3x/week if I'm honest with myself
- Gym is 30min round trip and I know I'll skip days

I know consistency beats optimal programming, so home training is probably better for me right now. But wondering if I'm approaching a point where bodyweight progressions become really inefficient compared to just adding weight to a barbell.

1oqamus,How much benefit to alternating bulk/cut cycles vs fixed caloric intake,"I'm curious whether there's any established evidence of the magnitude of benefit of going through bulking and cutting phases versus not. Here's the thought experiment:

Imagine twins with identical body composition (say average fitness for a sedentary individual, 30% body fat, whatever). Both begin a 1-yr fitness plan with identical workouts and exert the same perceived effort in every set and rep. Both eat the same foods at every meal with a high-protein diet. 

Twin A begins the year-long program by cutting until they're at say 10% BF and then they bulk for a few months. They continue this cycle until the end of the year. At the end of the year, they adjust their energy balance and workout to just maintain their body composition.

The only difference with twin B is that they **start with** and spend the entire year with the exact same caloric intake and macros that twin A chose at the **end** of their year...and twin B maintains this eating plan for the entire year. Otherwise, everything else is identical between the two (workouts, sleep, etc.).

It seems to me that twin B must necessarily eventually reach the same ""equilibrium"" body composition that twin A achieved. But I'm curious whether it could happen roughly as quickly as twin A achieved their body comp (1 year)? Or could it potentially take dramatically longer? 

Or am I misunderstanding physiology and that twin B could not ever achieve the same body composition because they never operated for extended periods in a purposeful bulk or cut phase? So like for the next 10 years eating the exact same meals and performing the exact same workouts, could twin A still have a superior body composition 10 yrs later because they alternated bulking/cutting in that first year and twin B didn't?",1762462484.0,14,8,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1oq5suk,Are perfect push ups worth it?,"Perfect push up form not only feels really unnatural but it's so tedious that it makes me wonder if it is worth it. I don't know any basic body weight push ups that feels unnatural when done with "" correct "" form except for push ups. This makes me wonder if the perfect push up is even worth it. I know that good form is important for gains and long term health but is perfect form important? Is good form not good enough? No need for perfection. I think a 7/10 push up form is better than a 10/10 push up. I used to do really flared wide arm push ups but have improved my form well enough to make them narrow and less flared. This transition felt hard but not unnatural but the transition of +/- 70° arms to a very acute angle doesn't just feel hard but also really unnatural.

* Monday: hypertrophy (8-15 reps)
* Wednesday: higher reps (15+) for endurance
* Friday: strength (6-8 reps, weighted)

Do you think this kind of split is a good idea? Is it effective, or would you recommend doing it differently?  

Honestly, I want to provoke a real discussion here—what do you all think? Do you think this approach makes sense, or is there a better way to structure it? Would love to hear different opinions, experiences, and ideas on how to program calisthenics training for different goals.

1opqjf9,What I did to increase the reps of my dips,"The first method is to do one arm dip hold from the top position. You don't have to bend your arm but you don't have to lock your elbow neither. This will recruit a lot of muscles so when you do them, the number naturally increases. You can alternate between both arms every couple seconds if you do them on a table instead of the bars. I went from 40 something to 51 reps, it was pretty awesome. Second method is warm up with a couple reps first. You wanna get your joints and muscles all warm up so it's easier when you want to push your rep PR. Third method I use is forearm workout. I think a lot of the times our forearm strength is holding us back from doing more dips. So what I do is one arm high plank with your fists alternating between left and right. It looks like you are punching the ground but the main idea is to stabilize yourself with one fist. Also don't lock your arms but don't over bend it neither, same principle with the first method.

First, a bit of background about me. I’m 26 years old and have been lifting weights in the gym since I was 18, so around 8 years now. Lately, I’ve found a new way of training using only a kettlebell and my bodyweight. I no longer have the goal of becoming a bodybuilder; I just want to maintain my current muscle mass, get leaner, and become more athletic in general, improving my mobility, strength, and physical movement.

Right now, I’m trying to combine kettlebell workouts with calisthenics. However, I’m struggling to find a program that really fits me. Most programs online focus on doing lots of sets and reps of just one exercise, but I prefer doing more variety with fewer sets and reps.

I came up with a routine for myself, which I haven’t tried yet, and I’d love some feedback on it. For context, I have about 30–40 minutes a day to train, from Monday to Saturday, with Sunday as my rest day.



**Kettlebells & Calisthenics**  
*30s rest between sets*

**Push**

* KB Clean and Press — 3x5–8
* Dips — 3x10
* (Weighted) Push-ups — 3x10–15
* Hanging Knee Raises — 3x12

**Pull**

* KB Snatch — 5x10
* Pull-ups — 3x10–15
* KB Rows — 3x10–15
* Russian Twists — 3x15

**Legs**

* KB Deadlifts — 3x10–15
* Turkish Get-ups — 3–5 per side *or* KB Marches

1ooemq9,Training everyday,"Hey everyone, I’m looking for some advice and personal experiences from people who train every single day — or at least have experimented with daily training for a longer period

I know most people instantly want to jump in and say something like 'you need rest days' or 'you shouldn’t train the same muscles two days in a row.' If that’s your reaction, please just scroll past this post. I’ve heard that advice a thousand times, I understand the reasoning behind it, and it’s simply not what I’m asking for

I’m not trying to burn myself out or prove something macho. My main goal is to build an athletic body that can move well, stay strong, and last for decades — not just look good for summer. I’m more into long-term adaptation, tendon strength, joint resilience, and overall body efficiency. I’m fascinated by how the body can actually adapt to daily stress if the load, intensity, and intent are managed smartly

Right now I train every day, but I vary how I approach it — sometimes I go for EMOM-style tendon work, sometimes I do low-load full range mobility, and other days I push intensity more. The point isn’t to destroy my body every day, it’s to educate it to recover faster, handle load better, and build that durable strength you can rely on for life

So what I’m looking for here are stories and insights from people who also train daily — not just gym bros doing push/pull/legs six times a week, but people who’ve found sustainable systems to make daily movement and training work for them. How do you manage volume? How do you make sure you’re adapting instead of digging into fatigue? Do you use wave-style progressions or micro-load adjustments day to day?

I’m also interested in how people mix tendon and muscular work when training daily. For example, doing short EMOM tendon sessions multiple times a day versus one solid full-body session. Have any of you experimented with multiple short training bouts (like 5–10 minutes each) spread through the day — and noticed any difference in energy, pain tolerance, or growth?

And of course, I’d love to hear what mental side effects you’ve noticed. Personally, training every day keeps me grounded — it’s like a rhythm that keeps my brain and body in sync. But I’m curious if others have noticed sharper focus, calmer mood, or just a more balanced mindset from daily movement

Anyway, thanks in advance to everyone who’s willing to share real experience, not just theory or textbook advice. Again — if your only point is 'you need rest days,' this post isn’t for you. But if you’ve learned how to make daily training sustainable, adaptable, and meaningful, I’d really appreciate your insights

1onotw7,"Is it beneficial to get your heart rate up throughout the day? And is not doing so bad? (18m, 5'7, 125-130lbs)","So obviously a sedentary lifestyle is not good right? But is it that much better if you are active for small portion of the day, then not active for the rest? I've heart critiques of people who go to the gym for an hour or two but then just are sitting the rest of the day. I've also heard things like getting up and walking around every so often when sitting/laying down for a long time is good too, but idk if that's true

Sometimes I have a very active lifestyle where I am moving, exercising, and just being active for the majority of the day. Walking/jogging places, lifting and moving things, working, so on, alongside training (running and bodyweight.) This was usually due to just jobs/work that needed to be done at that time

During these times, I noticed I felt much healthier. I would sleep much better, eat healthier, my clothes were even feeling smaller, like my belt would be looser than normal and rest lower near my hips instead of my waist, which felt nice!! And my tummy was flatter it felt like

Problem is though I'm no longer doing that work and have lost a lot of that activeness. I play tennis multiple times a week and am trying to get back into running/calisthenics, but I'm quite a bit less active now. My belt and clothes are fitting normal now and sleep quality is worse, among other things. I'm scared I'm gonna get overweight although I've been told I have body dysmorphia online as well as from family, so I might just be scared for nothing. 

So I'm wondering if just getting my heart rate up throughout the day would be healthy, and maybe simulate my active lifestyle from before? Like maybe if I'm at home for the day just doing homework and chores, I could just like jump rope for a while every now and then or do some little form of movement to get my heart rate up? Or even just like doing tennis shadow swings and footwork, like what Nadal would do before games

Is this a good idea or am I just onto a whole lotta nothing? Can this make my heart/body stronger or more fit?

1onnh70,Arthritis and trying to get fit?,"Hello, 

I (37m 6'2"" 216lbs) have psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis. I recently got on new medication called Taltz which has been a godsend. For the first time in 20 years I can move mostly without pain. I started out walking about four months ago, then was able to do stationary bike workouts (nothing crazy, just pedaling for 30 or so minutes). So far I'm up to 3 mile walks every day at a good pace (3mph) and I can hit 200kj ouput on my peloton in 30 min (completely gassed after but I started at 118kj so seeing improvement). 

In the last month as I got more confidence and lost some weight (229lb at start and now 216) I started looking into fitness beyond just basic cardio. I have a good friend who is extremely fit and he was kind enough to do a session with me and show me some compound exercises to do to start out with (pushups, pull ups, inverted rows, dips, squats, glute bridges). 

I am so out of shape and weak that I need modifications on all these. In particular, I'm noting that my arthritis might be an issue still. I have pain in my left elbow, hands, and my right ankle still when I start making an effort. Hanging on a bar is incredibly challenging with my hands. 

Has anyone in here gone on a journey with arthritis? Is getting strong possible? Am I going to mess myself up if I can't do all exercises/muscles?   
  
I am grateful for any pointers to good compound exercise modififications for people with arthritis. I've found a few on youtube but a lot are geared for older people with what seems even more limited mobility than me so they don't do much for me. I feel like I'm in a weird spot where I have some strength and mobility I want to build on that places me above an infirm elderly person but I'm definitely not Arnold :'(",1762202765.0,3,2,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1onl9cx,Max Pull-Up progression problem,"Hi.
I’m having problems with improving my max pull-up count and I’m looking for advice. I started calisthenics about 8 months ago and improved rather quickly during the beginning. Got from around 4 pull-ups to 12 in around 4 months. Since then I didn’t really improve almost at all. 
The best set I was able to perform was 14 straight pull-ups, but there are days where I can’t get past 13.

Weirdly enough my weighted pull-ups increased consistently to where I’m able to perform 7 sets of 5 reps with 15kg additional weight. Furthermore I can do EMOM of 6 reps for 10 minutes. It just seems that I need a little rest between a certain amount of repetitions.

I do fully lock out on each rep and am trying to perform all my reps with decent form. My diet is pretty good but my sleeping habits are not (got 2 little kids, so my usual sleeping times varies between 4-6 hours/day). I’m weighing in at around 86kg.

Are there any tips to achieving a higher pull-up count? I don’t think I’m over-stressing my body by working out 3 times a week but I am concerned that additional grease the groove workouts might be too much…

Thanks in advance for your advice

I ask this question mainly because I see conflicting answers online (eg Ive seen people suggest you need to do a pull up with 80% bodyweight, and some people suggest 10+ pull ups is enough), and most people consider a “muscle up” to involve some kipping (which I’m not interested in). 

At the moment my weighted pull up PR is 5 controlled clavicle to bar reps with +60 lbs (~40% of my bodyweight). I haven’t really practiced muscle ups or explosive pull ups extensively, but when I try randomly I can easily pull to my lower chest and occasionally pull to my mid stomach. Once I get that high I have no idea what to do so I haven’t tried to “convert” it to a muscle up yet, but this should be enough requisite strength to do strict bar MUs right?

1olns9o,A big goal achieved!,"Hello to my favorite subreddit!

I am a 20F wlw calisthenics athlete, former gymnast and former powerlifter, who is currently in the early stages of recovery for ACL/MCL/Meniscus surgery. It’s been a tough, painful road. 

I actually tore my whole knee during one of the best gym sessions in my life. I was with one of my closest friends and was teaching her the very basics of calisthenics. As a fitness instructor who teaches many different forms of fitness to my community, I am a firm believer and promoter of the idea that bodyweight fitness is the most effective form of strength training, and should be everyone’s starting point. So I love to force my friends to take part sometimes LOL. Anyways, at the end of our gym session, we found a huge room in our college gym with a grass turf. I ended up doing some front and back flips for fun, landing them well. Unfortunately, on my last go at a front flip, I landed with my left knee straight, which led it to hyperextended and voila, tear up damn near my entire knee.

It’s bittersweet, because I’d never made more progress in not only my calisthenics journey but my life as a whole at that time. I was setting and achieving goals left and right. I had one particular goal that I’ve been working towards for over a year. That was to achieve 10 pull-ups. Its been extremely difficult for me because I am extremely strong in my lower body and chest, but its never been my back. It’s funny, because I could care less about training legs, I’ve always just wanted to be able to be extremely strong up top. Ya know, muscle ups and front levers and all that.

Well, today, 4 weeks post-op from surgery, I did it. I finally fucking did it. This recovery process has been so hard not even physically but mentally. It felt like I had lost myself, and it still feels like that sometimes as I watch my body change. But man, everything in life really happens for a reason. Thanks to this surgery, I don’t think I’ve ever been stronger in my upper body and my core than ever. Walking with crutches really gets you jacked with abs LOL. Unfortunately due to my intense lack of movement though, my abs are back to flabs 💔 but I’m locking in on my diet, and I’m so stoked to be here recovering well AND hitting huge milestones on my own accord that don’t have to deal with my injury.

Anyways, just wanted to share and if anyone is in my position right now, try to get some clearance from your surgeon to do pull-ups, L-sits, and dips. I’ve seriously never made more progress in my life up top.

Seems like a routine of varied pull-up workouts would produce solid results, but wanted to see what others think.

1ol2var,Ring HSPU Question,"Hola,

  
I skipped doing handstands and been mainly doing HSPU on rings with my feet hooked on a pullup bar. I'm not exactly how far off am I from doing the one in the air or feet hooked on the straps. I can do 90 degree bend for 6 reps so far. 

Yes, I'm aware I'm very dumb for moving towards that when I decided to run before learning how to walk. Anyways...

What accessories can I do to improve quicker aside from doing the exercise itself? As of now, I'm working on golfer elbow and mobilizing/strengthening my forearms... and Letting off steel mace work. 

For reference, I'm a fat fuck at 97kg and 175cm.

1ok82tm,Need advice on pull-up training,"So let me get this straight. I’m not really a calisthenics enthusiast, but I genuinely want to be able to do at least 15–20 pull-ups. My form is decent, but for some reason, sometimes it just feels extremely hard to do them. My current record is 13 reps. The way I train is simple and kinda stupid - I just do one maximum-effort set of pull-ups without any warm-up. I actually made fast progress this way, going from 5 to 13 reps pretty quickly, probably because I used to train in the gym a few years ago.

But after that, something weird started happening. My reps began to drop. Sometimes I can hit 13 pull-ups two days in a row, but then suddenly I can only do 8–10 or even less. I know this probably isn’t the best training method, maybe even one of the worst, but I don’t get any muscle soreness afterward, and I feel like I understand the movement better when I train like this.

The strange part is that when I actually try to warm up without any high intensity (and also after few days of rest) - I end up feeling tired for no reason and perform even worse. That’s what confuses me the most.

So I’m wondering what I should actually do. I can’t go a day without doing pull-ups, so maybe it’s fine to do them every day as long as I control the load and don’t go to failure. Should I add more sets instead of doing just one? Should I try pulling myself higher? Right now, I only go slightly above the bar with my chin.

And another weird thing I’ve noticed: even though I can do up to 13 pull-ups at my best, I can barely manage 20 push-ups - and when I do, it feels way harder than it should. It makes me wonder if there’s some kind of imbalance in my strength. Maybe my pulling muscles are much stronger than my pushing ones, or maybe my push-up form is just inefficient. Could it be that I’ve developed too much pulling strength compared to pushing, or that my stabilizers are just weak?

1ok61en,Pistol squats are hard man.,"When I do Pistol squats, it starts okay, fine even, but it soon gets fatiguing, my legs start wobbling, my balance starts to suffer, and with each set it gets worse, its especially noticeable on set 3 and 4. I try to do 15 reps x 4. My form gets worse due to overall fatigue, and then I can't stand up on my single leg. I try to push for more, and I feel like I maybe could force a few more reps, but those reps would'nt be of good quality. It feels like a slog, I have to really focus if I want to push hard. Achieving failure with pistol squats is truly hard, because there are many limiting factors.

The problem is, my head also gets dizzy, breathing is hard, there is a chance of me passing out. This exercise is exhausting, after it I don't want to do anything no more. It feels like cardio once you start going into the higher rep range, and it's harder to actually achieve failure.

Had some great recommendations on the Recommended Routine which I've been looking over and looking at the progressions.

I finally set up the Sports Royal Power Tower yesterday and instantly got carried away!

With the press up handles I ended up maxing out on 4 because I'm overweight but ended up spending half an hour doing sets all the way to zero until I literally couldn't hold myself up any more. I tried to maintain a slow controlled movement and just rested in-between until I felt ready again. Then I jumped on the dips and did static holds for as long as possible until I couldn't keep myself up.

It hurt (in a good way) but I loved it! My shoulders, chest and the backs of my arms are baked this morning.

Today I'm going to try and do a load of negative pull ups and dead hangs. Then do inverted rows until I'm literally spent. 

Then repeat a similar process with press ups and dips tomorrow but instead start with dips.

Is this a silly idea?

Long term I just want to get stronger and get my numbers up.

What are your thoughts on this? Could I structure this better? 

I can always do the RR if it's a bad idea.

1ojv7t1,Programming high volume chin ups per week,"Hi everyone,

A jacked friend of mine has been putting together a workout program for me. Ive already been working out for a couple of years, doing a combo of bodyweight and ‘normal’ barbell/DB workouts. 
Part of this new routine , along with a decent calorie surplus, is to work up to, and achieve 300 chin ups per week. 
So my question is, what is the best way to achieve this number each week , whilst being very conscious of potential injury. 

My idea is to firstly work up to this number over the course of a few weeks/months of increasing volume week on week. So say 80 the first week, 100 the next. 

Secondly make sure i have a rest day between sessions, this would mean (when at this volume) id be doing 100 mon/wed/fri . Other ways would be to do some each day, but this would mean no rest which sounds like a bad idea to me. 

Thirdly after an amazingly comprehensive warm up, ill use olympic rings , that hang about an inch off the bar so that my arms can follow a natural path rather than forced supination. 

What do people think? 
Ive been reading alot of posts but they all seem to be mostly people wanting to do excessive volume every day, which to me sounds like injury territory. ",1761817174.0,8,18,bodyweightfitness,fitness

Currently I do a full body workout M, T, Tr, F with cardio on W, all in the evening after work. Also cardio in the early morning before work if I wake up early enough. Weekends are for recovery and family time (I have 2 kids).

I recently replaced my Wed cardio evening with starting some calisthenics. I realize 1 day a week of body weight is not going to be adequate for my goal of hitting the planche. So my plan is right now to alternate weeks (1 week with my same lifting routine, and the next week 3 days of calisthenics with 2 days of cardio in between). I need advice on what to do for the 3 calisthenics days to build up to the planche. For strength references, I can do pullups 3 sets of 8 and dragon flags 3 sets of 8 with relatively controlled negative.

My Monday currently looks like this:

Pullups (3 sets)

Dips (2 sets of 15)

Planche bar pushups (2 sets of 15)

Pike pushups (2 sets of 15)

Inverted row (2 sets of 15)

Dragon flag (3 sets of 8)

L sit hold (2 sets of 30 seconds, but these are assisted with resistance band)

Bulgarian split squats (2 sets of 10) (I tried pistol squats but I can't keep my balance when I go down)

My PR for bodyweight dips is 8, but I can usually do between 5-6 reps. However, at times I’ll do one set where I can do about 3, and I feel like I’m really pushing it and going to failure, and next set I can bang out 7, dropping reps in the next few sets and then hitting 6/7 again a few sets later. I’m pushing myself to failure in every set, always resting the same time (about 3/4 minutes in between sets) and having my hands in the same position on the bars. 

On a side note, another issue with dips that I have is my reps and strength for them is much lower than for pull ups, which is usually the other way around for people. My pull up PR for bodyweight is 10, and for weighted it’s 1 x 12.5kg. The highest weight I’ve done for weighted dips was 1 x 7.5kg. 

I have that with other exercises at times, for example on the lever crunch machine- I did one set where I could only do 5 reps for 32kg, dropped down to 27kg for 12 reps, and on the next set I somehow did 32kg for 10 reps. I do pay attention to my form and most of my sets are done with the same form, so I don’t think that’s the issue. I have this issue with other exercises as well. Does anyone have a similar problem or a solution? ",1761594865.0,6,9,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1oho7g0,Recommendations for mobility/flexibility,"Hey everyone!

For some context — I started training calisthenics a while ago, first with RR and now with a coach. I’ve been making progress with the basics, but I still can’t do push-ups or pull-ups without assistance.
I train 3 times a week at home (2x full body + 1x legs), and I’d like to add some mobility work since I know it’s super important.

Do you guys have any good recommendations for mobility/flexibility programs I could follow (YouTubers, apps, whatever)?
Any other tips are also really appreciated!

1ohibrm,[OC] After 413 Days I Have Achieved a 5 Second One Arm Handstand!!!,"Full Video: [https://youtu.be/WluKlSyLDjk](https://youtu.be/WluKlSyLDjk)

Hey there r/bodyweightfitness! I wanted to share what is quite possibly the greatest milestone in my fitness career, the **5s** **One Arm Handstand**. In this thread I will provide a small breakdown of how I achieved this skill as well as context about my training and skill prior to the One Arm, but for a greater breakdown check out the linked video above!

Training range: **August 24th, 2024** to **October 16th, 2025 (413 days)** 

**H: 5'6.5, W:150lbs, M20-21, 45s-60s HS hold PRIOR to training One Arm**

Disclaimer: **MY ONE-ARM IS NOT PERFECT.** I started this journey initially thinking it wasn't going to take very long. Jokes on me I guess. My immediate go-to was doing basically the worst thing possible, just going for One Arm Holds. This is **NOT** the most efficient way to train. I think I wasted an incredible amount of time just sending for holds, instead of focusing on drills and improving flexibility and form along the way. If I can urge one thing to ANYBODY wanting to learn this skill, **FOCUS ON DRILLS FIRST, DO NOT COPY WHAT I DID**.

Now, how did I progress the skill?

  
**Favorite Exercises:**

\- **Wall Assisted Straddle Leans**: Seemed to have the most immediate transfer to the skill for me, helped understand how it felt to get in the right position

\- **General Wrist and Shoulder Flexibility Drills**: I.E. Butcher Blocks, Wrist Circles, Wrist Extensions. 

**Least Favorite:**

\- **The 54321 Finger Progression:** For me personally, I felt the least amount of progress with this drill, and it could be a possibility of me progressing between each one wrong, but I didn't think it helped me as much as it's praised too

\- **Bosu Ball**: This might be a controversial take, but the Bosu Ball One Arm is **ONLY** good at training the Bosu Ball One Arm, and transferring this skill to floor like I planned too didn't seem to quite work well training with the Bosu. I felt as if I had a ""Inflated"" skill level with the Bosu Ball when I should've still been focusing on the fundamentals.

  
**Key Takeaways:**

**Time:** Although progress will be slow, that doesn't mean you should ever quit pursuing the skill. There were weeks where my hold time only increased by a few milliseconds, and giving your body and mind time to heal is extremely beneficial.

**Training Amount:** I trained this skill 10-30 minutes every day, with **0 rest days.** I don't recommend this strategy for anyone who is not extremely disciplined in your warmup routine. **YOU WILL GET INJURED IF YOU DO NOT WARMUP PROPERLY**. Take it seriously. Your body is resilient, but not indestructible.

**Dedication:** I believe that this more than any skill requires simply **CONSISTENCY.** You will not unlock the One Arm unless you are dedicated to learning it. I promise. 

**IT IS POSSIBLE.**

I think this is the biggest aspect of the One Arm that scares so many people away from it. There is this stigma around the skill, that it's ""Impossible"", or requires some innate skill that you can never achieve, and me doing this video/challenge is a statement that anybody can achieve this skill with enough time and dedication. 

I am still working every day, my next goal is a 10s hold, and it **WILL** happen someday. Give me another year.

I appreciate all of you guys so much, and I will try my best to reply to any comments or questions!",1761580807.0,44,6,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1ohe0eg,Technical question: RTO pull-ups vs pronated/supinated grip on rings and weak range training,"I just bought a pair of rings, and the first thing I noticed was the RTO grip. As soon as you go up, your grip naturally rotates from pronated to supinated. The movement feels so clean and smooth — totally different from bar pull-ups.

My current EMOM routine looks like this:

5 min pull-ups on the bar

5 min chin-ups on the bar


That way, I work both patterns. As most of you know, in pull-ups the beginning is easier but the top portion is harder; while in chin-ups it’s the opposite.

What I realized is that RTO pull-ups on rings kind of merge the “easier parts” of both movements, so I lose the hardest portions of each.
That made me wonder:
Is it actually worth training the biomechanically weaker range of motion separately, or does it not really matter that much?

Another thing I noticed: on rings, even when you force a pronated or supinated grip, it’s never completely the same as on a bar — both end up being slightly neutral due to the ring angle.

So I’m considering two options:

Option 1:

Rings pull-ups (forcing pronated grip) – 5 min EMOM

Rings chin-ups (forcing supinated grip) – 5 min EMOM


Option 2:

Just RTO pull-ups – 10 min EMOM


What do you guys think? Does this make sense, or am I just overthinking it? 😂

Also, quick question about ring width:
My pull-up bar is 90 cm wide.
For shoulder-width pull-ups I use about 55 cm, and for wide grip I use the full 90 cm with no shoulder pain.

But when I tried wide ring pull-ups with the straps set to 90 cm apart — it almost wrecked my shoulder 😅.
I realized that as you pull up, the rings naturally open wider, increasing the angle.

So, does anyone know what a good ring spacing would be to safely simulate a “wide grip” without straining the shoulders?",1761570680.0,1,3,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1ohb67n,What’s the most underrated calisthenics skill every beginner should learn first?,"I’ve been training calisthenics consistently for a while now, and one of the biggest things I’ve realized is that most people (myself included when I started) chase the flashy stuff way too early.

It’s easy to get inspired by planches, front levers, and muscle-ups — they look incredible. But in reality, the skills that actually build you toward those goals are much simpler, and often overlooked. I wanted to open up a discussion here about what people think is the most underrated beginner skill in bodyweight training — the one that gives the best return long-term.

For me, that’s the frog stand (frog pose).

When I first learned it, I kind of saw it as a “filler” move — something to practice balance before moving onto handstands. But once I stuck with it, I realized it’s way more than that. It teaches wrist control, shoulder protraction, and core engagement — basically all the small stabilizing things that translate directly into more advanced work later ",1761562192.0,469,65,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1oh65gm,Increasing pull up reps,"It’s been a long journey but I can finally do a couple of pull ups. I’m currently doing pull ups 3 x week during my workouts with my reps being 2,2,2,1. I’m finding it really hard to increase to 3 reps. What would be the most effective way to increase my reps? Adding a 5th set? Open to any other suggestions. I would also rather do actual pull ups instead of regressing to negatives because after a year I’m so over negative pull ups, they would make me dread the workout instead of looking forward to it which I now do because I finally hit my goal of being able to do a pull up. 

Also I was thinking once I get to 3 reps to do the Russian fighter pull up program? Is this a good idea or better to just stick to reps/sets during my normal workouts? Thanks!

1oh5rhv,L-sit dip form,"I've been on dips in L-sit on rings for a few weeks.  I'm having a difficult time keeping my legs parallel to the ground when going down.  As I do, my body wants to rock forward, so at the bottom, my torso is parallel to the ground and my feet are pointing down.  Right now, I'm keeping them to 3 sets of five, and I don't think I should progress until the technique improves.

Do the legs need to stay parallel?  I'm fairly tall, so I'm guessing there's added difficulty there. My arms want to flare out more, but since the rings are on a doorway pull-up bar, they can't really go out far, anyway; but the demo videos I have seen show the arms go out a bit in dips.

I'm having no trouble with pull-ups in L-sit, and standard rings dips are fine.

1ogxp76,Best Equipment for Weighted Calisthenics?,"I'm still a beginner, so this is not of immediate concern but I see many calisthenic YouTubers recommending to eventually incorporate weights to calistenic exercises to make them harder. I'm talking mainly about weighted dips, pull ups, push ups and squats.

Now, there are many ways one could go about that,
all of them with their own pros and cons: a large bag or backpack filled with either water bottles or sand seems the most cheap, straightforward option out of the bunch.

If budget allows, you could also opt for a weighted vest or a the dip belt. Which I assume would be more comfortable and/or practical, especially for upper body exercises.

For the lower body, on top of that, there is also the option to just use the more ""tradicional"" weights in the form of dumbbells, kettlebells or a barbell. 

You could used this to make bodyweight leg exercises, such as the pistol squat, harder, or just replaced them entirely in favor of weighted training. This option seems the best for people who already have access to a gym or own weights themselves.

Now, for the sake of argument, let's say you do not have access to a gym, but are willing to spend some money in order to get the equipment needed.

Out of all the options mentioned above, which one would you say is the best one overall? Taking into account: comfort and ease of use, affordability of the equipment and escalability of the exercises.",1761517138.0,2,22,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1ogwabg,"I’d like to start learning callisthenics but I’m overweight/obese, so give me some tips?","I’m a female, 5’8” and currently around 210 pounds. My goal is to get down to roughly 155–165 pounds and feel stronger and healthier overall. I’ve been doing home workouts, walking ~10k steps a day, and keeping a calorie deficit. I was 99 kg (~218 lbs) when I started, about 1.5 months ago, I was down to 94 kg (~207 lbs), but now I’m back up to 95–96 kg in the past week. I feel stuck at this plateau and I’m not sure how to push past it.

My bigger goal, though, is learning calisthenics. I’ve always admired people doing push-ups, pull-ups, handstands, and other bodyweight skills, but I can’t even do a single proper push-up yet. I know I’m overweight, but I want to know if it’s even possible for someone like me to start calisthenics and actually progress?

I used to be a gym goer, I’m not anymore and I don’t have the means to go either so I’ll be managing with at home workouts only. I use a pair of dumbbells and resistance bands. I’m not sure how to structure a plan that helps me get to full push-ups and eventually more advanced moves safely.

So I’m turning to you for help on two main things:

Calisthenics for overweight beginners: 
How do I start effectively? What exercises or progressions will help me gradually build the strength and confidence to do push-ups, dips, and eventually harder moves? Any tips for staying safe and motivated would be amazing.

Breaking weight plateaus: How have you dealt with weeks (or months) where the scale refuses to budge? Should I adjust my calories, add more cardio, focus on strength training, or is this just a matter of staying consistent and patient?

I know this is a journey, and I’m trying to stay consistent and realistic. I’m proud of the progress so far, but I want to keep moving forward. Any advice, routines, or personal experiences from people who’ve been in a similar spot would mean a lot.

1ogk34i,Weight Lifting vs Callisthenics for over 60s,"I'm wondering what everyone's thoughts are regarding types of exercise for strength as we get older. Specifically, Weight Lifting vs Callisthenics.

A bit of background. I'm 60 and I've had long covid for 5 years, so I'm was/am very deconditioned compared to myself at a younger age. Any aerobic-based exercise made me much worse. About a year ago, I found I could do anaerobic exercise without inducing post-exercise malaise and 6 months ago I started the 'Starting Strength' lifting program, which has helped many older people substantially increase their physical health. This involves Squats, Bench Press/Overhead Press and Deadlifts. I was worrying about sarcopenia when I started, weighing only 55Kg, but I have increased my muscle mass and worked up to squatting 48Kg, benching 44Kg and deadlifting 55Kg. 

I went carnivore several months ago and realising the link between histamine and long covid has meant I have improved even more. I now occasionally climb indoors. In my opinion, this is showing some of the 'weakness' of the Starting Strength program. My stomach and hamstrings often feel close to spasming during some simple climbing moves, and the upper back muscles that are used in climbing are not increasing much in strength. My ability to stand on a wobble board was also limited. A small jump down from a climb would cause pain in an old knee injury. So  I've been adding in things like pullups, planks, glute bridges and hanging leg raises. I'm thinking of working on moves like the front lever that would be highly beneficial for my bouldering

These are my thoughts at the moment. The Starting Strength program has certainly increased the strength of my quads, glutes, pectorals and lower back. Lifting heavy will certainly keep my bones strong and maximise my muscle mass as it declines from age. But is it optimal for staying healthy as I get older? 

A good callisthenics program will involve a high level of 'skill training'. Will that produce more neural adaptation? Would that benefit us as we get older in terms of balance and coordination? But then it would not have the same potential to generate muscle mass as lifting, so would age-related muscle mass become more of a problem?

If I swapped to prioritising callisthenics, where would I start?

1og29rv,Paused chest to bar pull-up = the next progression of inverted row?,"Inverted rows question: would paused chest-to-bar pull-ups, with a real upper-back squeeze, no momentum, be  a harder bodyweight progression of the inverted row?

Most people who claim to do “chest-to-bar” reps are just explosive touch-and-go. I’m talking pause at the bar, show control, and actually feel mid/lower traps + rhomboids working, like you’re “breaking the bar” apart. At the top, your torso can lean back (think slight bridge), so the pattern becomes more row-like even though the pull is vertical.

In terms of difficulty, a strict, paused chest-to-bar should be close to a 100% bodyweight paused inverted row. (For reference: feet-elevated inverted rows load about \~70% bodyweight, so matching that “top-end” is like adding \~+30% to a full-ROM row.)

""You can't do pull ups/dips/push ups every day, you'll get injured/won't recover"" 

Very wild to see this. For anyone with some mild period of strength training experience and a resonable level of full-body tolerance (meaning in the sense you don't have some particular weakness - grip strength for example, that might immediately cause your problems, tennis elbow), daily bw training with the *same* exercises should be easily recoverable, and allow you to **progress**.

(Base) bw movements are nothing like heavy barbell compounds. Try and deadlift to failure 3x a week and you will probably start to feel like crap very rapidly.

Couple of sets of pull ups everyday, to technical failure, is really nothing. It's a ""full body"" exercise, but not in the same sense that a barbell back squat or deadlift is a full body exercise. You're not loading the absolute shit out of your whole body, should just be taxing your lats and upper back the most if your form and conditioning for the exercise is good. It would be fairly challenging to generate enough localized fatique to your back that you start to decline, and if it causes systematic fatique, that's probably an indicator of generally poor recovery, and conditioning.",1761381542.0,0,19,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1ofb6yd,Daily push-ups kinda screwed my shoulders and I wasn’t expecting that,"So I got into this habit a few months ago where I’d drop and do push-ups basically whenever I remembered. Morning, during work breaks, waiting for food to heat up, etc. Felt good. Numbers went up. Tiny ego boost.

Then my shoulders started feeling… off.  
Nothing crazy, just this weird tightness in the front, a little clicking, and when I sat at my desk my whole upper body felt like it was slowly folding forward. I couldn’t get comfortable.

I figured it was just soreness, so I stretched more. Didn’t help.

Eventually I talked to someone about it and they asked: “How much pulling are you doing?”

And yeah, I was doing zero. Literally all push, no pull. Didn’t even think about it.

I started adding some really basic pulling stuff like:

* rows under a table
* some face-pull-ish movements with a band
* light back/serratus work

Not even a lot. Like 5–10 mins. Within two weeks the tightness chilled out, my shoulders stopped clicking as much, and push-ups actually felt stronger.

Which sucks because it’s such an obvious fix, but apparently I had to learn it the dumb way.

Anyway, if you’re doing daily push-ups and your shoulders feel weird, maybe add a little pulling. Doesn’t need to be fancy.

1of666c,Isometric workout,"We seem to have reasonable evidence that isometrics at long muscle length are at least equivalent to similar time straight sets for hypertrophy.

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40911904/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40911904/)

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30580468/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30580468/)

But in studies most isometrics are at intensities that are matched to the normal sets. In effect work with a constant tension and stop when can no longer produce the target force. However, why not work at higher intensity, and continue even when force production drops, wouldn't this be analogous to a drop set? Drops sets which we know produce much more hypertrophy (when we compare entire drop set with all its levels to a single hard set). 

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37523092/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37523092/)

As truly maximal force production is mentally difficult when you see no outcomes of it, we might as well aim at that maximal force production and assume we end up at maybe 85-95%. Then trying to produce maximal force for 45 seconds should ensure we end up with some kind of drop set effect.

We can pause the contraction briefly to readjust into a deeper stretch when feasible and position allows for it. It might mimic PNF stretching to some extent and hopefully improves range of motion even more, while of course allowing for a better stretch on the muscle.

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37301370/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37301370/)

Then it just comes down to finding some movements, where we can produce that maximal force by a muscle that is elongated position, here are my candidates and the muscles that can likely be contracted maximally while elongated.

\- seated forward bend, try to straighten, while pulling on to the toes. (erector spinae, glutes, hamstrings, calves, lats, teres major, forearms)

\- appley stretch, hold on to a rope/stick, and try to pull it apart. (upper arm: triceps, teres major, latissimus dorsi, subscapularis. lower arm: triceps, anterior deltoid, infraspinatus, teres minor) 

\- bow pose, try to straighten, while pulling on to the toes. (iliopsoas, quads, pecs, tibialis anterior, forearms)

\- standing pancake, try to slide feet together on a high friction surface. (hip adductor)

\- lying on the side, bottom arm extended behind palm on the ground, bottom leg extended in front, try to slide together the palm and the ankle which are resting on a high friction surface. (pecs, biceps, external obliques, hip abductors)

\- low horse stance, grab on to opposing shin with each arm, try move the knees out and extend hip, while trying to uncross the arms. (rhomboids, middle trapezius, middle deltoids, glutes, forearms)

In practice, I count 30 breaths, for each position. This results in roughly in 45 seconds because the breathing becomes more rapid as the hold goes on. I do the readjustment into a deeper stretch in appley stretch, standing pancake and seated forward bend. I do this routine 3 times per week after sports, i.e I'm already warmed up.

Do you have any better candidates for the moves? I have noticed in practice the low horse stance is problematic because the systemic load is so massive, Im hyperventilating towards the end. Also it's difficult to remember to recruit all the muscles for example appley stretch pull apart, you can do it with either triceps or shoulder muscles, and it takes concentration to remember to use both simultaneously. As such I should probably opt for more isolation style moves where possible.",1761332110.0,10,3,bodyweightfitness,fitness

I can do 3/4 of a Pull up when my hands are closer together. When I jump up to the bar I can't lower myself in a controlled way. When my hands are wide I can't even get going. 

I can jump up into a dip position but can't push myself back up again! 

Chins i can pull myself up 3/4 of the way again but I'm shaking all over the place and can't do a full rep. 

Can do 3 sets of 5 press ups.

I'm only going to be training at home but ultimately I want to focus on building muscle and getting bigger in the long run, but I obviously have to get my strength up first. 

So my main question is, how can I build up to being able to do these exercises? 

Are there any other bodyweight exercises that I should incorporate?

1oezl6p,Comparing stand alone bars,"I was looking at buying a pull up bar and my space allows for a few different options. I have 8’ ceilings in the bedroom I could put it in or vaulted ceilings in my living room.

I don’t want anything permanent set up in the living room and I worry about the base bars stability. The bull bar doesn’t have a straight bar so I’m curious how well rings would work because of that and my height. Basically the bull bar would work but I’m trying to justify the base bar because of the price difference even though it would be limited to the 8’ ceiling height.

1oest5z,Questions about Navy Seal Burpees + Six Count Burpees.,"Completely new to burpees. I've done them before but never consistently. They became part of my weekly program about two weeks ago and I've learnt quite a bit since starting.

I'd like to know if this ""test"" has a name. Ten minutes of Navy seals followed by ten minutes of six counts. It seems others are also aware of it. 

I came across a post yesterday and decided I'd give part of it a try this morning. The goal, thirty NVS in twenty minutes. Ended up finishing thirty in 7:39 minutes. I then pushed to forty which I got done in 8:58.  
I was absolutely gassed and considered going for the six counts but chose not to (weak) since the initial goal was only to do the thirty Navy seals.

The NVS burpee I did was the three push-up one where you bring your right knee to your left elbow and vice versa between push-ups.   
Which is the actual NVS burpee? The one with the knee to elbow or without?

Anyways, I'll probably give this another go on Monday morning with the six counts in the second ten minutes and see what I get.

I was also hoping to get more info on the ""Levels"" someone mentioned in a another post.

1oesn81,4 Calisthenics Exercises for Long Term Progression,"These are some calisthenics exercises which I consider to be goated:

[The Pendulum Sissy Squat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tln44Dg5MP0) \- this variation has you attatch a daisey chain to a door or fixture point so that you are able to use a dip-belt or harness to take the sissy squat through a deeper range of motion

[The Tear Drop Squat](https://youtu.be/aF9dWYfloOQ?si=JnBOAKS1qzojimlm&t=290) \- looks easy but the exercise burns the VMO like nothing else, developed by kneesovertoes guy for knee health but found it to be exceptional for targeting this area of the leg.

[Deficit Decline Pushup](https://youtu.be/BeS6eOYKQ8s?si=cK5NDUfK-7eEhkGC&t=189) \- because of the elevation you're able to take the range of motion significantly deeper, the deeper the decline gradient the greater the upper chest stimulus, hands wide for more chest

[Strict Calf Raise](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/haHcBAd637E) \- flex the calf under the weighted stretch back up to neutral, single leg variation lets you progress for longer; and then even 20kg on a dip belt on a single leg it'll challenge you for a long period, i'd personally do lengthened partial myoreps for 50 reps but try for yourself

For reference I use bands but their attributes lend theirself to isolations better than compounds and for like hoziontal pressing especially you've got to make a choice between stability and no tension or tension and no stability, and sure you can do a single arm chest fly but theres something that feels good about recruiting the chest, serratus anterior, and anterior delt in unsion with a press.

I been taking the bands serious for a couple months and put an inch on each arm and I find these awesome for the delts too, but it's more of an experience curve with bands it feels like compounds lock you in similar to like a machine at a gym which guides your body in the right movement and leverages. I think deficiet handstand pushups are something I will try at some point though just to see how it compares to a band press.

1oefpl8,Full body workouts getting too long and tiresome,"So I’ve been training for a while doing a workout based on but slightly altered version of the RR. I do it 3 times a week. Recently as I’ve gotten more ambitious with my goals I feel like my workouts are getting too tiresome as well as taking too much time. For example if I want to both handstand push ups, planche progression and front lever progression on top of all the basic stuff + legs it is way too tiresome and takes forever to complete. 

I’m wondering if I’m doing something wrong here or if I should consider doing a new split, for example one where I train more often than 3 times a week or just change it a bit. 

Some of the alternatives could be: two times upper and one time lower where I get a bit more time on the upper workouts to actually do everything I want. The con is one time less upper every week (and legs…) but that might be sufficient to progress? 

Maybe I could do a ppl 6x or ppl 5x a week where I only do legs once a week. This method I’d be able to shirten down my workouts but have to train lore frequently. I’ve seen some complain of the fact that this method doesn’t ensure enough proper restdays so idk. 

Or maybe push pull full body and legs? This way I hit everything twice. But here again It’s gonna be a problem on the full body day - the same as my initial issue. I guess I could also do push pull legs upper or just upper 3 times a week and legs once. 

I have honestly no idea what the best method is so that’s why I’m asking for help. I need a split that ensures I’m able to train the different stuff I want to without being insanely tired affecting performance or it taking too much time at once. ",1761254774.0,76,19,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1oe6frr,"How effective is casual everyday ""greasing the groove""  VS  2-3 gym sessions per week","Hi,

Recently I've read here and there about different workout routines.

One thing that caught my attention was that some guys do basic bodyweight exercises in cycles like pushups, pullups, dips, rows, squats, bicep/tricep stuff for 20-30 minutes, everyday or almost everyday, sometimes even twice a day, or just at random when they feel like it.

I have no experience in that specifically but it seems like a very natural way of training, where progress seems to be faster since there is more volume accumulated in general and body is more used to more frequent fatigue/effort.

That is quite the opposite to preplanned 2-4 times a week set/reps workout sessions at gym, which I'd doing now and I'm tired after each, but still, for some reason it feels like I'm faking it cause three workouts per week seems like it's some kind of big event and there's no real muscle action in between.

What's your experience?

Doorway mode: Started with dead hangs because I couldn't do a single pull up. Now I can do 6-7. The grip positions actually matter. Wide grip hits my lats way more than narrow.  

Floor mode: Using it for elevated push ups changed everything. My wrists used to hurt like hell with regular push-ups. Now I can actually do them pain-free and get a deeper range of motion.  

Dip mode: Flip it over and the lower handles are perfect for tricep dips. My arms are way more defined now.  

The best part? I can do a full upper body workout in like 20 minutes right in my apartment. Pull ups for back, push ups for chest, dips for triceps. That's literally it.

I work a desk job and on top of that I’m a mom of two. There are days that I struggle to reach 10K steps, but will sometimes go for an evening walk or run and that’ll get me to at least 10K if not more! 

I’m in the best shape of my life. I run 4-5x a week and mix in strength workouts and Pilates throughout the week too! I sometimes do 2 workouts a day (one in the AM and one in the PM). I try to walk with my kids a lot too. 

Even still, it’s always discouraging to see people hitting 20K steps on a daily basis. I always wish I could see that tbh. On a good day, with lots of walks and maybe a run mixed in, I will hit 12-15K steps. On a day I don’t intentionally go for walks/runs, I may only hit 5-7K steps - but that’s including a workout as well. 

I guess with all this said I’m just wondering how important is it really? Have YOU personally still had good success while not reaching your step goal each day? ",1761094022.0,181,87,bodyweightfitness,fitness

I want to ascertain where I'm at to know what next? When do you move on and what to move on to? (Stuff like levers, muscle ups, handstands? Is that what people go to?)

I started out with the RR but then started splitting it up and adjusting as needed along the way. Major movements remained the same though. I do some other/accessory exercises as well (arms, deadlift, calf etc.)

Good reactions. When I started calisthenics I just took the RR and ran with it. Reason I'm asking here is because I do notice it is getting difficult to do progressive overload per training while retaining my preferred ROM and form. So this was meant as a sanity check and a ""what next?"" 

But from what I gather, the mode of progression for calisthenics does not necessarily follow the bodybuilding/powerlifting logic of ""just add weight and reps with good form.

Maybe this is a dumb question. I'm a beginner (39F), well getting back into fitness. I want to become strong, fit and functional. I'm overweight, but with a strong build (naturally broad back). 

I can lift weights (squat, deadlift, overhead press etc), but I can't manipulate my bodyweight as one does with bodyweight/calisthenics. 

I'm currently following a Rings program with lots of beginner variation and progressions. I am doing pull ups (toes on the floor), static holds, bicep curls, triceps skullcrushers, push ups, dips, Rows, tucked L Sits. I enjoy the pull up progressions and the Rows but find the dips, push ups and tucked L Sits very difficult. 

So should I continue with the Rings and do the program slow and steady, or as a beginner should I switch to weights and bodyweight for stuff like push ups, dips, bicep curls, tricep work etc until I get stronger and then switch back to the rings?

1ocdwfz,Should pullups/chinups be approached the same way as sprinting,"Yeah I know a bit of an unusual title but hear me out.

  
So lately I have done a bit of quarter rep chinups to strenghten the bottom part of the motion. It is also useful for me since it allows me to add a bit more volume without overdoing it in terms of fatigue.

  
I have because of this reflected on if chinups can be approached like sprinting. 

  
In sprinting speed is gained for the first 20-30 meters and anything beyond it is merely attempting to keep the speed high. 

  
Likewise when people are wants to learn to do ""chest to bar pullups"" they are told that it is mainly a matter of being explosive enough from the bottom portion of the movement.

  
**question:** So here is my question would it make sense to mainly focus on the first part of the movement over the mid and top part of the movement like how sprinters mainly focus on generating power from the start block? I cant really see the trade off in terms of gaining massive speed generation at the beginning compared to have a more even strenght across the whole range of the movement. 

  
Do these thoughts / ideas I have actually make sense?

1ocbbik,I tracked hydration for 60 days and here's how it affected my training (data included),"I've been doing bodyweight training for three years. Progress had plateaued hard. Couldn't figure out why. My programming was solid, sleep was decent, nutrition was dialed in.

Decided to track one more variable: hydration. Used WaterMinder for 60 days straight and tracked performance metrics for pullups, dips, and pistol squats.

Baseline (Days 1 through 15):

Average daily water intake: 2.1L

Pullup max: 14 reps

Dip max: 22 reps

Pistol squat (each leg): 8 reps

Intervention (Days 16 through 60):

Increased water intake to 3.5 or 4L daily (adjusted for workout days)

Set reminders every 90 minutes

Front loaded 1L before morning workout

Results (Day 60):

Pullup max: 17 reps (+21%)

Dip max: 26 reps (+18%)

Pistol squat (each leg): 11 reps (+37%)

What surprised me:

Recovery between sets improved noticeably. Rest periods decreased from 3 minutes to 2 minutes without performance drop.

Joint discomfort (especially elbows during dips) reduced significantly. Hydration affects connective tissue more than I realized.

Pump during workout was better, which probably indicates better blood flow and nutrient delivery.

Limitations:

Can't isolate hydration as the only variable (placebo effect, progressive overload, etc). But the timing and magnitude of improvements align closely with hydration changes.

The app itself is basic. Just tracks intake and sends reminders. But having consistent data helped me see patterns I'd been missing for months.

Anyone else track hydration alongside training metrics? What did you find?",1761048947.0,130,15,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1obwjzd,"Not sure if its for you, but this is my favorite method of BW progression...","One of the biggest challenges for bodyweight athletes is figuring out how to progress consistently. Usually, this means adding reps, time, weight, or changing leverage. The method I’m about to share can use all of those, but it also includes a built-in protocol and a deload phase.

I’m not claiming this is the best way to progress, just one way. It has worked great for me, and I’ve seen steady strength gains for over a year. Hopefully, it helps someone else too.

**Summary**  
I call this the 40-60 Method. You take any exercise, isometric or isotonic, and you discover your max reps (with or without weight), or hold time. Based on that max number, you calculate your rep scheme. There is a re-test period every 4th workout, and an adjustment of the reps. 

**Implementation**  
There are 4 workouts in every cycle. The cycle is as follows: Max day, workout 1, workout 2, workout 3.  
After the 3rd workout, you start another cycle with a re-test max day. You can do two to three workouts (including max day) a week but no more.   
  
Take an exercise, like the plank. The max day is one set and its a MAX set. So for plank, say your max is 60 seconds. That's it, you're done for the day. 

**Workout 1** you take your max of 60 seconds and you multiply it by 0.4 (60 x 0.4). That equals 24. Add it to 60. 60+24 = 84. Now for workout 1 your total time in the plank position should be 84 seconds. But this is spread out over 4 sets (I found 4 sets to work best for me). You can divide the 84 seconds up over the 4 sets any way you like, as long as you accomplish the 84 seconds total (example 21, 21, 21 ,21). Rest between the sets is anywhere from 30 seconds to 1 minute. I like 30 seconds. 

If for whatever reason you cannot do 84 seconds total, then re do the workout the next time you train, and continue doing so until you can reach 84 seconds total before progressing. 

**Workout 2.** Same protocol as workout 1 except Multiply your max by 0.5. 

60 x 0.5 = 30.            30+60 = 90 seconds.               Now complete 90 seconds total over 4 sets. 

**Workout 3** Same protocol. Just multiply your max by 0.6. 

  
**New Cycle - Max Day** Congrats. Do another max day. I have been using this method for a year and a half and only had 5 or 6 times i didn't make progress on a max set. So in other words, I have almost ALWAYS had strength gains.

**What about using reps?** Same thing. Say your pushup max is 10 pushups. Apply the same mathematics to your max reps. Ex. 10 x 0.4 = 4. 10 + 4 = 14. Do 14 reps over 4 sets. 

  
**How far does it go?** Where do we stop? Well, that's up to you.  I find doing sets for a two minute max is very hard. So with this in mind, create a rep ceiling for yourself. I personally find that once I can do 60 seconds of an certain isometric hold, I progress by changing the leverage or by adding weight. 

For exercises that use reps schemes, I have my rep ceiling at 20 reps. Once I can hit 20 reps, I change the exercise by adding weight, or changing leverage. But the number is arbitrary. 

**How much should each max set progress?** Depends. I've had huge leaps of 15 to 20 seconds on holds, and I've had as low as 3-4 second increases on holds. Strength is not linear. Be patient and listen to your body. 

**Will I build muscle?** Yes, this progression method builds muscle. I had added muscle to my own body using it. Progressive overload is key to adding muscle and strength. But of course, you need to eat enough protein and cals.  For pure strength, you can focus on lower rep ceilings (Ex, 20 second holds). Anything past 60 seconds reaches into the territory of endurance. All rep schemes can build muscle and strength, its just that certain ranges are more suited to specific goals. 

**Credit**

Its been awhile, but I believe the inspiration for this progression came from an Athlean X protocol designed for increasing pullups. ",1761000979.0,79,38,bodyweightfitness,fitness

Is it a good idea to implement one isolation exercise in my calisthenics sessions (PUSH/PULL) to maximize the progress? For example add 3 sets of biceps curl on my pull day, to help on the weighted pull-ups, and 3 sets of chest press on the push day to improve my weighted dips.

PUSH

Rope for 3 min, Warm-up  for 10 min, 3 working sets of weighted dips, bw dips over bar, max push-ups x4 of different styles

I've always had the image in my head that the wide grip pull up or wide grip lat pull down was the non-negotiable for lat focus. But I've cut it out recently and have been doing just pronated shoulder width, and narrower grip chin ups and narrow grip neutral pull ups. I've never felt my lats working this hard... ever.

I also got rings recently, and i'd definitely say they were worth it. Since they allow for the whole free rotation of the hand they let me engage muscle groups better (especially lats), but even wide grip pull ups with them don't hit my lats very well. Close grip hammer pull ups and close grip chin ups still light my lats up on every rep. I feel like it's honestly a bit of a distraction. The time where I will use a wide grip on a pulling excersise is on rows, since a wider grip emphasizes traps and rear delts. Those are also the muscles that do most of the work in a horizontal pull, so I think it makes more sense there.

what I wonder is what these really are for bodyweight exercises. Obviously it's way harder to gauge because an 80kg bench is 80kgs, but a push up intensity will vary due to bodyweight, form (therefore levers) etc.

(Mind-muscle connection, flexibility)","Hi everybody, I would like to ask what's some good exercises to gain good scapula control in all ranges of motion. My mind-muscle connection in the shoulder and scapula area is bad. I'm not looking necessarily at strength, I want to have proper control, and prepare for intermediate calisthenics exercises.

I know that it's normal to have *some* asymmetry but I feel I'm not engaging the muscles at all in some exercises, feels weird and annoying. Been training for 1 year bodyweight, took a few months off, now I'm back, I've always had this problem and I'd like to improve it. After the break it's worse, but it was always pretty bad.

Some personal examples: 

* **Dips**: both shoulders are not always level because I can't control my scapula well, it's getting better with controlled shrugs on dip bars, but I struggle to stay level in the bottom-middle position
* **Lateral raises**: just by imitating the lateral raise motion without any weight I can clearly see one side (arm, shoulder, and scapula seen from the back) are different to the other one as I can't control the scapula, I feel one's more out and one's more in if that makes sense, I can't activate the shoulder and scapula properly, if I focus really hard I can for a brief second without any weight
* **Pull ups**: in the last reps I struggle and I feel one scapula giving up while the other stays engaged, scapula pull ups are helping a bit but still happens sometimes
* **Push ups**: doing some videos from the back I noticed both scapula are not symmetrically engaged, also when looking in a mirror from the front one's more down and one's more up in the middle of the execution, but at bottom and top they are level

My ROM is different from left to right shoulder (external & internal rotation), and I can do the ""clasp hands behind back"" exercise with one side but not the other, should I also do shoulder stretches to try and have both sides with the same range, together with the scapula exercises?

My vertical scapula control is not horrible, put the other planes really need some work, what exercises to do?

1o9lva6,Has anyone had really poor hypertrophy results with bwf?,"""Dips, pull ups etc. build the upper body""... where is the mass though?

Over a long period of time I've gained a fair amount of mass (10-15kgs), so obviously that's a big difference. I note though, that I see people of similar build to me have a near identical level of lean mass as me, but maybe than barely do a pull up, or only a handful of push ups.

Feats such as +25kg chin ups, or pulling into basic levers, or even pelican curls seem to have little bearing on my physique. I'm not significantly strong by any means, but I certainly appear a lot weaker than I am. Pretty funny arm wrestling someone a lot bigger than you, and being able to just pull their upper body across the table, or being able to easily huck 35kg bags around with one hand

I don't even train for strength. Most of my sets are 0-1 RIR, I always slow the negative right down, aiming to maximize tension in the lengthened portion, or whatever that means. Literally have zero chest, or back. The only place that shows that ""maybe I train"" is my arms, which seem to hold more lean mass than the average untrained person. But that's it really.

I hear that a lot of people have ""amazing"" results with even just push ups, but I'm wondering if that's an exaggeration, or has anyone else experienced something similar? Like in a couple years of training, my chest has grown to the point where it's still smaller than that of the average person who doesn't train, but isn't significantly overweight or sedentary. 

It's not a case where I just need to lean down either. Like yes my bodyfat isn't low, but if I were to cut down, I would just be small overall.",1760759753.0,38,47,bodyweightfitness,fitness

I’m a 33M high school wrestling coach looking to settle in to a bodyweight routine. I’ve spent the better part of the last 3-4 years working through different programs and have run into some challenges. My shoulders are trashed. I’ve had numerous surgeries in each should to clean-up various frays and cysts throughout my rotator cuff. Most recently I found out that I have longitudinal tears in my bicep tendon in both arms. Heavy lifting just causes debilitating inflammation. If I have a few bad days of eat eating, I experience the same. 

Ultimately I am looking to simplify things and focus on settling into my body. Bodyweight exercise feels great and I’ve noticed minimal issues when sticking to it. The crazy thing about my situation is actual wrestling does not cause discomfort in my shoulders, however as soon as I add weight training I struggle.  

Currently I mostly focus on cardio and core. I also do about 250-300 push-ups 3-4 days per week. I have no real plan or focus though, it’s more just staying active, as I have found it fits my lifestyle well because I build it into my day. 

Any suggestions on how to tackle bodyweight? I’m looking at being a little more structured with my approach where I can establish goals beyond being active.

Everything I buy is pastured raised, 100 percent grass-fed, and grass-finished, organic only.

I do my workouts exclusively calisthenics only. I workout 5 days a week. My training consists of a dynamic fullbody warm up.

After the warm-up I do 30x regular push-ups, 20x archer push-ups, 20x typewriter push-ups, 20x wide push-ups, 10x pull-ups, 10x dips, 2 times 15x diamond push-ups per side while holding one leg raised, and 10x grip pull-ups.

I do not take steroids or any other substances.

Like explosiveness, stamina and another form of cardio in it's own way. I've been playing around various forms of pushups and squats and wrestler bridges, (I do not recommend this) and some form of isometric contraction exercises like the horse stance and some form of overhead movements like pike pushups and hip-elevated bear crawls. The exercises I have executed in not the best of forms, especially push-ups. Lately I've been doing some old school calisthenic workouts. High intensity, high rep, high volume and frequency. I just want to ask about muscle soreness, because bodyweight training soreness is not the same as weight training soreness. I've visited the gym once, did 2 sets of tricep rope pushdowns and got extremely sore the next morning. But everytime I push my ass to failure on diamond pushups and normal push-ups I do not get sore. I only get sore if I train 3 days in a row, and even then I can grind up sets of 50 push-ups. I know time is a factor in muscle building, but I've heard it said that farmers, laborers, military soldiers and basically manual laborers—they use their muscles everyday to do their work and still get big without proper rest times.

I noticed I have a potentially good spot for a simple bar. See photos here: [https://postimg.cc/gallery/NLMGy6b](https://postimg.cc/gallery/NLMGy6b)

That's a solid concrete wall (the white painted part) but the problem is **I'm a renter** so I can't do any damage to the wall or door frame.

Looking for recommendations to purchase a **good simple bar**. I'm only a small guy - currently 66kg so it doesn't need to be amazing in its capacity, but of course I want full reassurance I'm not gonna fall on my back.

I live in Europe (Estonia).

The muscle-up might have to wait until I can get outside again, but for now the ceiling is high enough that I can hopefully comfortably continue chin and pull ups.

Any tips much appreciated!",1760427239.0,1,9,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1o68zj6,Stretching and mobility,"I’m 21 years old, and for years I’ve noticed that I’m not flexible AT ALL and it concerns me (there’s some range of motion that I can’t do and I feel like I should. Im technically overweight, but my weight is not my issue). I think my muscles/nerves are too tight and that if I don’t work on my mobility soon, it’ll cause health issues in the long run and it’ll be much harder to move as I get older. How do I work on it? Are there specific doctors that work on this? How can I look this is up? (Is there a proper terminology?). Every time I try to look up ways, I feel like “well I guess this is supposed to help” but never feel any real progress. And it’s not that anything hurts, I’m just really stiff and don’t have good range of motion. 

Some of my concerns are like my back, joints on knees, wrists strength, leg motion, and shoulders (I also think I’m developing a hunch back, and would like to find stretches I can do to help it). How do I ensure that I’ll be able to keep moving as I get older?

* Chest press gr2005-1-48a-w
* Cross contry ski gr2005-1-09
* Air walker gr2009-5-06

* 3 person static combo gr2005-1-71 (pullup, dips, and situps)
* Back and arms combo gr2005-1-42
* Leg press gr2009-5-05

Distance wise from where I typically come from, this is a decent distance to get some cardio going with a light jog to the park... so the brain juices got flowing, tax payer outdoor gym with no membership fee (except my taxes), and I have no clue about a routine I can follow or what these machines do or how I can best use them and make up for what they can't do.

I certainly want to get my back and posture in better health, as well as develop some more upper body strength. I'd like to pick up my mom's 60lb meatball of a dog with more ease.

I try to do some weight training but I often find it rather boring/tedious. My long term goal is to get better calisthenics anyways

1o6368o,"Help, I can't tell if my progress is unusually slow. Also, rate my routine :3","Hello. I've been doing calisthenics for a few years now but I feel as though I'm still a beginner, I might be starting to look athletic, at least without clothes off. To be honest my first years doing calisthenics training I was such a noob, I was learning things on my own and just adapting according to my experience, aka, how tired I felt after a few weeks of training and taking volume away because I went hard six days a week lol, I thought it was supposed to suck. I would say I've been doing my training okay for about a year now, I'm still not very literate about routines and exercising but I doubt I'm not training hard enough (I could be wrong).  
  
My routine kind of looks like this:

Monday:  
Incline pull ups: 5 sets 8-9 reps  
Leg raises:  3 sets 12 reps  
Bicep curls: 3 sets 8 reps  
Dead hang: 3 sets 35 seconds

Tuesday:  
Diamond push ups: 3 sets 6-8 reps  
Dip negatives: 4 sets 5-6 reps  
Shoulder lateral raises: 3 sets 7 reps  
Calf raises: 4 sets 9 reps each calf

Thursday:  
Incline pull ups: 5 sets 8-9 reps  
Leg raises: 3 sets 12 reps

Friday:  
Side staggered squat (I almost make these look like pistol squats): 3 sets 6-8 reps each leg  
Squat hold: 3 sets 35-40 seconds  
Calf raises: 4 sets 9 reps each calf  
Push ups: 3 sets 10-12 push ups

I try to do my best on form in each these, specially making the negatives or descents slow and controlled. I usually reach failure on my last reps in my incline pull ups, bicep curls, diamond push ups, dip negatives, side staggered squats and legs raises. I do a deload every 4 or 5 weeks. As for diet I tend to do either good or fine, sometimes I don't have time to cook or get lazy and order something, but for the most part I should be good, maybe I don't target my protein goals some days. I weight 70 kg now, I'm 5'7 feet, I've been on a calorie slurpus of 2900 calories for some months now (my metabolism is insane). And so I want to share this because I want to hear people's thoughts on this. My concern is that I'm afraid I'm not making progress and I don't know why that is, I just came back from my nutriologist and after 3 months she told me my muscle mass' probably been maintained, my fat percentage did go up though, I gained 4kg and apparently all of that is fat? Honestly I don't know if I trust her on this, it's hard to tell on my own whether I'm making progress, I don't feel stronger nor weaker, my strength is something that goes up and down, I've wondered if my body isn't suited to gain muscle or even if I'm doing too much in my workouts, not allowing rest to happen.

1o62sj4,Does this sub over-emphasize strict form?,"I've been thinking about this recently, a lot of my interpretation of ""correct"" training practices come from this sub.

One of my big takeaways has always been performing movements with strict form, rather than doing whatever let's you get the weight up (yourself lol).

Well, what I've been thinking, past that first stage where your can progressively overload every session, who's going to progress faster?

The guy who stops at technical failure, or the guy who pushes that little bit harder and let's some body English or partial rom come in at the end of the set?

Past a certain point growth is just as important as technical proficiency is it not? 

I would think in most cases, unless you're still at a point where you're improving your technical proficiency for a movement or rep range, training in a way that generates more stimulus is probably better.

Like I wouldn't try doing partials with my 3rm, if I haven't really practiced 3rming, but if I've been doing 3x10 strict pull ups for a while, it seems like it'd be better to do 10,10, 10 + body english/partial reps, which those reps will eventually turn into strict reps if you keep pushing at it.

I understand that after working out, your muscles repair and grow depending on protein intake, rest, and such factors. I am just not sure if I should be afraid to work out the same muscle groups that are sore the day after working out. In high school, my anatomy teacher said the best time to work out is while you are sore, so that the microtears in your muscles tear further, and therefore even more muscle can grow into a larger tear. On the contrary, things that I have seen on the internet suggest that exercising while you are sore prevents recovery and muscle growth from happening and that I would be overworking those muscles and ruining my gains. I also have seen a lot of information saying that cardio would ruin my gains as well. I have a very high amount of energy that I get out through cardio and I feel antsy, kind of like a big dog that needs to be walked, if I don't run every day or at least walk quite a bit (\`5-ish miles give or take a few). I have seen statistics online that say that ""heavy cardio"" AKA cardio for more than 20 or so mins after lifting can ruin gains, but to me 20 minutes of cardio isn't a lot at all and none of my energy has been let out by that amount. I also had a personal trainer for weightlifting at one point who was not concerned about my cardio at all when I asked him about this, and I expressed to him that I bike, run, and walk A LOT, and he said it would not hinder my workouts, gains, or endurance. On my rest days where I am not lifting weights or doing muscle building activities, I feel afraid to run and feel like it would hinder muscle growth.

I wanted some advice on how to progress on my pull ups. After reasonable good progress I feel like I've stalled. I can jump up and do pull ups. I can do negatives.
The main trouble I'm having is achieving a clean pull up from the lowest point. I can get myself to about half way and my elbow joint is at a 120/130 degree angle. And I can clear the pull up after I'm at an angle of 75-80 degrees. But in-between it's like I have no muscle to speak of.

Which muscle should I train for power in the full range of motion? I can do pull ups with bands but I haven't seen much progress / it's been very slow progress. Would be great to have an exercise that trains the muscle I'm missing! ",1760380857.0,15,7,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1o5r4zn,I lost around 10 kgs by just skipping rope and you can too.,"So back in Covid when i had to stay at home for most of the time, i gained a lot of weight and became lazy thus never bothering to loose it and actually kept on increasing it more and more. Eventually i felt hotter than usual, sweating just from a little work and also had a huge dip in my stamina and endurance but i attributed it to me being older and not caring much. I also had a desk job and thus never really felt the need to wok out, primary reason being as i said i had become way too lazy. fast forward to 2025 and one day out of curiosity i decided to check my weight and guess what. My weight had increased by nearly 19kgs.

Thus my illusion broke and i decided to get back in shape. There were 2 problems to deal with. 

1. Deiting, as i was never going to be able to follow through with that. Rather it would just demotivate me to stop working out.
2. Time, taking out that extra time for seomthing you clearly dont want to do is hard given that you even have enough time to have the luxury of this thought in the first place

So i found a workaround, skipping rope, It was fun and i read that it burnt a hell lot of calories in a short amount of time. For 1 week i struggled to do even 100. After the 1st month i could do a 1000. My wieght by about 1 kg for that month. Then i decided to go a step further and got myself some wieghted ropes and that was definitely worth it. My skips/min decreased but my calorie burn for the same amount of time nearly doubled. Also earlier i was doing 15 mins but i decided to do 40 mins everyday with the new rope. (20 in morning and 20 in evening). 

3 months later i had lost 10 kg, no diet, just by spending 40 mins a day doing something fun. 

**Conclusion** : If a guy as lazy as me who just made excuses for like 4 years, to never work out, could do it then you can too. Honestly i can't think of a better way to loose weight that this and i hope this motivates you to workout ",1760378460.0,422,123,bodyweightfitness,fitness

I can rep out 130 kilo leg extensions for 8 reps when properly warmed up. However one problem I am currently facing is that my center of gravity is between the thighs when my hands are down to my sides. It's around 9 cm below my pelvic floor. As a result I struggle a lot when trying to get chest to bar when I am doing Gironda pullups, handstand or do pistol squats.

When I try to kick up to a handstand position to the wall mind you I simply cannot do it despite my spinal erectors being **extremely strong.** While I do have small shoulder muscles and arms, that's not the problem that causes my inability to hold a handstand.

1o53y1s,Why has the general opinion of sit ups shifted so drastically in the last few years?,"My question is basically just the title. I do majority weightlifting (bodybuilding/strength training) and have for the last 10 years or so, but I’ve been trying to incorporate more bodyweight/calisthenics for joint health and coordination, and as such recently started doing sit ups again.

When I first started working out people recommended sit ups for abs to the same degree that people recommend bench press for chest or pull ups for lats, ie. it was seen as an extremely effective, basic exercise for strength and muscle gain.

However I’ve noticed in recent years that people seem to not only recommend against it, citing it’s not “optimal” or as effective as alternatives, but some people seem to think it’s straight up counter productive or even dangerous.

I’ve seen some people express they feel it’s bad for the lower back or spine, but I haven’t really actually seen anybody offer up any evidence for that other than maybe one study done on pig spines (I think by Dr. Stewart McGill) which just doesn’t seem reasonable or logical. 

I feel they’re still a great exercise, especially for muscle gain since they have such a dynamic flexion and solid eccentric portion, and they’re also generally more approachable and accessible than say leg raises, which I also love. I’ve also seen people recommend planks as an alternative, but planks fulfill a different function in my opinion, being better for training the TVA and static strength.

1o4iwh1,RR Progress Check @ 5 weeks- No significant progress (i think..),"Hi all. Happy Sunday. Today is the end of WEEK 5. Looking back, it’s.. eh.

Perhaps it’s just me being harsh. Perhaps it’s true. Perhaps I am looking for validation. 

Me:

- 24 years old. 
- 67kg (+1kg since start).
- 5”6ft. 
- Male. 
- 2870 Calories (144g protein)

Week:

- Mon: RR
- Tuesday: Skill Day
- Wed: RR
- Thurs: Treadmill 30min jog/walk
- Fri: RR
- Sat: Skill Day
- Sun: Treadmill 30 min jog/walk

RR Day 1 Log:

- Pull ups:- CANNOT do scapula pulls. Substituted for dead hangs (Level 0 basically) with PB of 5s. 

- Squats:- Normal squats. 8 reps.

- Dips:- Support holds. PB of 25s

- Hinge:- Romanian deadlift. 8 reps. 

- Rows:- Incline. Not too low. 8 reps. 

- Pushups:- Incline. 8 reps. 

- Anti Extension:- Plank. 30 seconds. 
*i had no rings here*

- Anti Rotation:- Banded Palloff Press. 8 reps.

- Extensions:- Reverse Hypertension. 8 reps. Crunch variation.

Today:

- Pull Ups:- I still CANNOT do good form scapula pulls. I am using rings as I don’t have a pull up bar… this is not me being stingy on money but rather felt i did not need it. Perhaps this is the reason I am not progressing pull ups? 

Advice on a post I saw with a similar problem was to do deadhangs. I can now dead hang 45 seconds. Fitness FAQ suggests 5 minutes a day, everyday. Is this recommended at all within my routine? Nonetheless, slow progress I feel.

- Squats:- Bulgarian split squat. 8 reps. I don’t want to progress over yet as my legs start to shake near 3rd set. Need more strength.

- Dips: still support holds, but finally reached 60s. Very shakey near 50s so no progressing over yet. 5 weeks to do this.. not sure how I feel. 

- Hinge:- Single leg deadlift. 8 reps. I should realistically progress over but I wobble sometimes doing a rep so still requires work (I think). 

- Rows:- Still incline. 8 reps. However I have gone lower since. Probably about 4-5 positions away from reaching horizontal. Not too pleased with the slow progress or am I too harsh?

- Pushups:- Regular. 8 reps. I tend to struggle near the end of set 3  so I cannot progress over yet.

- Anti Extension:- Ab ring rollouts. 12 reps. Same height as rows. Honestly… I feel more straight in shoulders/upper body area, sometimes lower back than abs… I’ve watched a lot of form videos. I can only feel it now and again. Not sure how I feel about my progress in 5 weeks. No significant ab visuals. Only when I tense hard. 

- Anti rotation:- Banded palloffs, 12 reps. No progression above this as RR stands. I can feel core very well.

- Extensions: Still on crunch variation of reverse hypertensions. 12 reps. I should realistically progress over but the 12 reps are not done with super ease. Not overly pleased with slow progression.

Skill Days Day 1 vs Today:

- Handstand:- Wall Incline Plank 5s, 45° angle max. Today I am probably 2-3 movements away from being against the wall. 20-30s varied. Given I do this x2 a week, somewhat pleased with progression.

- L sit:- Foot supported, 10-15s max. Today I do one-leg foot supported, 20-30s max. I should realistically progress over to elevated tucks but I tens to get shaky near the 4th tome doing this. Not too pleased with progress.

- Front splits:- Reason I chose this skill as I understand general hip and let mobility is very important in calisthenics. Honestly… there’s been so little progress in this. Calf stretch, 60s easily. Straddle stance Good morning shows how bad my hip flexors are. I can probably do a 60/70° angle. I cannot reach close to the 90°. Lunge stretch… Kit Laughlin has humbled me. If I follow him step by step, I cannot do more than 10 seconds. Still can’t… Couch/Wall stretch, x3 sets of 30s no issues. Long lunge pulse, x3 sets of 10 reps no issues.

When I go to try a front split, it’s just embarrassing… Is it because I am only doing x2 skill days a week? Not pleased with this progress at all. 

Diet:

No issues really. I do not always reach the 2870 calories a day. I am looking to maintain my weight. Somehow gone over by 1kg.. Protein I prioritise reaching. I eat clean, no sweets, chocolates, fizzy drinks, junk food.

Overall:

What do you guys think? Hope you can answer / respond to the general comments I’ve scattered around this post. Am I just expecting something unrealistic after 5 weeks? Am I on track and doing fine? Or perhaps, I need to change some things? E.g. get a pull up bar..?

I understand this is a long-term game. I am not looking to see six-packs after 5 weeks. I certainly see bigger arms, shoulders and traps. Stomach still looks a bloaty… (i am skinny with a bit of a belly there and then). Legs.. i got hairy legs so its hard to see visually but I can feel bit more muscle in it. 

Mainly just looking for validation and/or criticism to help me improve.

Thank you for your time.

I do weight training 2x week but also do bodyweight pull ups at home for volume (and because they are my favourite exercise).

I can do about 15 in a row.

My question is: if I want to increase reps (would like to get to +20) and gain size (back and arms) by doing bodyweight pull ups at home to complement my weight training, what should be the ideal frequency and volume?

Mind you that I also train back and arms in my 2 weight training sessions (but no pull-ups), so I already get some volume there (just 1 back and 1 arm exercise each day).

1o3o9b2,Volume Equated - Daily Plan - Advice,"Getting back into bodyweight after focusing on running for a bit.

Being very indecisive on my program (as always) and interested if anyone has experience and opinions in any of the following patterns.

Goal: steady hypertrophy/strength - but I have always preferred daily sessions and spreading fatigue as opposed to the classic 2/3 times per week. Along the lines of what K Boges promotes on YT

All the following volume is equated over the week (assuming my maths works out)

* Option 1
   * Daily Fully Body (one exercise per push/pull/leg) per session
   * 2 sets per movement per workout
   * 12 sets per movement per week
* Option 2
   * Push Mon/Thru - Pull Tue/Thur - Legs Wed/Sat
   * 6 sets per movement per workout
   * 12 sets per movement per week

So basically - Full body 6 days a week - for only 2 sets each exercise each day

Or - do a P/P/L and 6 sets per exercise

Some other variables - late 40's - lean - doing cardio in mornings - will do these in evening.",1760163572.0,6,11,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1o338es,“Tried the ab roller for the first time — felt it in my abs… and my back??”,"So I recently started using an ab roller for the first time, and wow… I didn’t realize how hard that thing actually is. I always saw people online rolling out like it’s nothing, but once I tried it myself, my core was on fire after just a few reps. It made me wonder though — does the ab roller actually build visible abs, or is it just something that strengthens your core underneath the fat? Because obviously, everyone wants to see progress, not just feel sore.

From what I’ve heard and read, the ab roller mainly works your abs (especially the rectus abdominis), your obliques, and even your lower back and shoulders since they all help keep you stable during the movement. It definitely feels like one of those full-core exercises that activates everything at once, which is why people say it’s one of the most effective ab workouts. But at the same time, I also know that even if you build strong abs, they won’t actually show unless your body fat percentage is low enough. So that’s kinda where I’m at — I’m doing the ab roller, trying to eat cleaner, and mixing in some cardio to lose fat. Still, I’m curious how long it takes before you actually start seeing visible results from this.

Like, how long did it take for your abs to start showing when you started doing ab roller workouts regularly? I’ve heard some people say they noticed more definition after 4–6 weeks, and others say it took a few months. I know it depends on diet, genetics, and consistency, but it’d be nice to know what’s realistic. I don’t expect a six-pack overnight, but I do want to know if sticking with it really makes a difference appearance-wise or if it’s more of a strength thing.

Now, here’s the weird part — the first time I used the ab roller, I felt this kind of sharp pain in the middle of my back. Not exactly my lower back, but around the center. It didn’t last super long, but it freaked me out a bit. I’m wondering if that means I was doing the movement wrong or if it’s just because my body isn’t used to it yet. I tried to keep my form good — rolling slow, engaging my core — but I might’ve let my back arch without realizing it. I’ve seen a lot of people mention that if your core isn’t strong enough yet, your back will naturally try to take over, which can cause that pain.

So maybe I just went too far out or wasn’t tight enough through my core. I’m gonna take it slower next time, maybe do smaller rollouts and focus on keeping my abs engaged the whole time. I actually really like the exercise though — it feels intense in a good way. I just don’t want to mess up my back.

So yeah, for anyone who’s been using the ab roller for a while: how long did it take before you started seeing actual visible changes, and is that sharp back pain normal at first or a sign that my form’s off?",1760108327.0,0,18,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1) Should I do Banded pull-up negatives before doing negatives? I tried doing negatives at my last session, the first 2-3 I was able to have some control when lowering myself (less than a second tho), then the rest I had no control at all and pretty much just fell. I definitely felt that it worked the muscles properly, but I’m scared of potential joint injury and am wondering if I should do them banded until I get more control or if this is normal/fine. Or maybe if I should practice holds at the top position.

2) I feel I’m not progressing at all with my pushups and rows because by the time I get to them, those muscles are exhausted from doing the pull up and dip progressions. The first time I tried dip negatives, I could only do 4 incline pushups before I had to give up and managed to do some kneeling ones. Same thing for incline rows after first time doing negative pull-ups. Is this normal, or does this mean I am progressing too fast?

3) referring to the above last point, should I do each couplet in the same order each session (ie, pull-ups first)? Or should I switch it so that some sessions, I can be more fresh on rows and pushups.

1o07e87,"Hit a PR of 29 today at age 39, 250lbs, chasing 40 pull-ups and a 6-minute mile by 40","I’m coming up on my 40th birthday next April, and I set myself a few goals:  
\- **40 consecutive pull-ups**  
\- **6-minute mile**  
**- 100 straight push ups**

Pull up I feel pretty confident in, running is not really my thing and the training hasn't really started, just 2-3 mile runs here and there.

Basic calisthenics I’ve been training consistently for a while, with a few weeks to a month off here and there but pretty consistent for the past 5ish years. Usually mixing calisthenics, some with weight, some without, basic strength lifts, running. Today I hit a [lifetime PR of 29 pull-ups at 250 lbs bodyweight](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-usjWEPTeX2T7s9AqcukV3JxkDACKiJ2/view), which feels good, as I’m obviously not a lightweight by any means. Obviously not the cleanest at the end we count those struggle reps. I'll share a clean 30 when it happens.

I just wanted to open up this thread to share the journey and experience, share and get tips, and hopefully inspire a few others chasing their own milestones.

Here's a [quick video](https://files.fm/u/gdt6p5szp8) doing a set last week to give everyone an idea of bodytype/build/muscularity etc.  Pretty proportioned at 6'4"", but back is definitely getting kinda gnarly.  
This was a pyramid I did the other day of:  
\- **1 to 10 to 1 of BW pull ups**  
**- 1 to 10 to 1 of 95lbs OH press**  
**no rest, total of 100 each**

If anyone’s done a similar pull-up volume goal, I’d love to hear how you structured your training and the mental approach and how did you need to really lock in for.

1o064an,Is there anything wrong with letting your shoulders roll fowards in dips?,"So I can dip quite deep very comfortably. At the bottom, my front delts are almost facing backwards, rather than at the floor. I let my upper back round a lot in the position.

Any other dip form pretty much does not let me dip (except where you lean back, so you get more elbow flexion).

If I lock my upper back into depression, I don't have any pushing strength. If I lean foward, so im more horizontal, I am weak there also.

I can pretty much do maybe 2-3 reps to parallel, unless I let my shoulder dump fowards, then I can do 3x8 to almost touching the bars with my shoulders. Unsurprisingly, I have terribly weak horizontal push strength. Max push ups are close to my max dips.

I am strongest with my shoulder in significant extension. As long as I warm up, I have no discomfort dipping like this, and through dipping like this, I've gained some pretty pretty solid mobility and strength. 

I can't quite Korean dip yet, but I can statically hold the position quite comfortably.",1759814477.0,2,11,bodyweightfitness,fitness

Weak Grip

1nzp6xy,I did weighted pull ups too early (big mistake) sharing my advice for other people eager to do weighted calisthenics.,"Hi! I’ve been training at the gym for 3 months now and I’ve recently been practicing muscle ups with bands.

progress has been fast and a few days ago I hit a few reps with the the red band.

after that. I wanted to try weighted pull ups (never tried them before) to build more strength

My goal was to do a max of 3 reps and test out my one rep max.

Im at 58 kilos. I tried adding 5kg did some reps with no problem. Went up again to 10kg and it felt good and challenging while still maintaining good form.

I felt strong and excited since it seemed easy. I tried 15kg and I think it was the sweet spot. 3 reps with good form.

Then I finally tried. adding 20kg (so around 30% of my body weight)

I did single rep chin over the bar and I didn’t struggle much(I didn’t push it further than that). Decided I would end the session with that being my ORM.

went home and I felt and after getting some rest I noticed a very light pain in my wrists depending on its position and when I rotate it. After that, I noticed some clicking sounds in my left shoulder whenever I would wind it backwards. I felt weaker too.

This scared me and I immediately hopped online to see if I did any long term damage to my body.

I don’t feel any major pain but I think I might have just gotten away with some strained/irritated tendons and joints by adding too much weight too fast.

If you want to add weight to your pull ups, Definitely start with a smaller weight and build up from there and not rush it. In my case, I was excited and I thought that my muscles had enough strength and I’d be fine. 

I didn’t even think about the strength disparity and recovery time between our muscles and our tendons until now.

Add weight slowly and build up from there. Take care and stay safe everyone!

If anyone has anything like this happen to them or any advice and experience. Please feel free to share.


What I’m currently doing:
its been 3 days since, and each day I feel less pain and less shoulder clicking. going to have a deload this week and hope that my body recovers.

next attempt I’ll stick with 5kg and build up slowly.

1nzj876,44 years and 1 week old and today hit 7 pull ups!,"Been slowly working my way back into RR over last 13 weeks and today hit 7 pull ups for the first time (in my 40s!).

I have been at this number before and got stuck. However, this time I feel different. That difference has really been focusing on technique and letting the progressions do their thing -  namely the scap pulls and negatives. Next to this I noticed even when I was able to do reps I’d feel it more in shoulders - which is bad as I also have impinged shoulder on right - so I’ve been forced to lock down technique and really focus on using scap and pulling to expanded chest rather than rounding neck and shoulders in effort to get chin above bar.

My goal was 10 pull ups by Xmas and 10 second L sit. I’m 70% there now. 

Stretch goal is now reducing body weight to 96kgs from 104kgs and 12 ring push ups (currently on 6).

1nzafg5,How much should the upper traps be working?,"I’ve been thinking through this for a while now and trying different exercises to try and figure it out. It seems to me that for most movements, the upper traps should be totally quiet, while the other scapular stabilizers attaching to the ribcage are working to stabilize the scapula. 

My reasoning being that the ribcage is a large stable structure that can handle a lot of load, whereas the cervical spine is much more delicate. So the upper traps assist mainly in neck stabilization, helping support the head and c-spine. This means the upper back is working hard to stabilize loads especially when carrying, instead of the upper traps.

It seems like most people are using their upper traps to lift things, the quiet upper traps more common in the dance or posture world. What do you guys think?",1759727662.0,6,5,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1nxh6yp,In defense of assisted pull ups (with bands),"I've been browsing the subreddit on opinions between pull up negatives vs assisted pull ups using bands. Inevitably the consensus opinion is to use pull up negatives. I think the main concerns are the asymmetrical assistance (more help at the bottom) and the change in form between when you have a band on vs when without.

These are valid points and I'm not here to go against them.

But I wanted to add some a positive experience (so far) against negatives: it makes progression easier.

I have had elbow problems in the past which have flared up when making the jump from shoulder shrugs to pull up negatives. Adding a band makes that jump way easier and doesn't put the transient pressure on your tendons when you jump up and hold the position.

Now I'm making consistent gains with the thickest band from a pack, increasing in reps, working my best to keep form good. Will report back if it turns out this sets me up in a terrible position for moving from banded to regular pull ups.",1759541683.0,24,24,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1nx6gwh,Successful strategies for increasing isometric holds like dead hang? Can sub-maximal high frequency approaches like grease the groove or even fighter pull-up-like progression increase long duration dead hang or isometric lunge?,"Hi, I don't want to explain everything in length but in short: I would like to meet standards for sprinting laid out by high school track and field sprinting and jumping coach Rob Assise in this article: https://www.re-evolutionathletics.com/home/blog/implementing-extreme-isometrics

Basically:

3 minutes for:
- Standing with one leg straight and second leg balancing
- Extreme isometric lunge (or maybe wall sit or squat hold)
2 minutes for:
- Dead Hang
- Push-up hold at bottom


If you are familiar with Jay Shroeder, Dr Tommy John or Chris Korfist and others, yes... I decided to be part of the ""extreme isometrics club (or cult?)""

Why I do this:
- I want to make sure I am ready to sprint again. I started sprinting for fun few years ago but got slightly injured (foot, hip). These standards might be far too imperfect, but at least it is ""something"" based on someone with probably decent knowledge and evidence from his own team
- I am busy and this is very simple way to (hopefully) increase strength without gym, so I am stopping my weightlifting in gym now for approx. 7 weeks and I am curious myself if my lifts improve or worsen after the period.
- There is anecdotal mental strength development from these long duration iso yielding holds

I kind of hit the wall for these holding exercises now if I just try to hold the maximal hold each time and if I really push myself, I stop around at 2:00 for upper body and 2:30 for lower body but cannot improve. Rob Assise and Dr. Tommy John recommend accumulating the desired time or 5-7 minutes, so you hold until failure, then resting just for couple of breaths then again, again, etc. until hit some goal time is hit. For me this approach kind of does not work because these exercises tend to be boring physically and .entally demanding and I get fatigued and demotivated from this approach if I hit the failure multiple times for exercise while can't reach the desired time and also my wrists started hurt from the hang and push-up hold, thus I look for more structured approach which would improve the time while staying slightly below the max. time.
 
I was thinking of applying the percentages and high frequency and long rest approach from the grease the groove or using the fighter pull up progression with converting the reps x10 to seconds, e.g. my current max of the extreme iso lunge is 2:30, so following the 120s-100s-80s-60s progression first in the fashion of 12-10-8-6 reps template for the 15RM pull-ups.

I also try assisted pull ups here and there, but they still feel shaky. Sometimes I wonder if I am spreading myself too thin instead of focusing on one thing and really building a strong foundation.

That got me thinking, if you had to pick just one or maybe two bodyweight exercises that made the biggest difference for you as a beginner, what would you recommend? Push ups? Pull ups? Squats? Core work?

I say stupidly as I was only doing press ups, no complementary press exercises and after about 8 weeks my shoulder gave out. I am one of those people that tends to obsess over whatever I’m currently into. This has lead to many exercise related injuries due to not knowing when to stop / rest. I don’t want any more injuries so I’m looking for some advice on how to do this and make it sustainable. 

Firstly, I’m on day 3, I started by seeing how many press ups I could do in a row. This was 20. I then split the remaining 80 doing 10 an hour on the hour. My second day was rough. My chest and shoulders were tight and I felt weak. Every set of 10 was a struggle. When I got to my 6th set I realised my form was off so stopped there. Today I feel the same, my form is still good but I’m still tight / sore. Do I power through? Do I take a day off? 

Apologies for the jumbled mess of text. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",1759475473.0,0,11,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1nwde2d,Weighted calisthenics rep range,"Hello,

I have been into weighted calisthenics for two years or so, still I don't know what rep range is the best (for me at least). 

I've seen many people saying between four to eight reps, some others between twelve to seventeen, and I still don't know what to choose. 

For now I do between five and eight reps (3sets) and whenever I feel that I can do more than eight reps I put more weight. I'm now at 35kg for seven reps on dips and 25kg for eight reps on pull-ups. But at some point I felt pain when doing heavy dips. What do you think and what do you do personally ?

•	Least → Most reps (start easy, finish hardest), or
•	Most → Least reps (start hardest while fresh, finish easier), or
•	Some other progression you’ve found works best?

2.	For the order of variations, is it better to:
•	Do all 3 sets of one variation before moving on to the next, or
•	Rotate between variations each set (Set 1 Standard → Set 1 Diamond → Set 1 Decline, then repeat)?

I was thinking of getting a dooryway pull-up bar but I'm skeptical if they can actually support me. So can they? Can they support explosive pull-ups? If so, which ones are good? Are there other alternatives that are under $100 and don't take up as much space as a traditional home pull-up bar?

1nv3nzj,How to approach Front Lever Pull-Ups? (+ Front Lever training),"Hello,

During my main upper body workouts, I've been doing (for a few months now) some Advanced Tuck Front Lever Pull-Ups for 3 sets, around 7-9 reps. The thing is I barely touch on the first rep, then the other reps aren't touch, but well I keep trying.

So, how am I supposed to train them?

**- Keep trying to get more volume/reps, even if it's not touching?**

**- Going to an harder progression, meaning less reps (and probably no touch), like maybe Super Advanced Tuck or 1 Leg?**

**- Continue with the Advanced Tuck progression but go for less reps, trying to be as much explosive as possible to touch? (something like maybe 4-5 reps max per set)**

I have the feeling that I could continue to do my 3 sets of 7-9 reps of Advanced Tuck Front Lever Pull-ups for more weeks/months but they still wouldn't improve much (not much more reps, and I don't know about touching), so maybe I'm doing something wrong with this particular exercise or maybe it's normal...

Also, on a side note, I'm training them to improve my Front Lever, as I've read it's a good exercise to help with it, but I've also read that FL Pull-Ups should be done only after you can already hold a Front Lever for a few seconds, which is not the case for me, so maybe that's why they feel so hard and not improving much?

**So, a side question: Should I keep doing FL Pull-Ups to train for my Front Lever or should I drop them and get back to them later?** 

Currently, to train my Front Lever I do:

\- Front Lever Holds with resistance band ;

\- Front Lever Presses ;

\- And these Advanced Tuck Front Lever Pull-Ups ;

\- Weighted Pull-Ups ;

Thank you for any feedback on that.

\----------

Who am I?

I'm a 50-year-old dad of two who works in a cubicle and drives a mid-sized SUV. I am not athletic.

I'm 187 cm (6 ft. 1 in.), weigh 96 kg-97 kg (211 lbs.-214 lbs.), have a BMI of about 27 or 28, and have around 19.9%-20.1% body fat. I use an InBody machine at home and at the gym to measure myself. (I highly recommend an InBody machine to measure your body.) My jeans are a size 38 waist, the same I've been for about 30 years now.

\----------

Training Regime

I've been working out consistently for 17 weeks (3.91 months). I average more than 3x per week at the gym, somewhere around 3.5x per week, including both strength and cardio on alternate days.

I started with the C25K app to run a 5-km (3.1-mile) race, and I started using the same company's ""20 Pullups,"" ""100 Pushups,"" ""200 Squats,"" and ""200 Situps"" apps, as well. I did that for 13 weeks. I alternated one day of running/ 5K training and then one day of pullups/ pushups/ squats/ situps. I trained about 3 or 4 times per week. \[EDIT: I used large rubber bands around my knees to help with the pullups, and I did pushups on my knees. I only got \~66%-75% through those apps.\]

Yesterday (Tuesday, Sept. 30), my 5 km (3.1 miles) time was 30m 26s, with an average speed of 9.89 kph  (6.15 mph). I run my first real-world 5K on Sunday, Nov. 16, next month. I hope to get under 30 min.

In addition to cardio, in week 14 (early September) I switched to what I call the ""Kavadlo Methodology."" I've read the various books by the Kavadlo brothers. I bought Al Kavadlo's workout app, ""We're Working Out."" It cost about USD $10 and I love it. I now use the workouts in that app for my strength days.

Within the ""We're Working Out"" app, I have focused on the ""Pull-up 101"" workout. That includes: 30 sec. bar hang, 10 sec. flex hang, 1 negative pull-up, 5 Aussie pull-ups. That's it. Do that three times in a row with no breaks.

I've been doing that two or three times per week, with various running days and various other ""We're Working Out"" workouts on alternate days.

A few days ago, I read somewhere that one should ""test one's self"" every workout before training; test one's self by trying to do one chinup. Well, today I tested myself and was able to complete one chinup, pulling my elbows down, getting my chest to bar. It was remarkably fluid and smoothe, to be honest. I wasn't expecting that.

Once I can do, say, 10 chinups, I'll switch to doing pullups and proceed with the ""Kavadlo Methodology.""

When I remarkably did my chinup today, I expected to hear Handel's ""Hallelujah"" blasting out of the gym speakers upon completion. Nope. :-) In reality, no one there today even noticed\~

Thank you guys, im a skinny guy motivated and on fire, gonna start tomorrow morning no matter what. Hope you guys can help me out. Thanks again ❤️

Tldr- basically educate me about ledge pull ups (any advice, suggestions, risk involved etcetc, anything actually.)

Edit- its not a door frame. Its a proper ledge where i can stretch my fingers out fully.",1759172464.0,7,4,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1ntp0qg,Lower body workouts for volume and mass?,"

Hey,

I started training legs about 2 months back after a long term injury currently on 1 workout a week which i know is not enough but i was wondering if there are any tips and also short workouts from 20-30 minutes which i can incorporate to increase my leg muscles volume and size i am very skinny?

I am working with no weights purely bodyweight :)

My current workout for legs is this:

Superset A -

3 sets of 12 reps of bulgarian split squats each leg

3 sets of 12 reps of squats

Superset B -

3 sets of 12 reps of single leg glute bridge each leg

3 sets of 12 reps of single calf raises each leg

and 3 sets of 12 reps of toe raises seperately from superset b",1759168554.0,1,6,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1nsmuq4,Request for opinion on the volume of my program,"Hello friends!

Well, sorry, I don't think I'm the first or the last to post my program here, but I would like to have people's opinions to make sure I don't run into the wall ^^

The program below is more or less the one I have been following for 6 months (I edited it recently). 

It's not 100% body weight since I also use dumbbells for isolation (curl/lateral raise/log pull) but most of the polyarticular work is done with body weight (traction/dips/push-ups)

Where I have a big doubt is that certain muscle groups are heavily used throughout the week (example: the back with 36 sets in week B and 28 sets in week A), but I thought that in terms of body weight we could afford to do more sets (and therefore volume), am I wrong?

Clarification: I have a knee problem, I can't run. My only “cardio” session is my Leg session with little rest between each exercise. I have a morphological imbalance in my lower body (very significant thigh and buttocks) so I'm not looking at all to develop my legs, which pushes me to do a 5th session for the upper body of the week and which puts me at risk of too much volume (well, I don't know that, I'm asking, hence this post)

Finally to give you an idea of ​​my level I think that on a scale of 1 to 10 I am at 5.5 (10 being the perfect physique of the gomuscu that we see everywhere on the networks and 1 being a guy who has never worked out in the gym)

1nsmb9q,Push-up Progression,"Hello all, some advice needed. 

I’ve recently been trying to work on improving my fitness particularly through body weight exercises as they are the easiest to manage along with university life. About 6 weeks ago, I was entirely unable to do a push-up, so i went through the routines of incline push-ups etc and was able to achieve my first push-up a few weeks ago. I am now at a point where i can fairly consistently do 3 push-ups in a row, sometimes 4 even. However, it sometimes feels as if i still can’t do a single one, or do one and then fail on the second, even if i’m just starting my first set. I wanted to know how i can get past this stage, and increase the number of reps im able to do. At the moment, my daily routine is 3 sets in the morning and 3 sets at night, of however many i can do at that moment. 

Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated.

1nryzly,Added 100%bw chin-up attainable or not?,"Hey!

I used to train quite a bit when I was in my 20s. I loved weighted chin-ups (so, narrow grip, palms towards me) and I was chasing an added 100% bodyweight. Then I got some problems with depression and I have basically been away from training for... 7 years or so? Now I want to get back to training and have bought a gym card again.

When I was at my strongest I pulled bodyweight (60kg) plus about 50kg 1rm. Now I'm 35 years old and after 2 months or so of training I can do bodyweight plus 25kg. I would love to still chase the added 100%bw but part of me feels like there is no way now. Like I lost the opportunity because now I'm too old and too far behind where I used to be. And I don't even know if it was ever in the cards to begin with. I remember that at my strongest progress was very very slow and difficult.

Do you guys think it's in any way attainable now? And if it's not, how can I find the motivation to keep going? I'm so much weaker than I used to be, in every single way. It feels very bad.

1nresel,"Complete beginner here doing the Recommended Routine, but confused on the core triplet progression","Hey there, I am really confusing myself here. I have read entirely through the Recommended Routine, and everything makes sense to me except the core triplets. The first, second, and third pairs make sense to me. They all have a clear progression of exercises, allowing you to ""level up"" the better you get. There's also alternate progressions you can take once you hit a certain level, if you so choose. Makes sense to me.

But the core triplet doesn't seem that way. The ""anti extension"" progression mainly makes sense, you start out with planks and then progress to ring ab rollouts... but that's it? Then it immediately jumps into a bunch of different alternate progressions. 

So I guess the anti extension mostly makes sense to me, albeit a lot shorter than I expected. But the ""extension"" progression is confusing me too. It only has one ""progression"" before jumping into a bunch of alternate paths, and the ""progression"" is just a link to a guy talking about a single exersize. Is that the progression? Just tweaking that single exersize? 

And then the ""anti rotation"" is literally just the banded pallof press, and then jumps into the alternate progressions. Is that all?

So, I guess part of what's confusing is, am I supposed to do the alternate progressions? Because I read that as a beginner, I'm not supposed to do alternate progressions unless I know what I'm doing. I guess I am also confused because I expected the core progression to have more exersizes? I don't know, everything else in the RR is very clear and easy to follow, but the core exersizes have a totally different format and I'm getting super lost and don't feel like I'm doing much when it comes to core. 

Thanks for any help, sorry if I'm overthinking here. I just don't understand what I'm supposed to be doing about core exersizes but I really really want to get into calisthenics ",1758925405.0,23,5,bodyweightfitness,fitness

1nqpj0l,Push-up & Pull-up Training for Muscular Endurance (Not Hypertrophy or Strength),"Hey everyone,

I’m training BUD/S prep and following a Stew Smith-inspired program. My main goal is muscular endurance, not hypertrophy or raw strength — I need to be able to handle grinder sets like 100 push-ups straight, 1000 flutter kicks, or endless burpees.

From what I’ve researched (Stew Smith, r/MilitaryFitness archives, and coaches like SOF Prep Coach):

Going to failure is less effective for endurance — it mostly builds hypertrophy and burns you out.

The submax volume method (lots of sets, stopping short of failure) builds much higher capable reps.

Push-ups: Instead of 3 x 75 (failure), do 10–15 sets of 20–30.

Pull-ups: Instead of 3 x 10 max, do 8–12 sets of 5–7.

Burpees / flutter kicks: Same method — accumulate huge volume but stay fresh enough to keep form.


Several people (including Stew Smith and chat gpt) have said this approach is more efficient for building muscle stamina and prepares you better for military-style grinder PT.


Of course, there’s progression built in — if my max goes up, my working sets increase accordingly. For example, if I go from 75 push-ups in 2 minutes to 90, then my submax sets would scale up from 20–30 reps to maybe 25–35 reps per set. Same with pull-ups, burpees, flutter kicks, etc.

Just want to confirm with this community:

1. Is this indeed the correct way to build grinder-style endurance?


2. What’s the best way to progress — add reps per set, add sets, or cut down rest?


3. Anyone with BUD/S or similar prep experience — was this clearly more effective than training near failure?



Thanks in advance — just want to make sure I’m locking in the most efficient method for muscular endurance.

2. Build a well-developed warrior’s body.
   (Think David Goggins or a fictional character with realistic muscle mass & definition—not overly muscular, like Toji Fushiguro from *Jujutsu Kaisen*.)
3. Train only on rings and focus on the fundamentals.
   (As a minimalist, I believe in sticking to the 20% of exercises that give 80–90% of results. I don’t want an overly complex training plan.)

**Issues I need help with:**
I’m frustrated and wondering if my routines are good or bad.

I intended to master and progress through these moves by varying volume & changing body position:

* Pull-ups
* Push-ups
* Rows
* Dips
* Handstand Push-ups
* Squats

My main source of information and self-programming is *Overcoming Gravity* by Steven Low.

But… do I keep doing what I’m doing?
I don’t see major changes in my body—not drastic or noticeable.
I also have an inconsistent training habit. I train for weeks, then stop, then start again.

Another issue: my left arm and left lat are smaller compared to my right side. What should I do?

I added some supplemental exercises (face pulls, tricep extensions & bicep curls on rings).
Are these necessary? I don’t want to do them unless they’re essential.

Right now I’m overcome by frustration.

I also see calisthenics YouTubers contradict Steven Low’s principles.
They recommend many supplementary or isolation exercises…

But calisthenics is supposed to be mostly compound exercises.
Now I hear: *pull-ups don’t train all arm muscles,* and *rows don’t train all shoulder heads.*

Anyone, please help me out. I just want to reach my dream body.

I appreciate everyone for reading and hearing me out.",1758787908.0,15,24,bodyweightfitness,fitness
1npt6c4,Best way to train bodyweight exercises for speed?,"I'm doing some fitness tests lately, and many involve training for speed (e.g. max push-ups or sit-ups in a minute).  I've been doing bodyweight training for over a decade, but only for overall reps instead of speed. I typically just train each exercise to failure with no concern for time (3-5 sets total).

What are the best way to increase my reps within a minute? Would daily training of a minute or two at a time be better or should I stagger out my workout days? Any suggestions from anyone who has had to do anything similar would be highly appreciated.

1npq8ww,Any benefit to starting weighted pull ups now?,"Hi, 22 F, I’ve been training for a pull up for about a year with kind of improper training and I got my first pull up around April. I locked in at the start of August and increased my bodyweight pull ups from 2 to 7 since then (only about a month of proper training though as I injured myself and was ill which took me out about 3/4 weeks). I also gained about 2kg of weight since August which had been mostly muscle (both upper body but mostly lower body as I go hard on leg days), so I know I’ve made good progress, but wondering if adding weight will be of any benefit. I sometimes do a few weighted pull ups when I get bored of just doing bodyweight- best I’ve done was 1 rep for 7.5kg and two reps for 5kg. Is there any benefit of starting weighted pull ups now with the weight I can do, or should I just stick to bodyweight for now? I know that I need to watch out for injuries, but just in terms of strength improvement would it be better to stick to more reps bodyweight or add some weight to the pull ups?",1758753381.0,13,35,bodyweightfitness,fitness

I can barely do one clean pull up with my chin over the bar. 

When using resistance bands I can do a few but still find it hard for my chest to touch the bar, I just feel like I haven’t got the movement to do it. 

How can I progress with this please? 

I would really appreciate if someone could put me on a plan to progress as it’s getting a little disheartening now.

Due to a couple of injuries, I’ve been limited the last 12-18 months but I feel good now again and with 4-5 months of solid training, I’m back at my normal peak ish fitness. 

I’m making an effort this time to go beyond previous peaks and I’m wondering what other people are experiencing when it comes to reaching new heights.

1q6mjcb,How long should I build a base before incorporating workouts?,"I 22M am beginning to train for a half marathon that will take place at the end of April. I ran the Indianapolis Half Marathon (1:34) but only have ran occasionally since and even training for that I was only doing 15-20 miles a week.

But the lack of mileage absolutely killed me. I was running an average of 7:03 pace(mi)for the first 9 miles & the last 4 I dropped to 7:45-8:00 pace. 

I am planning on increasing my base mileage to maybe like 35-40 miles a week, but don’t know if I should focus on just increasing the base mileage for a couple months & maybe the last month before the race run some workouts, or if incorporating workouts while I’m increasing the mileage will be beneficial. 

Would the larger base be more beneficial than running any speed workouts?? Or should I still prioritize both while working up my mileage?

I also don’t have a plan so if anyone can help guide me to a good plan for that would be appreciated. I know a structured plan will help me, I kind of just run recovery based on how I feel for the day and run a once a week long run.",1767808822.0,33,23,running,fitness
1q6m0o5,Why do marathon training plans almost never suggest running 26 before race day? Should I avoid it?,"Currently signed up for my first marathon in October. Aiming for 4hr, but will be content just to finish. Ran a half in 2:10 yesterday (on the street, not a race) and was comfortably doing 25-30mpw last year with no real goal beyond regular exercise. I'm in my early 30s.

It seems a little crazy to me to wake up on race day having never run that distance before, despite most of the training plans I see peaking at 20 miles.

Given that I have some 40 weeks to go from comfortable half to marathon and essentially as much time per week as I need to run (my career recently collapsed and so I'm back in school and working minimally which is a huge bummer for my life but great for my running schedule), my plan was to ramp up slower than most training programs BUT hit higher mileage by peak week with at least an easy 26 if not race pace.

Is this a reasonable plan given my timeline and current level, or is doing that kind of distance ahead of the race a detriment?

Edit: Thanks everyone, lots of insightful responses. The people who pointed out that 40 weeks is enough time to essentially do 2 training blocks and that if I feel the need to run 26 before the race I should do it around May and not as a long run near peak week were very helpful, I hadn’t considered that so thank you.",1767807728.0,199,169,running,fitness

20F and about 118lbs if that helps… anyway I am on week 8/11 for training for a half marathon. Additionally, I have a personal trainer that gives me nutrition plans.

This past weekend I ran 9 miles and it was my worst run yet which could’ve been for a myriad of reasons but I’m wondering if I’m improperly fueling.

I ate a breakfast of 33 C and had 200 g of grapes during my run (100 g at 3mi and 100g at 6mi) equaling about 35 g of carbs for the whole run. I drank water throughout too at different stops.

The weekend before I ran 7.5 and it was great. Only fueling with 100g of grapes throughout my run.

After my run I was on the couch all afternoon, so tired.

I was looking online and on Reddit and I am seeing people say you need 30g of carbs for every 30 minutes that you’re running over an hour.

I turned to my trainer and he said that this is dependent on mass and not everyone needs the 30g of carbs per 30 mins.

With that, I have 10 miles this weekend and would like it to go well. How should I be fueling before, during and after my long runs and runs in general?

1q4i8fz,Why do marathon courses have to follow this rule?,"Two rules for the design of an official road running race course are that (1) any net drop in elevation from the start to finish must be less than .1% of the course distance (so, less than 42.195 metres for a marathon) and (2) the total direct distance between the start and the finish must be less than half the course distance. This means the start and finish of a marathon must be no more than 26.1 kms apart.

I understand the purpose of the first rule is to prevent courses with excessive downhill lengths, but what's the point of the second rule?

The historic origin of the marathon was a messenger having to run from Marathon to Athens. A marathon should be all about starting in one place and finishing in another, having seen some sights in between.

So why have this rule which seems so counter to the original spirit of a marathon? Why is it so important to have the start and finish points within 26k of each other?

Welcome! This community can answer your questions.

* [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq#wiki_for_beginners) the section in the FAQ for beginners (which can also apply to returning runners).  

* The two biggest pieces of advice that you will find here is to try [Couch to 5k](/r/c25k) if you've never run before and to be sure you don't [try to run each time as fast as you can](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/q15p3/you_shouldnt_be_winded/).  

* [This resource](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3TYR3d9S1s1dFpwa3E4NmZfOW8/view) is linked in the sidebar/top menu and may have some info you can use as you get started (or back into) running to give a guide on building mileage.

* [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1pe0q4p/new_to_running_or_the_sub_click_here_first/) gives an overview on the rules as well as a list and description of the subs recurring threads.  

* [This megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1o1a56f/tis_the_season_time_for_the_annual_cold_cool/) is our yearly post on tips/gear for winter running.

* Take some time to the search the sub and browse the daily Official Q&A thread and you will find plenty of tips for getting started.  

In addition, feel free to ask any questions here that you might have about getting started.   No stupid questions here...ask away.

**For you current runners:**

It’s the end of the old year and a new one coming up.  

* Did you achieve your goals/resolutions this past year?

* What did you learn in 2025?

* What goals or resolutions do you have planned for 2026?

1q0as94,Conquering Cramping,"Apologies ahead of time for the long post. Could have tagged this with ‘Training’ as well…

TLDR version is that I’ve tried a ton of things and google searched for different answers and approaches, but wondering if anyone has found a silver bullet to defeat muscle cramps in races longer than ten miles?

To get ahead of the obvious, I’ve tried salt/sodium tabs, magnesium, hot shots, goos, shot bloks, mixing big time water hydration with different levels of Gatorade or equivalent mixed in. I’ve overtrained with 16s and 18s during half marathon training and 28-30s during marathon training (I know, I know, but I had to try). I’ve also completed a 100 mile ultra with no cramping issues, though I took that MUCH slower than my normal distance race pace. So, I assume my body is capable, but I just can’t figure it out.

Some more background, and yes I’m probably going too far, but if any of you want to write my bio later 😜 - 

I’m a 42/m, 6’1”, ~185 lbs, very athletic build, who grew up playing everything and was a sprinter in grade school then moved to middle distance in high school and college. I’d always had problems going longer until I learned about changing my gait to remove heel-striking and worked hard at re-learning to run in my late 20s. Ever since then, I’ve been a distance running enthusiast (though if you want to race 80-100 meters I’m still down). I ran my first half marathon in 2010 (no cramping but slower), and my first marathon in 2011 (more mild cramping but got through it, and still my PR by a lot). I ran a new half marathon PR in the fall of 2024, but even experienced cramping around mile 11 that I ran through and it faded, but probably cost me a minute or so due to slowing down to baby it for the last two+ miles, hehe.

I’ve tried a few different types of training plans, including two-a-days, and three runs/week, and a few in-between. I have run close to a dozen half marathons and maybe eight marathons since then, all with cramping issues. I’ve more recently started hydrating and supersaturating for at least two weeks before any races and still had cramping problems. Admittedly, I was a zealot of Christopher McDougall when I changed my gait and was downing chia seed cocktails before long runs and races early on, but stopped doing that as it gives me nasty heartburn anymore. If that was my version of yak’s milk (IYKYK), then I’ll live with sticking to shorter races. However, I was considering really training hard again for a Spring half and maybe a Fall full, and wanted to see what people throw out there.

Thanks for making it this far, Happy New Year!!!",1767180141.0,25,29,running,fitness

Rules of the Road:

This is inspired by eric\_twinge's fine work in r/fitness.

Upvote either good or stupid questions. Sort questions by new so that they get some love.

To the more experienced runnitors, if something is a good question or answer, add it to the FAQ.

Post your question -- stupid or otherwise -- here to get an answer -- stupid or otherwise. Anyone can post a question and the community as a whole is invited and encouraged to provide an answer. Many questions get submitted late each week that don't get a lot of action, so if your question didn't get answered, feel free to post it again.

As always, be sure to read the FAQ first. Also, there's a handy-dandy search bar to your right, and if you didn't know, you can also use Google to search runnit by using the limiter ""site:reddit.com r/running"".

Be sure to check back often as questions get posted throughout the day. Sort comments by ""new"" to be sure the newer questions get some love as well.

I work in healthcare so I have to be at work at 6:30am. So adding running early morning is not really possible. I find it difficult to run in the evening because I was so use to running in the morning before eating anything.

|1|Finish|Yes|
|2|Take it easy|Yes|

**Conditions?**

The conditions for this race starting out a bit rough, it was a little cooler and rainy! Very rainy. I was excited to have family spectating, but the rain prevented them from being able to come out. It rained pretty heavily before start at 7:00am, then continued to go for another hour and a half or so. While it calmed down to a mist, it didn’t really quite stop until a bit later in the race. This race also started warm at about just under 60°F (16°C). The temperature creeped up as the day went on, eventually hitting its high of 75°F (24°C) around 1:00pm, luckily, I finished when it was just about 72°F (22°C). Pretty warm conditions, but the course was beautiful.

One difficult thing about these conditions is that a large portion of the course is an out and back on these boardwalk structures that go through a beautiful park. So, while absolutely beautiful, there was some slight slipping at various parts due to the type of terrain on the course.

**Race day kit**

Brooks Ghost 18, weatherized. These are amazing shoes. The weatherized really kept my feet dry through most of the race - no irritation at all and maybe just a little seep through but nothing notable. For running about 1.5 hours in the rain, my feet did not feel uncomfortable at all.

I wore teal Nike shorts, Feetures socks, my Burning Man 2025 shirt, amphipod belt with Gus, and my 50th anniversary nyc marathon visor.

Obviously some rain gear might have been beneficial, but I survived. I think I felt wet throughout.

**Training**

*Last race:* August 26, 2025 (50K)

*Total runs:* 15

*Total miles/km:* 103.79 (167K)

Training sounds better for this race than a few others in this second part of the year, but honestly it’s still not quite a lot, but my timing wasn’t terrible given the rain.

I had a long run just a week before this one so was really pushing myself with long runs in this period (NYC two weeks after this one). Most of the training runs were almost exclusively in NYC, except a few where I was in Buffalo for work.

**Race strategy**

Honestly, no strategy here. This race was a deferment from last year, and I was really ramping up the NYC Marathon, so my approach was pretty slow and easy for this one. I didn’t know what kind of run/walk strategy I would take, and honestly didn’t really think of one. I walked quite a bit and I think I attempted some longer runs then to walk, but I also just had no strategy. My mind didn’t think about it and so I just wanted to finish and not hurt myself!

**Expo and gear**

The expo was quite small! This was a nice little afternoon in Coolidge Park by the river. The organizers had tents and they were selling a few things. Pick up was quite easy and quick. Not a lot of fanfare or things to see, and the only gear I got was a sticker for 26.2 - CHA. That felt appropriate given it’s my hometown.

**Race Review**

The hallmark of this race is running over seven bridges in Chattanooga, Tennessee. This race is sponsored by the Seventh Day Adventist Church in the area, and hence the focus on seven bridges, I believe. The Church is a sponsor primarily and it had branding, but there were no visible attempts at converting anyone. I knew quite a few Seventh Day Adventors in high school as where I grew up was right by where they congregated. Fun fact: Little Debbie, the snack cake company, is Seventh Day Adventist. However, there wasn’t much in terms of Little Debbie Snack cakes at this race, nor were there any Moon Pies. Weird!

I think this course is pretty gorgeous and it is significantly better than the Chattanooga Marathon, held in March, which is more condensed in the downtown area near Erlanger Hospital, and it appears to have zero bridges.

The course had some great and clear bridges at the start, it was fun to count and try to record these - and these were obvious bridges. You start on the north side of the Tennessee River and go to the south side via the first bridge, then loop back north for the second bridge, then run through North Chattanooga till you get to the farthest east bridge, then you cross to the south side and run east along the river through this amazing park that runs nearly to the Chattanooga airport, and then you turn around and run back to downtown, where you finish across the pedestrian only bridge to finish right where you started.

The Walnut Street Bridge has been closed for repairs for some time, so it was quite nice that they opened it to allow runners across. The first three and last bridge were the most obvious and iconic bridges for this race, and so I think the other three, it was hard to understand what was a bridge. At one point you are on an elevated board walk through the trees and the park - so was that a bridge? I didn’t closely review what the bridges were and so I didn’t capture each one, but I think o have a nice video of the four main bridges.

Aid stations were pretty good through out the race, well stocked and everyone was so nice.

**Miles 1-4**

This first part was simply wet. This first part is magical for the three bridges you run - but honestly it was so dark and wet, it was hard to really see. The first bridge had a great view of the Tennessee Aquarium, and its bright lights helped us make out some of the city. The inclines for these bridges were not too bad. Once you get back to the southern side of the river, you hit mile 4 and are off east.

**Miles 4-15**

These miles are the first few spent on some greenways through East Chattanooga. Before the greenways, you run along Riverside Drive, and I was floored when I saw the Good Morning Chattanooga sign with the water company 1 this is so iconic of Chattanooga and brought back a lot of memories. Important to note, Riverside is not exactly by the river so you don’t get these views. I think this is good because (1) you aren’t traipsing the same course out and back, and (2) you get to see some cool sites in Chattanooga! The Tennessee River Greenway is the first bit of greenway you enter, and it was beautiful.

You keep going north along the river until you hit the South Chickamauga Creek Greenway, and this is a long part that takes you up a boardwalk in the trees. Unfortunately, due to the rain earlier is this race, the boardwalk was pretty slick and I had to demonstrate some careful navigating.

**Miles 15-25**

Mile 15 is essentially around the turn around point, and you just reverse through the last 9 miles - and I think while I usually don’t like out and backs, this one you just get to spend in some beautiful natural trees and woods, and so it is truly worth it.

Just past mile 23, you split from the original course to go alongside the Tennessee River - and as I reflect on the course - and it is gorgeous with downtown views coming into sight as you make the way back downtown.

The run alongside the river is really great, it’s mostly paved so no more worrying about slipping on the wood. At some point the river side path breaks up to the Bluff View Arts district, a cute area with some fancy restaurants and a great museum, and it leads over to the Walnut Street Bridge, which is exclusively for pedestrians. It has also been undergoing construction, so it was nice of them to let the runners come through for the marathon.

**Miles 25-26.2**

This final mile is run over the final bridge, and the bridge was not too bad – it is clear why it is currently closed, the boardwalk was a bit rickety and uneven, which made it a little tricky to run over. For me, this was clear nostalgia – I spent many nights on this bridge, and there is something special about returning many, many years later as a runner. There isn’t much of an incline as it kind of runs from the bluff, but then you have a descent into the north side road, and you run through the street, and make a right down into the park – with a wonderful hill that gives you quite a run into the finish.

**Post Race Experience and Meal**

The finish line was great and small – immediately handed medal, some water, some banana, and everyone was so pleasant. The rain was far gone by this point, and so it was a nice little atmosphere. My family was at the finish, which was great to see and meet up. They had a lot of food trucks around, and it was nice – we got moving as we had to check out.

Post race was biscuits and gravy and some chicken – it was delicious and a feel good recovery meal – not sure if it’s the healthiest, but when in the South, you have to have some good biscuits, gravy, and fried chicken.

1psjzqk,Are carbs actually helping here?,"When I eat a decent amount of carbs, even an amount my body is used to, my HR spikes by about 30 bpm. This is both resting HR and my HR when running. It’s always about 1-2 hours after eating and lasts for up to 4 hours. For what it’s worth, I’m 5’3” and 123 lbs. I’ve been running for 3 years, I’m 26, and average 40-50 mpw.

For example, this morning I had my usual carb breakfast before my 15 mile long run. It was two pieces of toast with PB, honey, and a banana. Nothing new, nothing different. My RHR prior to this meal was 40s-50s, which is also my usual. 2 hours later and I notice my RHR is now 80s and even walking across my kitchen spikes it to 95-105. I looked back at my Garmin data and see the same thing happening every Sunday after breakfast. I’m approaching 2.5 L of water at this point so I doubt it’s dehydration.

Looking back, I carb loaded for my first marathon in October of this year and it felt like it sabotaged the whole thing. I did 400g of carbs for 3 days before and my HR was out of control the entirety of the carb load - RHR never below 85 and even my shakeout run 2 days before the race had my HR pushing 170s at my usual easy pace. The pace I trained for ended up causing my HR to hit 190 when it never got close to this during training, so I slowed down and didn’t get anywhere close to my goal time.

**Conditions**

Horrible. Today was horrible. This was by far the coldest marathon I’ve ever run – and I did not pack everything I needed to. The weather was 28°F (-2°C), and for the Deep South, rather than getting warmer, it just got colder – due to wind chill – as the race went on. Luckily, it was a bright day, but it didn’t make us warm. The windchill at points was brutal.

**Race Day Kit**

Brooks weatherized Ghosts; Under Armour tights – leggings and shirt; Feetures mid-calf socks; Nike shorts; Staten Isle Half long sleeve shirt; 2018 NYC Marathon fleece, Craft gloves and hat; Sucio gaiter

Most of the gear was excellent. I survived. But, my hands struggled, and the New Balance fleece was not the right choice – but I survived.

The race was well-prepared with heat blankets and a nice towel at the indoor finish line.

**Training**

Last Race: November 2, 2025 (6 weeks)

Total Runs: 6

Total Miles Run: 30.39

The above stats are a joke – this is not acceptable training, but alas, life gets in the way. These weeks were intense with work as well as a vacation – to frigid Berlin. I got one run on in Berlin, but that is all I could muster given how cold it was. My trainer gave me about two weeks off after NYC, so I appreciated it, and super proud that my training somehow got me to finish faster than NYC!

**Race Strategy**

I honestly thought this one would take somewhere north of 5 hours. I knew I would be able to make at least 10 miles (10km) easily, and then I feared needing to walk the rest of the race. My longest training run was only 8 miles since NYC, and so I wasn’t quite sure how my body would do. Amazingly, it did pretty well, and I internally set a goal early on to get to 13, and then, for some reason, in planning, I didn’t THINK about run/walking – just that I would walk some 16 miles? Not sure why that didn’t come to me.

**Expo & Gear**

Pretty mighty expo for this race. It was held inside the Von Braun Center in downtown Huntsville, and had hours open on Friday – Saturday. It was a huge space, and it was well organized, with everything labeled overhead – Bib Pickup, T-Shirts, Vendors. It had a wide range of vendors, with most everyone related to health/fitness. Nothing out of the ordinary (maybe the book bus didn’t relate, maybe they had running books inside?). Fleet Feet is a big sponsor, good booth with gels available, and I was able to get about 6 gels for just above $18.

**Race Review**

I think this race is beautiful. I think this race is really well-routed to take you through some good sites of Huntsville. I think all of this because throughout the race, I was not fully able to enjoy and really had to focus on ensuring my body was warm enough to make it through this race. With a hat and gaiter up at times, it was difficult to take things in, and it was nearly impossible to use my phone as a camera – kicking myself I didn’t have my Insta360, but a good note for keeping notes in the future, especially during cold races.

So, this race was great. The expo was smooth and easy, and the race handbook (PDF emailed ahead of the race) outlined things like parking and the start (one piece of advice – add the start to the parking map for ease).

Obviously, the organizers couldn’t do anything about the weather (except have held it the day before when it was 60°F (15°C)), and despite the weather, everyone was out in full force and having fun. Aid stations were mostly well-equipped – I’m assuming they had some refills coming through, because there was at least one station that only had Gatorade, and it was running low (I was maybe exactly half in the pack – and there were nearly 6,000 people between the half and full marathons.

The course was pretty spectacular – there was only a slight section of the course that was along the same road, and I got to see the elites coming through at my time. You started east of downtown, ran a big loop back to downtown then west out to US Space Center. The first part was mainly neighborhoods – and the race designer did a nice job of incorporating some cool Huntsville things. We ran behind Eggbeater Jesus’s church, we ran through the Galaxy of Lights, US Space Center (video on insta), and a nice greenway for a bit.

The two races on Sunday were the marathon and half marathon. There was a 6:00am early start, 7:00am marathon start, and 9:00am half marathon start. After you finish the first half of the marathon, the course merges with half marathoners, and at some point you catch up to the early start folks. Whew – amazing, amazing power and energy. Some of these folks were really moving through walking and quite old, so more power to them!

The course was nearly 100% the road – and the roads were mostly good, nothing too notable, except there was one section of one neighborhood that had been re-paved within the past year, and that was smooth and amazing. Definitely some unevenness across some roads, but you can manage to find the flat part.

Volunteers were at major intersections – and traffic is still moving. There were few instances where cars were close and on the same two-lane road. Most stayed off the running route, and all major intersections had volunteers or police supporting to move cars along. They were really good, and there were no vehicular issues I experienced during the race.

There are virtually no crowds out – there were only a handful of people outside their homes, and they were great and nice. Other spectators were supporting a runner. Oddly enough, I ran into a woman who I had participated in a statewide club in high school – we said hi at the start, and made a plan to meet up over the holidays. Another notable moment was the family inside their warm home, cheering at runners.

Aid Stations were fairly plentiful, they didn’t seem predictably placed (some between, some right after the mile marker), but I think there must have been a 1.5 or 2 mile cadence. Again, some seemed to be running low at times. Aid stations all had Gatorade, most did have water, but some only Gatorade (or PowerAde?), and there were maybe three or so with Gu brand fuel options. Each aid station had portos, usually at least 2, and there was always about 2 people waiting. Note: portos on the official course are yellow and each one I stepped in had toilet paper; there were a few construction site portos and some were locked and some were not – take your own chance on those!

**Miles 1 to 13.1 (2:11:48)**

Whew, the first part was distinctly an attempt at running the whole time. I think I made it to mile 12 and did have to take a slight break. The start was just marathon runners, and it spacious enough to really enjoy the course and have your space, but not be alone. Packs of people ran a lot, and mostly everyone was running in the first half. Funny enough, the most crowded moment was right out of the start, there was a truck in the roadway, spectators on the edges, and so it made everyone build some momentum, then slow down.

This part of the race started in front of the Von Braun Center in downtown Huntsville, ran through Old Towne to start (great homes), then really a big circle goes southeast through some neighborhoods. Nice to see a mix of architecture, and there was good energy. As you

**Miles 13.1 to 20 (3:32:03)**

For this second part, I ended up doing about 3 minutes walk and 7 minute run. As you came into this part of the route, it got more crowded as you first started to see half marathon people, then many walkers who I believe started with an early start. So, the course gets a little more crowded, but it wasn’t awful and there was enough space to go around people and not feel tight. Roads sizes varied, and there was one section leading up to the US Space Center where you ran in the bike lane – and it was easy to get around groups of people by jumping onto the main road as no one was driving in this area.

You hit downtown and then head west toward the US Space Center. You start to get a view of the rockets around mile 17, and then mile 20 is fully on the US Space Center, where you get to run on the grounds and see all of the old artifacts – military vehicles, rockets, planes, etc. This was truly a hallmark moment for this race, and beautifully placed for the race. It made complete sense running under the replicator rocket as to why this race is the Rocket City Marathon.

**Miles 20 to 26.2 (4:44:13)**

Mile 20 takes you through the rest of the US Space Center, then into the Galaxy of Lights – some hills through here, and I kept up the 3-7 walk/run until about mile 22, where I walked a little more then pushed myself to do 2 minute walk / 3 minute run. It paid off and I beat 15 minutes off my time from NYC – amazingly.

This part of the course took you through a little greenway on its way back to downtown Huntsville. For the final stretch, you pass by the Huntsville Art Museum, and through their little lake of Christmas trees – what a way to end, then you swing by the Von Braun Center and those last .2 miles takes you right into the expo center and you finish, and the volunteers wrap you in a warm blanket and you get your medal.

**Post Race Experience and Meal**

Great opportunity for a photo right at the finish line. You swing out into the open, and they had a few areas set up. Volunteers handed a water bottle immediately after the finish line, and they had some granola bars, bananas laying out, and a few lines with hot food. Hot food included pretzels, grilled cheese sandwiches, chicken tenders, and a variety of soup. The center was nice and warm as well.

Immediately after, I had a sweet latte and a chicken biscuit and dipped it into some chicken sausage gravy. For dinner, I may continue to eat some fried Southern food – because why not when you are in Hunstville?

1po2zlx,Post-marathon: Training to do next?,"Hi everyone, 

I finished my first marathon this weekend in exactly 4 hours. I followed a Runna plan that was aiming for 3:45-3:55, so missed it by a bit. 

My Runna plan had me at 4 days of running. About 20-25 miles a week (average). Consisted of speed sessions, easy runs and long runs. 

Throughout the race took gels every 30-35 minutes along with hydrating at every water station (every 2 miles). Combination of some hills at the end (around mile 19-22) and cramping really derailed me from my goal. 

Rather than being upset over missed time, I want to focused on how to improve going forward and structure my training. 

I have about 10 months till my next race and want to accomplish a sub 3:20 to 3:30 if possible 

I’m looking for advice on:
- What to prioritize next in training
- Whether a 5K/10K block makes sense before another marathon build
- Strength work or other changes that help with late-race fatigue/cramping
- General lessons you wish you had applied earlier in your marathon journey

Appreciate all the insight anyone has to provide!

# Background

Me: 42-year-old male, running for 2.5 years. 193cm, 86kg.

Current PBs: 5K 19:34, 10k 40:54, HM 1:28, Marathon 3:13

I ran my first marathon in London in April, in a time of 3:31:33. I then had surgery to remove my appendix in May. Are these two things related? According to the surgeon who laughed when I asked him about, no.

I ran very easy in June/July before beginning a 20-week block for Valencia. Being my second block of the year, I could have done fewer weeks, but I wanted a slow ramp up to the race after taking basically the whole of May off. On reflection, this may have been overkill.

Post-surgery I followed sub-threshold/NSA training principles, building up to 4 easy runs a week, limited to 70% of my Max HR, and 3 sessions with sub-threshold intervals. The adaptation I made (based on common wisdom) was to put one of these sub-T sessions in my Saturday long run, so each 2h30m run had a block of faster mileage included, which I gradually increased through the block.

A note on weight: I also dropped from 100kg to 86kg over the course of the block. I did this by tracking calories and leaving a slight deficit (I stopped doing this during the last month of the block). I simply felt too heavy in London, and wanted to race lighter this time.

# Training

The mantra this block was consistent mileage. I ran over 80km for the first 16 weeks of the block (more on this below), and over 90km in 10 of those weeks. I progressed well for the first 12 weeks, running accidental PBs in almost every distance during training runs.

I also ran a few personal bests on purpose, including my first sub-20 minute 5k in 20 years, and my Half-Marathon PB in 1:28 in Cardiff, a 10 minute improvement.

The next 4 weeks everything got faster. I was so fit that my easy paces at 70% of Max HR were below 4:50/km. Instead of keeping my easy paces between 5:40-6:00/km, I sped them up to match my HR effort, and to help fit in the extra mileage I was pushing for.

This, coupled with very little in the way of strength training, laid the foundation for what came next.

By week 13 my 1km interval pace dropped to 3:56/km, and my 3km interval pace was 4:08/km, again this was at sub-T, not all out. My long runs were also incredibly consistent. I ran over 20 miles (32km) six times, which I only managed once before London Marathon. I ran over 30km on ten separate occasions. Summer really makes a difference to a marathon block.

Then the weather turned and the bottom fell out of my training plan.

At the beginning of week 15, my left achilles tendon started to feel tight and sore. Rather than let it rest, I immediately loaded the tendon with low reps of eccentric and isometric calf raises with very heavy weight.

This made the tendon feel great and meant I could run pain free or in the 1-2/10 range most days. I managed to finish week 15 & 16 (peak week, 110km) this way. 

But I was also causing myself further injury. By jumping to a heavy weight instead of gradually loading the tendon, I pissed off the achilles insertion points on the medial side of both of my heels. Nice one, dickhead.

To help it calm down I backed off the weight and began cross training every other day. I did my interval runs on the treadmill (flat is good for achilles tendinopathy), and used a Zero Runner (elliptical) for my easy runs. Running slow wasn't a problem, but anytime I got up towards goal marathon pace (4:15 or faster), the tendon immediately started to get upset.

Weeks 17 and 18 I managed to trade-off running and cross training. I considered this an early taper, trying to keep some pace work on interval days but my equivalent long runs – 2h30m on an elliptical — were all at easier efforts.

Week 19 was all cross training. Week 20, the week of the race, I cross-trained and managed 3 short runs at very easy paces without pain (shout out to EJ, my physio for the confidence boost)

After taper, my Runalyse prediction had gone from 3:01 to 3:08. My Stryd footpod had gone from 3:08 (+/- 3mins) to 3:16 (+/- 3mins).

# Pre-race

Is it sensible to run a marathon with achilles tendinopathy? No. But I was over £1000+ in the red thanks to flights, accommodation and race entry. Not to mention shoes, gels, and nutrition. I knew my fitness was good, so I got on the plane and hoped for the best.

I didn't know how long the achilles would hold up in the race, and didn't enjoy the prospect of running for 3+ hours in a lot of pain. I decided I would stop running if the pain went above a 5/10, and downgraded my sights from an unadjusted BQ (sub 3:05), to a PR (sub 3:31).

The morning of the race I woke up at 4:30am and topped off my carbs with 2 pots of instant porridge oats and a Maurten 320. I'd done a 3 day carb load at 800gm+ per day, and was feeling good about it, if a little full. Trusting that feeling, I skipped my scheduled bagel.

For London, my carb load left me overly bloated with a sensitive gut during the race, so this time I reduced my intake from 12g per kg of bodyweight to around 10g per kg. 

I prioritised rice, oats, and gluten-free pasta, along with Maurten 320s, rather than my previous approach of ""any carb counts,"" which meant relying too heavily on sugary cereals, cookies and candy.

The microwave rice pouch is a game changer, and I'd recommend it for travel when cooking options are limited.

The buses in Valencia weren't running, at least not the route myself and many others were trying to take. My friend Tom and I got an Uber instead, which would have got us to the start line in plenty of time if I hadn't left my phone in it!

Several minutes of panic ensued, trying to get a call through to the driver (thankfully Tom had booked the ride and had his number), and after three dropped calls, I managed to get through. The relief was quickly tempered by the fact he was 1km away.

I wasn't planning to do a warm up run, hoping to stay off my feet and rest the tendon as much as possible, but marathons rarely go exactly to plan. I dodged, dipped, ducked, dived, and dodged through crowds of runners and managed to retrieve my phone.

There were a very small number of portaloos available and I'm not proud of the very massive piss (in excess of two minutes, possibly approaching three) that I took against the concrete wall of a municipal building in downtown Valencia.

But needs must, and like they say after a riot, presumably: everyone else was doing it, your honour.

I walked to the poorly sign-posted corral by following the orange-coloured bibs of other runners. Upon entering the pen I saw Kofuzi warming up, and said a very quick hello. Very nice chap.

I did my warm ups, slapped on some sunscreen, downed a Precision PF 30 with caffeine, and played a few hype songs on my Airpods. Game on.

A note on the weather: much in the way water is wet, Spain be hot. And Valencia was planning on being historically hot, with forecasts in the low 20s Celsius. When I ran London it was also in the low 20s. I struggled badly in the heat that day, as did many others. I taped extra salt pills to my PF30 gels and also added sodium to my hand bottle, just in case.

Gun time was just after 8:40am and temperatures were still in the mid-teens Celsius. There was a generous and welcome breeze, and unlike in windswept Cardiff, it was strong enough to cool but not to slow.

First kilometre I went out very easy. I was wearing the same ASICS Metaspeed Sky Tokyos that I'd PR'd in in Cardiff (albeit with a new notch cut out of the heel counter to give my achilles some breathing room).

I settled into a pace around the 4:25 mark, and for the first hour I ran calm, cool and collected. This was a genuinely pleasant pace, more in line with my training paces on my long runs. If I'd been fully healthy, I would have tried to pace the first hour the exact same way.

My fuelling strategy, which was the same as Cardiff, was a gel every 20 mins, or 90g of carbs per hour. That's ten gels, and two spares. I may be 12kg lighter than I was in London, but I'm still a sizeable unit, and moving this much me that far needs proper fuel.

I also planned on taking on 500mg of salt per hour, in the form of 250mg Precision sodium pills. I've run with these taped to my gels many times over the past few years (a strategy I picked up from Eric Floberg).

This strategy worked perfectly, as I'd expected from a well-tested approach. I managed to take in all 10 gels on time, without dropping any, though I skipped out on a couple of salt tabs in the third hour, more on that later.

A note on pain: I started feeling my achilles from about 6-7km. When I say feeling it, I mean a sensation, rather that pain. It wasn't annoyed yet, but it was starting to talk to me.

# 14-28km

I hit 14km just after the hour mark, right on schedule. Still breathing easy, still running easy, but becoming slowly more aware of my achilles.

This is where, with two working legs, I would have pushed toward goal pace and stayed there for the next hour. And I tried, hitting the next two splits at 4:15/km, but thought better of it because it wasn't that day.

Around 10am, with roughly 1hr20 elapsed, I popped 2 paracetamol I'd brought with me, hoping they'd dampen the pain to come, confident that they wouldn't upset my stomach (they didn't).

10am is also when I started feeling the heat. I watched as the degrees rose each time I passed one of the digital displays lining the course. I hugged the tangent line and hoped it wouldn't be a scorcher.

I came through the half in 1:33, bang on target for the sub 3:10.

This is where the race got hard. Whether my push to 4:15 had upset my tendons, or whether there was a slight change in incline, or if the tendon had just hit its limit after an hour and a half of running, something changed.

My pace slipped by five seconds a kilometer, then ten. My left achilles was getting very sore, and the back of my right calf, which was compensating for the left, was noticeably struggling. My lungs felt fine, my HR was in the right place. I was just losing power. After moving so well for so long, everything was starting to fall apart.

It was like one of those dreams where you need to run but you can't make your body do it. I gritted my teeth and gutted it out as best I could.

I focused on what I could control. I started alternating bouts of heel striking with my usual forefoot strike to try and provide some relief. I focused on hitting my gels on time. I refilled my hand bottle with water from the course. I nursed the tangent line.

What I didn't do was put in my Airpods and hit play on my last 10km playlist. I wanted to, more than anything. But I knew if I played that card now, I'd be struggling in the last few miles once the hype wore off. I had to save it.

I was now being passed every few seconds. I kept my eyes on the road ahead, and focused on moving forward by any means necessary.

# 28-42.2km

There are surprisingly few photos of me grimacing in agony. The pain seemed to hit a five out of ten and stay there. It's sort of like getting a tattoo: A constant, gnawing pain you have to live with for hours. You learn to live with it. You chose to do it, and it sucks, but it'll be over soon and you'll have a sweet tattoo (or medal) to show for it.

As a wise man once said: Pain is temporary, chicks dig scars, glory lasts forever.

Two things happened next. At 30km, I put my Airpods in and transcended reality with a series of stone cold bangers designed to hype me, specifically, out of my damn mind. I wasn't running any faster, in fact, I was still slowing down. But damn if I didn't feel better.

Then I passed the 32km mark in 2:25. This was a significant moment, because I knew if my achilles could just hang on, I'd be in line for a PR. Not only a PR, a big one. Because if I was doing my maths right, the sub-3:15 was still on. I just had to make my legs turnover somehow.

I tried to focus on what did work. My lungs were fresh. My heart was fine. I might not have had the wheels, but I had the engine. I just had to keep moving.

Between 30-40km, I averaged 4:54/km. Slower than my low HR easy paces in training, but faster than my overall London Marathon average pace.

Then I noticed that despite my troubles, I wasn't just being passed: I was passing others. Yes, I'm I was pain, but I was moving better than those runners were. That, and the music, is what got me through.

Another saving grace was the weather. The temperature was high, but there was a much cooler air feel owing to the breeze and the amount of shade on the course. I skipped my final salt two salt tabs since I wasn't sweating manically.

The last couple of kilometres I was scanning for a mile marker, too scared to look at my watch. With the crowds lining the streets growing in number and voice, I knew we were closing in. Then a sign: 900m to go. Then 800m. Everyone picked up a step.

As we entered the City of Arts and Sciences, with the finish line in sight and Faith No More battering my eardrums, I gathered myself and closed, somehow, in a sprint.

I crossed the line in 3:13:33. An 18-minute personal best. From Out of Nowhere.

Race directors, please don't make the people who just ran a marathon walk another 5km to get to the meeting area. If you are a race director and have a good excuse for this, I'm here to tell you that you, in fact, don't.

I hobbled forward as best as I could to collect my medal. I could barely move. A moment ago I was sprinting and now every step was agony. I shed a tear from the effort. I nearly lost the contents of my stomach at the sight of Powerade. 

After I found my wife and my friend Tom (who also ran a PR – 2:44:33!), we made our way to a cafe. I drank a beer and sank an order of fries. I felt better than I had after any of my long runs. I know I have so much more in the tank, and I'm excited to see what I can do next time.

Injury or no, the time you were training towards only exists in your head. There's a much more valuable time, out there on the course, waiting to be earned.

### Background 

I am a 45-year-old man (150 lbs) with several years of casual running experience. I have run 9 half marathons and 3 full marathons over the course of the past 20 years. Now squarely in my mid-40s, I’ve decided to combat my mid-life crisis by trying to notch a few more PRs while I can.

I ran my first full marathon in NYC in November 2024 (3:26:31). I ran the REVEL White Mountains Marathon in May 2025 (3:07:39). My goal of a new PR at the 2025 Berlin Marathon was foiled by heat (finished at 3:20:15). 

Going into Phoenix, my PR in the half marathon was 1:30:35, which I claimed this summer during the best training run of my life.

This year I broke 20 minutes in the 5K and broke 40 minutes in the 10K. I decided to end my racing year in Phoenix to both seek redemption for Berlin and take crack that elusive 90-minute barrier in the half marathon. I also wanted to use the race to assess the feasibility of a sub-3:00 marathon attempt in 2026.

### Training

I followed slightly modified Pfitz 12/63 plan for this training block. I also dabbled with ChatGPT “coaching” to supplement the Pfitz plan. More on that below. 

I took a recovery week after Berlin with no running. That left 10 weeks (instead of the 12 contemplated in the Pfitz plan) to bounce back for a short-ish build toward this half marathon. I basically just started in Week 3, instead of Week 1. The plan included a bit more focus on threshold and speed work (1000m and 1200m intervals on a few occasions), and shorter long runs (peak was 16 miles). But I was over 60 miles for at least 4 weeks, which was a lot for me and actually more average weekly mileage than in my previous marathon builds. 

I trained based on an “A” goal time of 1:28:00. Here is a breakdown of the rough pacing I used as a guide during this short build based on my perceived level of fitness and goal time:

 Pace | Target Heart Rate | Minutes/Mile |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Marathon Pace | 82-88% Max HR | *7:00-7:09* |
| Half Marathon Pace | 82-90% Max HR | *6:43-6:56* |
| Lactate Threshold | 82-91% Max HR | *6:26-6:39* |
| Long Run | 75-85% Max HR | *7:46-8:29* |
| General Aerobic | 72-81% Max HR | *8:08-8:50* |
| Recovery | <76% Max HR | *>9:11* |

I paid more attention to heart rate than I have in the past. Unfortunately, with the onset of colder weather (I live in the northeast of the US) my Apple Watch became famously unreliable for this. That meant my primary metrics were pace and feel. 

I also did a better job slowing down during general aerobic and recovery runs. Probably still not as slow as many might recommend but I do think I’m trending in the right direction, trying to reserve higher intensity for speed days. That said, I did tend to infuse increased effort into long runs for which I frequently aimed for some kind of progression pacing. Because of that, my long runs were closer to 7:30-7:55/mile average. 

I did two “tune up” 10K runs that I tried to target near race pace—one 4 weeks out and one 2 weeks out. I broke 40:00 in each those, 39:35 and 39:45, respectively. Those efforts were helpful to boost confidence because I have to believe—rightly or wrongly—that I could go quicker under actual race conditions, as opposed to self-imposed “race-effort.”

The LT and interval workouts were challenging and *feel* like they helped build my fitness but I think I would prefer more half-marathon-pace work than the Pfitz plan contemplates. The only half-marathon-pace workout in the entire plan was the dress rehearsal during race week, where I did just two miles at race pace. I understand the theory that the quicker LT runs and interval sessions at 5K pace are meant to make half-marathon pace feel easier on race day. (And that certainly felt accurate for me on race day.) But without repeated half-marathon-pace workouts, I felt less accustomed to that rhythm and less confident about my ability to actually hold that theoretical pace on race day.

I tapered for approximately two weeks. As typical for me, I felt sluggish during the taper. Taper for me is also typically riddled with self-doubt. That was certainly the case again this time. Probably easier said than done, but it this is something I would like to mitigate in the future.

### Assessing Potential and Building Confidence - Pace Calculators and AI

Identifying training paces and potential for race paces are huge variables that cause me stress, confusion, and uncertainty. I use a very imprecise amalgamation of prior races, pacing calculators and charts (e.g., Pfitz, McMillan), VDOT calculators, Strava predictions, and my gut to determine what I think I am capable of for a given race at a given place and time in my life. All that is further confused by ongoing questions about what I can reasonably expect from the increasingly aging body of a masters runner. 

I also decided to add ChatGPT “coaching” into the mix. I was truly just experimenting and took much of it with a heavy grain of salt. Whenever a suggestion departed markedly from what I had already contemplated in the Pfitz plan, I stuck with Pfitz. 

What I liked:

- I was able to upload a bunch of historical data that helped lay a better foundation for who I am as a runner.

- I was able to upload data from individual workouts, which yielded some immediate feedback and a sounding board about what to make of that workout and whether it was consistent with my stated goal or if it signaled that I should consider modifications.

- I was able to plug in variations of the planned schedule to get a sense about what changes might or might not be wise.

- I *felt* like I was engaging with a coach that was invested in my training (even though, as noted below) that was far from reality. 

What I disliked:

- As has been widely reported, ChatGPT is annoyingly sycophantic. It almost always frames data or questions in the positive—suggesting that I am always doing everything right.

- It’s plans or proposals frequently change from day to day, which often required me to request clarification of the inconsistencies.

- Both of the above points made it made it very hard to give any weight to its responses to my questions or to any of its assessments about my fitness, potential, or feasibility of my goals.

My experience with the Strava Performance Predictions was similarly unsatisfying. For reasons I can’t explain, I feel invested in seeing the race prediction times fall but I’m convinced that, at least for me, they overestimate my potential at every distance. For example, in the weeks leading up to the half marathon, Strava consistently predicted 1:26:xx. Based on my performance in Phoenix, that feels pretty significantly out of reach at my current fitness level.

### Injury Prevention and Gear

Despite intentions to do more, I did only the bare minimum in terms of strength training. I was able to dodge any injuries during the block but I definitely think a lack of structured strength training remains among the most notable deficiencies in my training routine.

I train almost exclusively in the Hoka Skyward X. I have gout and hallux rigidus (stiff big toe arthritis). The stiff plate, aggressive rocker, and cushioning have helped mitigate the symptoms of those conditions. Prior to finding this trainer, I experienced recurring and sometimes debilitating pain in each of my big toes. 

I did LT workouts in the Hoka Cielo X1 and New Balance SC Elite. For intervals, I used the Nike Vaporfly 3. I raced the half marathon in the Nike Alphafly 3. 

### Race Registration 

I had a pre-planned trip to Phoenix scheduled for the weekend of December 13 so I decided to register for this race after Berlin. The cost for the half marathon was $149. For what it’s worth, they offered Black Friday registration discounts, which I missed. Might be something for locals to consider in the future if you don’t have to worry about travel or accommodations.

### Travel, Accommodations, and Pre-Race

My wife and I traveled to Phoenix on Thursday 12/11. Coming from the east coast we benefited from a two-hour time change. That made getting to bed the night before the race and waking up on race morning much more comfortable.

We attended the race expo on 12/12 at around 2:00 p.m. Pretty standard. Not very crowded. No standout swag or samples. But it was efficient and easy. I also picked up a pacing bracelet. 

I did a typical carb loading and hydration routine for the few days leading up to the race. In theory, this felt less consequential than it does for a full marathon but I still took it seriously—pasta, bread, bagels, bananas, Gatorade and water.

### Pre-Race

The race was scheduled to start at 7:15 a.m. I arrived to the staging area at 6:15 a.m. The weather was crisp—about 50F. Bag drop closed at 6:45 so I was happy that I had some old sweats to keep me warm and then toss at the start. I used the porta potties and then sipped on some Maurten 160 for about 40 minutes as I got my race shoes and kit ready to go. At about 7:05 we were directed to move toward the starting line, which was about a quarter mile or so away from the porta potties and bag drop. Made for a nice pre-race warmup jog. 

With approximately 2500 runners in the half marathon, there were no corrals or staggered start times for this one. There were pacers for 1:25 and 1:30, both of which were essentially next to one another toward the front of the crowd. The race started promptly at 7:15 a.m.

### Race

I thought the weather was excellent for a half marathon. At gun time, the sun was just starting to peek over the horizon. As the sun rose, there was also a light cloud cover that made the cool temps particularly pleasant. 

I carried a single SiS gel and took Gatorade at a single station at around mile 5-6. 

Miles 1-4

I opted to start with the 1:30 pace group. My plan was to stay with the pacer for around the first 5 miles and then evaluate whether I could trim the pace down from around 6:50-ish to 6:40-ish or quicker. 

At 3.5-4 miles I broke slightly from the pacer. I was still settling in and didn’t feel like I quite hit my rhythm but I was feeling confident that I could move a bit more freely without tethering myself to the pacer. 

Miles 5-7

I felt generally good through miles 5-7 but did have some doubts creeping in about whether I was a bit over zealous about what pace I could realistically maintain. Sensing that I was still ahead of the 90-minute pacer, I dialed back a bit and tried to get locked in without pushing further ahead.

Miles 7-10
 
I found that rhythm somewhere within mile 7 and maintained a steady state for the next couple miles. Was feeling solid and cautiously optimistic about my positioning. The pacing band indicated about a 30-second slowdown in pace due to a hill around mile 11. I wanted to respect that hill but I was also feeling skeptical about how tough it would be given my general review of the elevation profile. 

Mile 11

My skepticism was misplaced. The hill was not the craziest I’ve ever tackled by any means (approximately 100 feet in elevation) but its location at mile 11 of an otherwise flat course made it feel somewhat more daunting than it otherwise would have. My pace dipped significantly here and although it didn’t burn me out entirely, it messed with the smooth rhythm I had locked in and eliminated any chance of hitting 1:28, which was already a long shot before the hill.

Miles 12-13.1

The downhill here was also significant but it was difficult to capitalize on for a few reasons. The section was particularly clogged with slower 10K runners and walkers. That challenge was exacerbated because the downhill followed a fairly narrow and winding path which made it tough to just open up and let gravity carry me down. Finally, even if to a relatively minor extent, the gravel path offered less-than-optimal footing and traction, especially on tired legs. I was still able to get back to 6:40-ish pace here but in my mind I was banking on being 
at able to move even quicker to fully neutralize the time lost on the uphill. 

To that end, the course also included a brief out-and-back with a hairpin turnaround in the last half mile. Again, standing alone, that turnaround can’t be “blamed” for a less-than-ideal pace through the finish but I do think that all those factors taken together at this late stage of the race did contribute to at least *some* slowdown not purely attributable to fitness. 

Then it was thee end. I turned the corner and came down the final stretch fast and strong—at least according to the image in my head! I crossed the finish line consumed with that very special euphoria that fuels the desire for so many of us to keep signing up for the next race.

### Post-Race and Overall Impressions 

I recommend this one! The weather was nearly perfect, the logistics were smooth, and, even though crowds and cheering were more muted than in other races, the energy was still terrific. And the timing in December is such a nice way to wrap up a year on the roads!

Constructive criticism: The course is generally fast but in addition to the issues noted from mile 11 through the finish, there were also a few segments earlier in the race (perhaps 2-3 miles total?) that were on a loose gravel path as opposed to asphalt. It’s hard to quantify how much, if any, time is lost due to the “slippage” of a gravel path but, despite my effort to ignore it, I did notice it and it caused me some frustration—warranted or not. Likewise, several segments in the latter half of the race did feel a bit crowded with walkers who were occupying the entire width of path, which meant there was some weaving and traffic navigation that was less than ideal. I do think race organizers could mitigate some of this with some tweaks to the trajectory of the course, more strategic staggering of start times for each of the races, and some clearer guidance or regulation to keep a lane clear for passing runners throughout the course.

I did not get that reach of my “A” goal but I walk away with a new PR, breaking my prior best by nearly 2 minutes and taking third place in my age group. As I mentioned, I set 1:28 as my “A” goal for some clearer confirmation that a sub-3:00 marathon could be realistic for 2026. After Phoenix, whether that goal might be possible remains far from certain. 

I’m registered for Boston and Chicago in 2026. My current plan is to continue to build my aerobic base and focus on strength training in the build toward Boston. Based on progress during the next several months, I will decide whether to aim for sub-3:00 or moderate to something closer to 3:05.

I feel good! I am grateful for my health and my mobility. I am proud of my commitment and what I have been able to accomplish. And I am as ready as ever to continue to push toward that next PR.

Cheers to you all. See you in Boston!

1pn0kvf,How do you actually determine your ideal body weight for optimal running or marathon performance?,"I’m trying to understand this from an evidence-based and practical point of view, not just “lighter is always faster.”

Most elite marathoners are very light, but people also have different frames, muscle mass, and training histories. I often see advice like “just lose weight” or “this is your ideal race weight,” but it feels like guesswork unless there’s a clear method behind it.

My questions are:

1) How do runners actually determine their optimal weight for performance?
Is it purely trial and error, or are there objective metrics (running economy, LT pace, fatigue resistance, recovery, injury risk, etc.) that can help identify when further weight loss stops helping?

2) Is there any research or real-world data that links marathon finishing times to body weight or weight changes?
For example, estimates like “X seconds per km per kg” or documented cases of performance improving (or worsening) as weight changes.

3) For non-elite runners with larger frames or prior muscle mass, how do you know when losing weight improves marathon performance versus when it starts hurting durability and long-run performance?

I’m especially interested in:

- scientific studies (if any)

- coaching methodologies

- first-hand experiences where performance improved up to a point and then plateaued or declined

Not looking for a magic number, just a better way to measure and decide.

I also like to do a good 8-10 mile run on the weekends because I just like to.

My question is, to get the best results, is it recommended that I more or less relinquish control and just do what the plan says? Or if you were following a training plan, what would you \*not\* modify? Mileage? Intensity? Anything? Tell me your philosophy.",1765751296.0,5,13,running,fitness

My question is this how fast should you see some type of progress? 

Currently doing the couch to 5k plan and am about a month deep and genuinely have not seen any noticeable progress in cardio fitness in any way, shape, or form. Most of my runs hit about 2 miles and following the plan no matter what pace I go running my heart rate goes to zone 3. Walking drops rate right into zone 1 or 2 after 10 seconds or so. 

Contrasting with cycling. I can quite comfortably hold 9-13 mph cycling flatter trails with heart rates in the 150s.

\### Training

I (30 F) have been running consistently for about 5 years now and working with a coach for 3. My first marathon was NYC 2023, where I was slightly injured, cramped badly, hit the wall, and had a miserable finish, coming in at 4:24 while aiming for a sub-4. My second marathon was Berlin 2024, and after some training/fueling adjustments and more experience, I finished in 3:48. I felt amazing for pretty much that entire race up until about mile 24 when I started to get a little tired - I felt like I finished with some gas left in the tank, even. Based on that and how much of a negative split I had run, we knew I had more to give. However, at that time, I needed the confidence boost of knowing I could finish a marathon strong and without cramping. For CIM, we decided to take a bit more of a chance to see what I could do. Training was really similar to Berlin - 4 days of running, 2 workouts per week, and peaked at 42 miles. 3 days of indoor cycling as cross training, and strength training 3-5 times per week, depending. I made it a point to run rolling hills on all of my easy runs since the beginning of the year, as I have to go out of my way where I live to run hilly routes, and I really wanted to be as prepared as possible for the course. While I knew none of the hills were nearly as big as the ones in NYC, I was scarred from my experience of my legs blowing up and didn't want it to happen again, if I could help it. All of the hills by me are long, gradual climbs of about 100 feet or more, so I knew at least what I was training on were hills bigger than I would encounter in the race. I made it through the whole training cycle without any injury, which, for me, was already a win in itself. I did have a bit of posterior tib pain (which I have dealt with previously) about a week before the race, which threw me for a bit of a loop, but luckily it turned out to be just a ""taper"" pain as it went away after seeing my PT and arriving in Sacramento.

\### Pre-race

This was a pretty stressful taper for me, as I dealt with a number of things and also wasn't feeling my best. I had the slight pain as mentioned above, an infection in my finger, which had me on antibiotics for a week (two weeks before the race), shitty runs, and the Tuesday/Wednesday before the race, I was feeling SO exhausted and run down, but didn't really have any ""sickness"" symptoms. I know that it's typical for people to get sick/pains/have some not-so-great runs during the taper, but I didn't really have much of this for Berlin, so it was really getting to me. I was really in my head and worried that my chances of having a good race were gone, especially when I ran in Sacramento on Friday and Saturday before the race and felt like I was struggling to keep my heart rate down on the slower end of my easy pace range.

I was also second-guessing how prepared I was. Did I really practice enough downhills? Am I actually capable of doing this? Was I coming down with something earlier this week, and now it's going to come back to bite me? What if the posterior tib pain comes back and I can't finish? Sure, I had a great race in Berlin, but maybe that was just a fluke. It was almost like I had convinced myself that since my last one was nearly perfect, I was due for a bad one. I tried to push these thoughts out of my mind and remember my training and how far I had come since my first marathon. I knew deep down that I was fitter now - I just had to believe in it.

\### Race

Same fueling strategy as last time. 1 Gu and 2 salt tablets every 25 - 30 minutes. Sip on a bottle of Nuun that I brought with me and toss it at the halfway. Drink at every water station

0-5:

My coach broke the race down into a couple of sections, this being the first. It's a net downhill here, with mile 1 being a pretty sizable downhill, so I knew to be careful and not go out too fast. The plan was to be around goal pace (8:30-8:35) or even a bit slower. The first things I remembered thinking were ""I don't feel that great. I'm not sure how this is going to go"" and ""This mile does not feel as steep downhill as I anticipated"". I guess I was used to much steeper. Anyhow, I reminded myself not to trust how I feel on the first mile, and this ended up being my slowest mile of the entire race, which was probably a good thing. A couple of small climbs through the next few miles, but I was pleasantly surprised at how mild the hills were. I read probably every single race report about CIM that exists because I was nervous about the course, and some people say the hills are really challenging, while others say they barely notice them. In this section, there weren't any that stood out to me. I pulled back after being a little faster on the downhill into mile 4.

5-10:

This is the ""hardest"" section of the course, as there are a lot of rollers. Again, I didn't think the hills were anything difficult - there was one around mile 7 that was a bit noticeable, but nothing much to worry about. I really focused on even effort going up and down here, like my coach and I had discussed. I knew it was ok, if not encouraged, to be a little bit slower than goal pace in this section. Even though in the back of my mind I was worried about being too slow, I knew it would be better to try to save my legs for the end, where the course flattens out. I also think this is around where I dropped a gel, which had me panicking for a second, but luckily, I had brought 2 extras so I knew I would be ok!

10:15:

I prepared myself for what was supposed to be a ""big"" climb around 10.4 - 10.7, but again was pleasantly surprised when I barely noticed it. There was a pretty big downhill going into mile 11 and I tried to pull back while also attempting not to brake as I was really trying to focus on my form going down in order to not burn out my legs. I crossed halfway in 1:52:47, which was right in the middle of the range we were aiming for, so I knew I was in a good spot. My coach had reminded me not to get too excited here and make any crazy pace changes, even though most of the hills are behind you. I settled into the pace and tried not to think too much (yet) about the J Street bridge at mile 21.

15-20:

Around mile 16 or so is when I started to notice my legs were feeling pretty tired. I was getting worried that this meant cramping was coming, and began wondering if I went too hard on the hills. I knew there was nothing I could do now other than to try to hold on for as long as I could. I was keeping an eye on my pace, ensuring I was hovering just around goal pace and not any faster. In my last marathons, my coach paced me through mile 20 and then told me to race with whatever I had left (which, in NYC, i was unable to do, and in Berlin, I was). This time, she told me to wait until mile 22 due to the last climb (although small) around mile 21. Miles 17/18 were when I started doing the mental math, ""if I slow down to a 10-minute mile, what will my time be?"". None of the times were good enough. I wanted to do better. I seriously doubted I would be able to run any faster come mile 22 based on how my legs felt, so I was just hoping I could at least hold onto goal pace and that the J Street bridge wouldn't break me. My breathing felt fine, but all of the rolling had definitely caught up to my legs, and they were beginning to scream. I prayed that I would avoid the wall/cramping, and got more nervous as I began to approach mile 20.

21 - Finish:

Crossed mile 20. No wall. Ok, maybe I can do this. With every step, my quads began to hurt more and more. I couldn't believe my legs were still moving, let alone holding my pace. I told myself, ""If this bridge doesn't break me, I think I'll be in a good spot"". Here it comes. I slowed a bit going up, but it really wasn't bad at all. If it weren't at mile 21 of a marathon, no one would think anything of it. I was so relieved I had made it and was still holding on! I don't know what came over me come mile 22, but I was going faster. I genuinely have no idea how, and couldn't believe what I was seeing on my watch. This was much, much, MUCH deeper than I had to dig for Berlin, when I knew for certain around miles 18-20 that I'd be able to pick it up and that I would make it. The hurt had come on a lot earlier this time around. As much as my legs were begging me to stop, it was really all mental. I reminded myself it was supposed to hurt, and that this meant I was pushing to my absolute limit this time (unlike last time). I thought about how happy I was going to be with my result. Even though our plan was 3:45, I was hoping to get as close to 3:40 as possible. I knew 3:40 itself was out of the question today because I could not move any faster, but I knew I was at least going to be close. I was going to make it. I did my best to push the fear of cramping in the last mile or two out of my mind and just kept going. These felt like the longest miles of my life. All I was thinking was ""I don't have to run for a long time after this if I don't want to"" lol. By the end of mile 25, I was REALLY feeling it, breathing was becoming heavy, and I was desperate for the finish. When I crossed that finish line, I knew for sure I couldn't have taken one more step. As painful as that felt, I was also satisfied because I knew this time, I had truly emptied the tank. I was ecstatic when I saw 3:42! Based on the elapsed time splits, we planned for 3:45 on the ""slower"" end and 3:43 on the faster end. So I was absolutely thrilled with the result!

\### Post-race

I was proud of myself for being able to push through and finish strong despite the pain and the self-doubt. I was also relieved to know that IT IS TRUE, that just because you have a couple of shitty taper runs, does not mean you're going to have a bad race! Additionally, I was  happy to know that I could succeed on a course that is not just pancake flat the whole time. While CIM does have a lot of downhills, you are definitely doing a lot of climbing in the first half, even though they are small rollers. This race gave me another confidence boost and has me excited for what's to come - hopefully sub 3:40 next!

1phm83y,Lessons from a failed training cycle,"Hello there everyone! Unfortunately this post is a little long, though there is a lot of information. I'm sure many especially experienced runners here will immediately point out all the mistakes I made (really easily). This post is a warning of what not to do with training. Some people may have also seen some of my posts here or in the marathon training subreddit; I've been somewhat active in both.

I (23M; not sure if it really matters) am currently in my ""off season"" after what was essentially a disastrous 10 month training cycle. I did accomplish quite a few different things, but my main objective of training for and racing a marathon definitely fell flat. I started this cycle back in October last year. At the time, I was coming back from a hip flexor injury that I sustained after running my first full (got sub 3:20, but my training cycle was GENUINELY questionable in every way). By October, I felt good enough to resume training again, and I set my sights on the Oakland Marathon.

I followed a pretty strategic plan, especially compared to my old routine which was just yolo'ing everything. I was doing tempo runs, hill sprints, and strides, and I wasn't going psycho on my long runs (mostly...). The benefits came pretty instantly; my pace and fitness were improving like crazy. Most of my long runs were easy (maybe not as easy as they should've been), though I did have two where I went absolutely nuts in - a 13.5 mile run where I nearly broke 1:30 in the half (took breaks,  though), and at the end of my fall semester, a 17-mile all out run where I held a 7:16 pace on average despite rolling terrain (took breaks there as well). Everything was good, but during winter break  I fell sick and had to lower my intensity.

By January of this year, I also decided to switch races to the SF marathon (didn't think I'd have the time to prepare for Oakland). I also changed up my plan and decided to do speedwork since that's what my Garmin was suggesting. I was doing VO2 max/threshold workouts twice a week, and these were all generally borderline impossible. I was really forcing myself through a lot without realizing it. Along the way,  I decided to sign up for a half in March to see if I could break 1:30, which I did (1:27:42). I took a little less than a week off, and threw myself back into training.

I was at first doing somewhat fine,, but I think by April I definitely started to fall off. I was blowing up bad ont he same routes that I was initially handling well. Sleep was also an issue, though I know that I didn't have the best habits before bed (screens right up till bedtime). I once had a really bad heart rate spike during a threshold session, and that spooked me enough to take around 2 weeks off (I got it properly checked; I was fine). However, I still pushed ahead. By May, graduation happened, and as part of that, I went for the same psycho 17-miler I did last time. I was a little slower, and I was struggling a lot more. I fell sick shortly afterwards, so I had to rest up for a bit.

By the end of May, I started to make a comeback, and this included pacing a half. I kept it easy and had a genuine blast, but throughout the race my left Achilles tendon was feeling ""compressed"" (best way to describe it; it wasn't supporting my weight that well). I got this checked with a PT, and I got help for it. I took 4 weeks off, called off SF (hated that decision), and switched over the same race I did a year ago - Santa Rosa.

4 weeks post-injury, I was cleared to get back to running, and I decided that I would work on desperately clawing back all the fitness I had so I could just complete a marathon and get that closure. Forget any time goals. I did get help from some kind stranger here in how I should reorganize my training routine, but I badly overestimated my capacity and recovery needs. Things seemed fine, though I was struggling with inclines and just didn't feel great, but around 4 weeks in I tripped and fell (I've had an issue with tripping and falling). The abrasions were pretty bad, and I was having some knee pain, but I took a day off before continuing with the routine. My last long run was an 18-miler with lots of hills, including some crazy steep ones. It was a huge struggle, but I made it, and I suffered the consequences. The following week I could barely run or walk, and I had to take NSAIDS and apply ice, and just rest.

As a result of this mess, I decided to drop down to the half. I took time off from running, and I slowly just trained for it. Ultimately, I was able to handle it fairly well. I didn't have much pain at all, though the blow up was an issue. I still got a little below 1:50, and I was having a blast the entire time (note: I was not all-out racing it. I don't know what I would've gotten had I gone all-out. This felt more like a training run that just so happened to be a big party more than anything else).

Now, I'm currently in my off season, and I'm just picking up the pieces from it. I was able to still run a fair amount every now and then (managed to pace another half and even run a casual 10K pretty comfortably ), but my body still has some issues that I'm working on fixing. I'm recovering from another bout of Achilles tendonitis with my right ankle; I can run with mild discomfort at most, and for the most part I'm doing so much better. I've also been working with a personal trainer to get myself fixed up and build better habits.

I think there are some key lessons I learned from this absolute mess of a cycle:

1. Don’t be afraid to back out. In hindsight, I should’ve noticed the warning signs like all the blow ups in April; that was enough of a sign for me to step back and try again another time.
2. Don’t neglect strength training. I definitely didn’t do enough lower body strengthening, and that got me.
3. Recovery is essential. I can run 6 days a week, but it’s not worth if it I’m not getting enough sleep, if I’m not stretching especially after my runs, and if I don’t have enough weeks where I ease off. 
4. Don’t get emotionally attached to any event. FOMO is too strong. There’s always another event around the corner I can go for. 
5. Be reasonable with expectations. All these borderline unsustainable workouts certainly wrecked me. I don’t think anyone save an elite runner can do those properly. ",1765223232.0,53,26,running,fitness

1phe3bp,Non-shill Sole F85 Review - pure disappointment,"F85 body feels sturdy but that's all it has. Takes ages to get started, even from stand-by, takes like over half a minute just to load. Everything software related is inconsistent AF.

The large screen is useless except for basic stats, but then you don't need the screen at all. If you attempt to touch the screen from walking, you will find your feet stepping onto the front plastic. It's the same with holding onto the front handrail, feet keep hitting the front plastic because the whole upright is too far forward.

Manually measuring the HR is bad, they might as well not even include this on the handrail, it's laughable - it shows some wild HR figure.

Most of the apps are too slow (some weak Android garbage), bad design, and when I asked Sole to add Plex app they said no. Support advised me to screencast, which is utter crap since it keeps failing and disconnecting. I'm using iPhone 16 Pro Max, just can't get it to work for more than a few minutes at a time. The app for that has a menu on the side, it keeps changing location on the screen, it can't remember preference for a setting to either show or hide the menu.

I'm not going to dwell on how ugly this thing looks in real life, has gigantic Sole lettering written all over it - it's basically made to look like a commercial treadmill, but it isn't one.

In order to see HR from my Apple Watch I have to turn on the Sole app on the watch, which has to stay on. Then I can see HR on the screen only sometimes. This makes it like I can’t even use my iPhone for streaming then. I need another device. It’s all pretty messed up. 

For multiple users, if you log in as one user you will find that apps are not treated separately per user, so even though you have a pin, other users will be able to see you still logged in inside various apps. In other words, forget about privacy, you will need to switch user for various aspects of the app.

The speakers are pure garbage, and because it’s some crappy old Android - good luck connecting your AirPods if you try to screen cast -or even worse, switching devices.

The fans are basically some tiny computer fans, loud and blowing not sure where - not at me for sure.

Quick question I would label my self as a beginner runner. I’m not a complete beginner I ran xc/track in high school and just have been running out doors off and on for years never been consistent much but can run a 5k in 30m and a 10k in 1hr. 

Recently I’ve been more committed to running actually kind of falling in love with it because mental benefits and weight loss. I’m currently following a beginner training plan for getting faster at 5k through the Runna app but last week I started running on some of my off days. The app has me running 3 days a week but I would like to run maybe 4or 5 days. I don’t want to burn out or impede on train progression.

1pg8u29,"If someone cares about getting faster but not their actual time, does getting better shoes for speed work matter?","I realize this question might be phrased in a confusing way, so I'll try to clarify.

Let's assume a runner wants to improve their performance and is not limited by time or budget to meet that end. They follow a proven plan and have the endurance and physicality to perform all forms of training to include interval, tempo runs, and speed runs. However, they run relatively slowly and have no ego about their actual time.

If this is the case, will their training - particularly speed work - be impacted by having shoes optimized towards speed work? I am specifically asking in terms of the runner's baseline running performance, and NOT improvement in time.

I'm aware that if a runner decided to switch from some Vans to some Vaporflys, they'd instantly run faster. That's not quite what I'm talking about. Rather, if they are doing all their workouts on a beat-up pair of Cliftons with 1,000 miles on them, is the inherent value of their speed work diminished because they have to work more inefficiently on degraded foam? I'm sure that either way, the runner will see improvements, but I'm hoping to spark discussion on what is optimal from a training perspective.

Hopefully this made sense! Appreciate everyone's thoughts.",1765080221.0,99,58,running,fitness

I've ran a couple of marathons before while doing some strength training/running on my own, but I wasn't sleeping or eating properly. I want to run an ultra and would like to train better this time. This PT's sessions are $145/session, which is steep but justifiable. I have never had a personal trainer before, so I don't know what the price point is or how to know if it is worth it ***for me***. I am not sure if other gyms (LA Fitness, Fitness Formula Club, or the Athletic Clubs, as I'm in Chicago) will have similarly skilled trainers (at FFC, monthly rates for trainers start at $99, but I haven't spoken to any of the trainers). 

  
I did learn a lot from my session with the PT at Equinox- to be more mindful with my strength training and breathing- and he will also work with me to improve my sleep (which is bad) and nutrition. He was able to tell from watching me run/walk that I needed to fix some things, and was able to judge how physically fit I was from a couple of strength exercises.

The mods do their best to actively moderate this community. When posting, we expect users to make an effort to familiarize themselves with our rules and practices before submitting posts or comments. We suggest taking note of **Rule 2** *and* **Rule 7**, *since these are the most commonly broken which will result in a thread being removed.*

The mod team has tried to lay out the rules with some expected guidelines of what is or is not allowed, but there is always some gray area and posts are up to interpretation by the mod team.  We do our best to be consistent, but that isn’t always the case with multiple mods or even the same mod between similar posts.  The mod team wants to make /r/running a resource for new and experienced runners and to build a community between all types of runners.

Regardless of that fact, Moderators have the final say.  We are open to hearing differing opinions, but the mod team will make the final decision.  Visitors and posters in /r/running are expected to understand that the mod team are people too and doing the best they can to manage a very large sub with frequent posts every day.  If you do not agree with how this sub is moderated, we expect you to do so in a civil manner….and also know when it is time to drop it.

We are very upfront in stating that the sub is heavily moderated, but we do recognize that not every user wants that.

###**Rules**
We have further [explanations of the rules in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_rules), but as noted in the side bar, please take note of Rule 2 and Rule 7 as they are the ones most cited for post removals.

 **(2)** - *Posts need to generate discussion and/or useful information that other searchers can then benefit from. Low-quality posts, recent reposts, chronically repetitive posts, posts not directly related to running, and questions that are easily answered by FAQ, searching r/running, or Google are subject to removal at the moderation team's discretion.*  

This sub attracts a lot of beginners as well as “drive-by” posting.  A major goal of the sub is to promote quality discussion and develop a community where information and experiences can be shared.  Many of the common questions have been answered, either in previous threads/FAQ, or could easily be answered in the daily Q&A thread.  Yes, circumstances can vary person to person, but it is expected that posters make an attempt to find these answers for themselves before making a stand-alone post.   Visitors should put forth some effort in finding the answer themselves and not expect the Runnit community to do all the work for them.  If the post/question is very specific to your situation (such that other general user won't get much benefit from the information), then it belongs in the daily Q&A thread.

If you do make a stand-alone post, please include info relevant for the community to help.  It is nearly impossible to offer any advice without sufficient background information.  Items that could be relevant:

* Age

* Sex

* Current MPW + pace

* Previous peak MPW

* Workouts you traditionally or recently have completed

* Goals (including specific races)

* Previous PRs

* Other things you think might be helpful to include

Below are some of the reason a post would be considered low-quality, thus being removed and directed to the Daily Q&A thread:

* ""Does anyone else..."" type posts?

* ""Is X a good time for...?"" posts

* If your post is a question in the title (including “See title” or “Title says it all” in the body).

* If your question can be asked in one sentence.

* If your question is very specific to you or your situation.

* If your question can be answered either with a yes/no.

* In general, it is helpful to include something that shows you made an effort to find an answer within the community and thus separate it from the numerous low-effort posts that are submitted every day.  

* Additionally, as rule 5 states, make your title descriptive.  If it is not clear what the post is about or asking, then it will not be useful in later searches.

Finally, while mutual encouragement and sharing of information is a very high priority of r/running, numerous motivational-type and PSA posts are not necessary.  A larger goal of the sub is to provide information to runners, beginners and experienced, which can get drowned out by these types of posts.


 **(7)** - *Do not solicit medical advice. This includes 'Has anyone else experienced this injury?' type posts.*  

While there is some leeway on advice for rehabbing some minor, common running injuries, this sub is not the place for a diagnosis, and especially not for advice on major injuries.  If you are hurt or injured, find a medical professional with the proper credentials to help you.  Not the internet.  

There is a big difference between ""Hey, my IT band is tight. Got any good stretches for it?"" and ""My shins hurt every time I run. If I run through the pain, will it turn into a stress fracture?"" If your question involves sharp pains, unknown/vague pains, or injuries/problems that have stretched on for long periods of time, then it is a question for medical professional.

Also, your doctor not being familiar with running injuries is no excuse.  Find a Sports Medicine doctor, Physical Therapist, or find another doctor.

Finally, feel free to use this post to offer any ideas or suggestions of things you'd like to see (or not see) here.  We are open to feedback, but please be civil, constructive, and willing to have a discussion.  This is not the place to rant.

1pcbzmz,Streakers. Lend me your tales.,"Interested to hear of stories from streakers (of the running kind). To see how they compare with my own story/experiences. 

Almost 6 years ago I got up on January 1st and thought to myself. I wonder if could run at least 5km every day for 366 days (leap year). It wasn't easy but I did it. The first 3 months were the hardest. Then when I got to the last run it was great, but the next day.. what do i do now? Ah well, might as well go for a run until i figure this out. I came to the conclusion on that 367th run that 367 was a silly number to stop on. 400 was a nice round number. Of course on run 400 it became clear that 500 was a much better number. At 500 it was almost 2 years and at 2 years it wasn't all that far from 1000 days. At 1000 days you say well way not 2000 days. So, you can obviously see where this is going. Today will be 2163 days of ""at least 5km a day"" and at the end of this month will be 6 years. 

  
What has it taught me?

Even on the worst days. I always feel better at the end of the run. 

Mental health: A few years ago my wife contracted stage 4 Metastatic Melanoma. She's ok now. ""NED"" - No evidence of disease. But those were 3+ really tough years where we learnt a lot about cancer, grief, about how to really deal with emotions and bad news. And we learnt a lot about each other. Stage 4 cancer during COVID really is no joke. Running was the only part of the day where I could be selfish. Where I could really be with my own thoughts. This helped me no end. And i think it helped her. She said a few times that watching me pull my gear on and head out, on dark nights, cold days, heavy etc. Inspired her that sometimes we can go and do something difficult even if we really don't want to. (she also learnt just how stubborn i can actually be)

Injuries: I have had several along the way. But luckily none that might be a show stopper. I had Planter Fasciitis for about 6 months in my right foot when i tried to make a pair of Salomon Speedcross last a whole year. Spoiler, they couldn't. I also injured my calf in the first few months of the streak when i took cramp a few 100m from home, i was on for a good time so i kept going. This was a mistake. I've also had several bouts with Achilles Tendonitis. What i have learnt is that rest doesn't always necessarily mean stop. To simply slow my pace to around 33-36minutes for a 5km. It is enough for me at least, to allow the legs to heal themselves and I can run through it. (HA! Suck it Mr Doctor)

Pace: Too fast is no good. I cant go flat out every day. I have to remind myself of this. If i go too fast i cant go every day. I had to start listening to Podcasts instead of music as they kept my speed down. Music just had me accelerating towards PB pace. I have found that the sweet spot is around 27-28 minutes. Not too fast, yet fast enough to continue perpetually. Sometimes i will start a run and the legs feel great, they will tell me when i can go for a fast time. I cant plan for a fast time. 

Distance: ""at least 5km a day"". I have on occasion when feeling particularly good, healthy or cocky. Gone a bit further.  During 2023 i decided to run my years worth of days for a local cancer charity in Glasgow Scotland, and I actually somehow raised around **£**24000. So on the last day of the challenge i ran from hour house to the cancer charity, just to mark it being the last day. That day was almost bang on marathon distance. The next few days 5km runs were hell. I occasionally do a 7, 8 or 10km run. Now and then I like to go hill running in the Scottish highlands with the dog/s. But distance is as important as pace. I have to be careful of both in order to continue long term. Have to be very aware of my legs feelings at all times.

The number. The number is an obsession. Its not about the distance I have covered in those years. Its about the number that eternally ticks up. People ask when I will stop. I used to have an answer to that. After one year. Oh maybe 500 days. 2 years. But now I simply say I don't know. Because I have become a slave to that number. Say there's one really bad day and I don't go running, it would stop it all. But then its over over. The further I go, the longer it would take to get back to the same place. So... just get up and go for a run.      ",1764690759.0,319,208,running,fitness

### Before we start 
Bit of a preamble but, in my opinion, necessary to fully appreciate the story of my first marathon (or I just like telling/knowing the full picture 😁)

The journey began in 2023 when I was supposed to run this very same marathon for my first. I was following JD 2Q and everything was going great until 2 months out when I had an ITBS injury. I was unable to run more than 3-4km at a time for weeks and threw in the towel a month out, selling my bib to someone desperately wanting one (via official methods). 

On the plus side, 2 weeks later I learned I was going to be a dad . Between the ITBS and getting ready to & then being a new dad ... I didn't do much running first half of 2024.  But I did strength train my glutes and went to see a specialist in orthopedics.  When I started running again in June/July, no more pain. 

I did a small race or two by the end of 2024 (10k and a short trail race) and sought another first marathon first week of May of this year. 

Training went iffy with a baby, mainly because I got sick every 4-6 weeks and couldn't get a good rhythm in. Then my dad unexpectedly passed last week of April... that was that.

I was starting to feel a bit cursed , maybe a marathon wasn't meant to be. But , again in June/July, I got the small seed in my head once more and thought it was best to jump right back in... if I put it off again I was afraid how long I'd put it off for. So I decided to sign up for the same fall marathon I didn't run in 2023 and get some revenge. Problem: it was sold out. After a few weeks of looking (all the while optimistically starting my training plan), I managed to find one. Like me two years ago, I bought one off of someone who got injured 2-ish months before. 

In August I learned I was going to be a dad yet again, and I felt confident my choice of marathon in November of this year was the right one.

### Training 
I decided to take a bit of what I learned from 2Q and improvise. Basically I did 2 quality sessions a week: intervals/speed work midweek and mostly MP long runs on the weekend. I averaged 70km a week, and topped at 85ish. 

The first time around, I was aiming for 3:55-4:00. This time I felt good and, after a month or two of starting the training block, I confidently set my goal at 3:45 (5:20mn/km pace).

Everything went great , almost suspiciously so. I bought a pair of Puma DNE3 for the marathon, tried them out on a 30k long run a month out and all was good. Then 3 weeks out I had one of my worst long runs of the block in terms of paces , but it was also my longest at 33km. 

And 2 weeks out I tested the DNE3 yet again on a 26-27km LR, but got a pain on top of my big toe that got worse as the run went on, maybe a nerve or tendon. Managed to finish , but all my runs after that were never completely pain free , and I certainly couldn't wear the DNE3 again (though I tried).

5 days out from the marathon, I bought a new pair of shoes for the race : Adios Pro 4.  I did 3 short runs in 4 days with them and decided to risk using a completely unknown value on long runs.

### Pre-race
La Rochelle is a beautiful seaside city on the west coast of France (north of Bordeaux, south of Brittany) with its famous ""Vieux Port"" (old port). Unfortunately, we didn't get to experience much when we arrived Saturday pre-race as it was as grey and rainy as they come. My weather app called for nothing but clear skies on race day Sunday, but it was hard to envision the day before. 

I go get my bib while my partner checks into the hotel , I have a quick stroll through the marathon village, and then join them for a calm night (it's already 6pm by then). We eat , play with our 18-month old , put him to bed, and it's already past 8. 

I do a final check of next morning's gear and oh no oh no oh no ... I forgot my running socks. I'm the world's biggest idiot, I can clearly see where I left them at home... the exact shelf...

Well it's nearly a 4hr drive so going back was out of the question. The marathon village just closed... I tried calling and sending a few messages to see if any of the vendors could help me out but got nothing. And as a last resort I left a message on a FB group for the marathon but still nothing. 

All I had were a pair of regular cotton socks and I was panicking. I tried to calm myself before sleep by reassuring myself I had antifriction cream and some NipEaze bandaids I bought and never used for my nips in case the cream wasn't enough. That was that, time for sleep 

I woke up at half four, unable to sleep a second longer. Checked my phone, and a woman from the FB group answered my post offering a pair of running socks JUST under my size (size 42 Europe for my size 43). I wasted no time answering her yes, better running socks a tad smaller than cotton ones. 

Got my breakfast, got dressed, and went to meet her in her corral before joining mine. My FB post clearly asked to BUY socks from someone but this lovely person, Sophie, wouldn't hear it and didn't want anything in return. 

Between my injury in the last two weeks, the risk of having to run in a pair of shoes I'd never tested past 6km, the horrible weather on the Saturday, and the sock situation... I was seriously beginning to think the curse would strike again. Sophie and her act of kindness was the beginning of things flipping towards positivity. 

I joined my corral and the sun was just starting to rise. Barely any clouds in the sky. And the socks fit me great, in the end.

### Race
BOOM! Off we go. My 3h45 plan meant sticking to 5:20/km pace , but with 8000-9000 runners that was impossible the first two kilometers. After 3-4, there was no wide open boulevard but at least it was starting to get easier moving about people and hitting my paces. And in fact after km 2 I was always closer to 5:10. At first it was to try and get back a bit of lost time, but then I just felt good.

The La Rochelle marathon is a two-loop course, so the first time around it was a bit discouraging to see km markers for the current km and for one about 20km after.

The course itself however was great, crowds everywhere cheering you on and the city is beautiful. Some people complained about slight uphills but I thought it was fine and a fast course. 

I was a bit bummed because I was looking for my significant other, my teenage stepson, and my 18month old for the entire first half. I thought I must have missed them but I know the little one sometimes gets up late or takes a bit to eat his breakfast etc, and I'd most likely see them later.

Things were very easy arriving at the halfway mark. I managed 1:52:26 which was 5:15 pace, though I had no idea at the time because I knew my watch was off by a few hundred meters. But I knew I was going faster than planned, and my watch told me my average pace was under 5:15. I kept telling myself I was going too fast and to go back to 5:20 pace but people kept getting in my way then and I just naturally fell into a faster pace and went faster as the race went on. 

At km 23 I finally saw my family cheering me on. That's one of the moments that'll stay with me. 

Around km 26-27 I still felt great. In training, this was when I would begin to lose my wheels. Not here. I saw an ""estimated time"" sign saying 3:46, but I knew that was wrong and only official scratch time, not real time. But I had no idea what pace I was actually on for. All I wanted was 3h45, I felt great so I thought I might as well kick on and see what I could give. We only live our first marathons once. 

Km 29, 30, 31... Came and went. I kept fearing the wall, not knowing when it would hit. I had my flask of water, I had my gel every 30mn... I kept feeling good.

Km 32, 33...34... Here we go, I've never ran this far before. The crowd was incredible the entire course, kids asking for high fives and Super Mario mushroom signs asking to be hit for a speed boost... I obliged time and time again. Bands playing cover songs, I'd give a wave to every one and sometimes even sing some. 

35, 36, 37... Unless catastrophe hit, I now knew I was going to finish. How strongly was the only question. People kept shouting my name from my bib, I kept answering thanks while people around me were struggling to even comprehend that someone was saying their name. 

38 39 40. The entire second half of the course people were starting to look tired , and loads were starting to walk after the 25km point. But now people were pulling up with cramps, injuries, and general loss of juice. And still no wall for me... I still had legs.

41 ... The crowds were roaring us on. The energy return was unbelievable. 

The finish line is on the Old Port. You hit 42km and you're on cobblestones for 50m. Then you turn onto a nice flat surface with a blue mat for the final 100m. Turning into that final stretch, I still felt pretty good. Everyone around me looked completely shattered. Nobody was sprinting it in?!?! Come on!  

The cobblestones end, 100m left and the finish line is there. I went all out. Zach Miller, here's thinking of you !

I'd be interested to see my positioning in the rankings by each km marker because I know I passed way more people than I got passed. The final 10km alone I passed literally hundreds. And that last 100m stretch I passed at least 50 I'd wager. 

42,2... There is no curse.  Just a beautiful beautiful day. And my first marathon in the books. 

### Post-race
I went to rejoin my family and it was a bit of work finding them and it took me a good 10-15 minutes. As soon as I saw my partner, she kissed and hugged me and said ""you must be so excited, 3:39!!""

What?! In the rush of things at the end, I didn't even see the clock announcing my time (or the official scratch time). I had a good feeling I was under 3:45 but it didn't even cross my mind I'd be sub 3:40. 

We stayed a bit to cheer on other runners. Most looked rough, some looked like they were loving it. 

I had written a few things on my wrist... My dad, my son, my next one on the way... in case I needed reminding of the important stuff when things got hard. Turns out they never did. 

I got a bruised toe that I'm pretty sure I'll lose in the process, and the pain I had on top of my big toe (the other one) got a bit worse but I'll manage. Everything else is fine, just a bit sore here and there. 

On the car ride home, my head was reliving the day and already half thinking of what comes next. Well first I'll anxiously await baby #2. And 2 young'uns at home will be a marathon in itself !

But I know I can push harder, and there's plenty of room for a PB. :) 

Thanks to anyone who read all of that !

1pbooqp,Comparing ChatGPT with established training programs - analysis and race result,"The clickbait title for this post would have been ""How ChatGPT coached me to my best ever 10k!"" but that would no doubt have violated group guidelines. Hopefully this is a worthwhile read and generates some discussion.

**TL;DR**

I recently used ChatGPT to create a 6-week 10k training plan. Rather than blindly trust the result I compared it with several other established training programs to see if it made sense. For the most part, it did. I then executed the plan as programmed and did the race, which went well and I hit my goals solidly. With clear guidance, ChatGPT can be a useful training tool.

**ChatGPT prompting and generated training plan**

I told ChatGPT I was 57, male, and had recently completed a triathlon that I trained for consistently if not intensely - 16 week program, 2 runs per week about 15-20 km total, 2 bike rides per week 40-100 km, 1 swim 1-2000 m, 3 weightlifting sessions per week (but not in weeks 8-15 because I was out of town). The triathlon was a standard distance (1500m swim, 40k bike, 10k run) but the run was a little short - I ran the flat, 9.4 km course at a pace of 5:01/km.

I prompted ChatGPT for a 6 week program with 2-3 runs per week, cross-training on bicycle and rowing machine, and 3 days per week of lifting weights. I said my goal time was 50 minutes, with aspirations for 47. Granted I could no doubt have run 50 off my triathlon training. The full plan prescribed by ChatGPT is outlined below. Basically two main runs per week - one set of intervals (\~5k pace) or tempo (\~10k pace), the other long-ish and fast-ish - with an optional third easy run. Plus cross-training (1-2x weekly cycling or rowing machine) and strength training (3x weekly weights).

**Hal Higdon comparison**

Looking at [Hal Higdon 10k intermediate training](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/10k-training/intermediate-10k/), he says an intermediate runner ""should be running five to six times a week, averaging 15-25 miles weekly training (24-40 km)"", which is a fair bit more than I've been doing. The program is an 8-week program with alternating tempo run and 400 m intervals, very similar to the ChatGPT plan. The Higdon plan has a long(er) run on the weekend at ""conversational pace"", compared to ChatGPT plan with long runs a little faster than conversational. And Higdon has three additional easy runs per week, vs. ChatGPT with one optional easy run (per my directions). So all-in-all very similar, given what I asked for in my prompt. I wonder how heavily Higdon's publicly available plans figure in ChatGPT's training data?

r/running **Intermediate plan comparison**

The [10k Running Plan - Intermediate](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mN1wN_iXP7dbVKMS_vUsgj-KqbGxovkM/edit?gid=892614299#gid=892614299) linked from reddit is an 8 week plan with 6 runs per week. Two of the runs are ""workouts"" with a mix of short and long intervals and tempo runs. One long(er) run per week and 3 easy runs, with strides or hills following 1 or 2 of the easy runs each week. More complex than Hal Higdon or ChatGPT, but a similar pattern of mixing hard runs, long runs, and easy volume. The [Beginner](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pdj2akrs-DrVGMwzK8m4se995HacT8Kj/edit?gid=859294115#gid=859294115) plan is similar but with 5 runs a week instead of 6, and somewhat lower mileage and intensity.

**Runna comparison**

I searched Strava for training plans and was quickly funneled into Runna, which delays showing you their paywall and I got sucked in. Decided to try the one week free trial and see what it provides. I gave it my age, current mileage, current 10k time, and date of target race 6 weeks from now. I said I could do 3 runs a week, and it prescribes exactly that - one workout (intervals or tempo), one long run, and an easy run. Intervals vary in length, tempo run structures vary, and the long run may include progressive speed work. It suggested a goal time of 47:30 (my race is pretty flat).

Very thoroughly structured plan, with useful training tips from ""Coach Steph"", I like it - but with the free trial I can't see the details beyond week two, and I'm not willing to pay $180 a year for it. Pretty similar to the ChatGPT plan, but more in-depth. If money were no object I would definitely favour Runna over ChatGPT - no surprise since while I'm sure they are using AI, they no doubt also use statistical models and other running-specific content, not to mention having a direct link to your Strava results.

**Jack Daniels (not) comparison**

I would have compared to Jack Daniels plans, but they are paywalled online, so I didn't look at those. I once read Daniels Running Formula, but that was years ago and I no longer have the book.

**Race day!**

I followed the ChatGPT plan as prescribed, with a little more strength training and cross-training than indicated. Nutrition and sleep were good leading up to the race and I executed fairly well on race day - went out a little too hard, but was feeling good and mostly managed to hang onto a solid pace. I struggled a bit in kilometers 8 and 9, but it wouldn't be a 10k if I didn't! I finished in 46:39, significantly faster than my 50 minute target, and even a little faster than my 47 minute aspirational goal.

You can see my run [on Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/16613553001) if you're curious, or the full details of the Vancouver Historic 5K, 10K and Half Marathon event [here](https://www.tryevents.ca/vancouver-historic-half).

I put my result into [Howard Grubb's age-grading calculator](https://www.howardgrubb.co.uk/athletics/mldrroad25.html), and it turns out that 46:39 at age 57 is actually better (68%) than my 39:57 lifetime PR at age 25 (66%). Hence my claim that ChatGPT coached me to my best ever 10k result. :-)

**Conclusions**

To summarize, most training plans prescribe a mix of hard runs (intervals, tempo), long runs (possibly with some pace pickups) and easy volume. If you commit to any of these plans you will likely have a good race. ChatGPT is totally capable of generating such a plan, and if your prompts are accurate and thorough and you have a good idea what training you need and what load you can handle, then you can certainly get ChatGPT to draw up a plan for you. I had a good race on relatively low volume, but I think this can be attributed in large part to both my summer triathlon training, and (especially) to the three weekly strength workouts I've been doing for the past couple of years.

You shouldn't rely solely on ChatGPT - check it against other plans available online or that you have used in the past. Where ChatGPT shines is in being able to tailor and refine the plan based on your specific goals, constraints and habits - for me, I had it build in my existing strength and cross-training regimen. From the various other plans I looked at, I did really like Runna, I just wasn't willing to pay for it.

**ChatGPT 6 week tailored 10k plan**

Here is exactly what ChatGPT gave me. I could have continued prompting it to generate a weekly spreadsheet with daily activities, but I went with just this outline and fine-tuned the programming each week to suit my schedule. I've included *notes in italics* about what I actually did each week.

Here's your **updated 6-week 10K training plan** — now including an **optional 3rd weekly run** (short and easy), placed strategically to support recovery, improve aerobic capacity, and help edge you toward your 47-minute goal — without overloading you.

# Weekly Structure Overview

* **Run 1:** Key workout (intervals or tempo)

# Race Day — Saturday, November 30

* **Warm-up:** 10–15 min jog + dynamic mobility + 3–4 strides *(Done)*
* **Race strategy:**
   * Km 1–2: ease into pace \~4:45/km *(Km 1 4:31, oops)*
   * Km 3–8: hold 4:40/km if aiming for 47 minutes *(Done, 4:35-4:40)*
   * Km 9–10: if feeling strong, push to 4:30/km and finish strong *(Just hanging on! 4:40-4:45)*

# Final Tips

* **Listen to your body**: Drop the optional 3rd run or cross-train day if you're feeling tired. *(Generally felt good and almost always did the extra run and a bit more cross-training than in the plan.)*
* **Fueling**: Eat a carb-rich meal the night before your long runs and the race. *(Ate lots the day before, and got up early race day and had a big breakfast of oatmeal with an egg and nuts and seeds. Plus a couple cups of coffee. And a gel right before the race.)*
* **Sleep**: Prioritize good sleep in Week 5 and especially in race week. *(8-10 hours the 3 nights before the race)*
* **Test gear**: Use your race shoes and clothes during tempo runs or long runs to avoid surprises on race day. *(Got new shoes mid-way through training and used them for most subsequent runs.)*",1764622808.0,0,7,running,fitness

1p7ca2c,Shoe mileage?,"Ok.. so the “internet” recommends 300-500 miles for replacement of shoes. Seems slightly outdated and obviously driven by shoe company’s.

I once took a pair of Salomon speedcross to 1500km and was in agony by the end. They DID need replaced. But I wanted to make them last a year… which they didn’t.

What do you generally/rule of thumb take yours to? A set amount or just until it feels right?

Also… treadmill trainers. I have a set which I only use for treadmills (while I’m at work on a boat with no access to dry land). Is the treadmill gentler on shoes? Current pair at 800km and look ok.

Edit. Yikes. That’s a lot of feedback. Thank you all very much. Seems like both ends of the scale covered. But largely a lot of similar answers. For the record I do already track my shoe/s mileage. Unfortunately I can’t really listen to my legs and feet as they are pretty much always sore. I’m almost 6 years into a run streak. At least 5km a day every day.

I get so bored I just want to be done. I've tried switching up my running routes and while this helps on my slow runs, if I'm aiming for pace I find it easier to rely on routes I'm familiar with (so I don't ""waste"" time or have to slow down because I got lost or ran into a dead end lol).

I mostly run outside and live in city, I try to find nicer routes (next to a river or forest or something) but a bigger chunk is always on not so nice streets.

### Training
I used the NRC app's marathon plan. I had previously used it for C25K a long time back, then slightly more recently for the 10k plan, then half marathon. I then followed the marathon plan until around the 30k run which I failed 3 times due to improper preparation and weather, then went back to the half marathon plan to run my 2nd half. After that I used the marathon plan.

Typically I ran 5x/week, with 4x/week lifting (2ish leg days), and 1x/week hockey. I tried my best to prioritize going slower than my best (unlike in previous race trainings), and there were several times I was running on tired legs. I tried to avoid leg days and running on the same day, I did my shortest runs on my hockey days, and I stopped lifting/hockey the week before.

### Pre-race
My family came in from far away to support me, and we had a nice pasta dinner and I carb loaded a lot during the week prior. Raceday, I had the same breakfast I always do (greek yogurt+granola+frozen fruit+protein powder) plus a granola bar, prepared my running vest, then got driven to the race.

I got there about 20 minutes early and it was freezing. It was snowing and super windy. I bought an oversized hoodie and some gloves from Goodwill the day prior in preparation for this, but I was cold even before I shed the hoodie. I lined up next to the 5hr pacer and queued up my music playlist.

### Race
It started at 7am on the dot. After about 50m I shed my hoodie, and I unexpectedly kept my gloves for the entire race (hands were frozen for about half of it). I felt really good, in my training my slow/far pace was typically 11:30-12:00, but my legs weren't tired so I felt good enough to stay around 11:00 for basically the entire race. 

The atmosphere was incredible. At first it snowed, but eventually it stopped and got taken over by falling leaves. People were all smiles and super happy (at least before mile 18ish) and there were tons of spectators cheering us on despite the cold. I got to stop and pet a dog by a person with a Free pets! sign, and one person I took an apple slice from. Along the way, I passed up a couple beer opportunities, also some gummy candies and muffins.

I realized pretty quickly into this race that there was a kink in my water vest because the tube was bent awkwardly, and I didn't want to stop and fix it (especially with the cold), so I just ran with a vest full of water the entire time. I has two water bottles which lasted me most of the race anyways. My GU gels were much thicker than I was used to because of the cold, but the real challenge was getting them open. (Fun fact, I might be the only one but I really like the taste of gels.)

I had 3 bathroom breaks, pretty evenly spaced out, and had to wait for two of them. That's probably my biggest future time save haha.

I didn't start feeling soreness (in my achilles) until about halfway really, and it only kinda started ramping up around 17ish. I didn't really feel like I hit a wall in particular. Earlier in my training I did a 20 miler (my longest run) starting with really sore legs (I went pretty slow), so I was kind of used to it but better prepared. Mentally it was kinda hard a little past halfway (I was kinda bored) and mile 20ish. Knowing I was close but still had an hour to go was rough, and I constantly kept checking my watch hoping to be almost done.

I got passed by a lot of 10kers and half marathoners who started 20min later than me. But after the first half, I had a lot of space. 11:00min/mi is a weird pace because it's kinda in between 5:00:00 and 4:45:00 so I guess not many people were aiming for it. I didn't struggle with any hills, so I passed many hill walkers throughout.

On the final hill (toward the end of mile 25), I maintained my pace, then sped up a bit, then I saw the finish line and sprinted the last part somehow. I think the baked potato bar was calling me and gave me extra strength.

### Post-race
I was super happy with my finish and training results. My hands were too cold to eat the food, which actually helped because it prevented me from devouring too much food too fast. My family had only been able to spot me a couple times throughout because my tracking app was inaccurate, but they all helped me recover at the end.

I kind of have recovered pretty quickly and don't feel as sore as I expected. The training 20mi I literally collapsed on the ground after, which goes to show how important it is to train on tired legs.

Shoutout to the Clifton Hoka 10s for unexpectedly not being horrible shoes this race. I really haven't liked them, and the laces haven't been holding together after not much time, but my shoes never got untied from their double knot. I still probably won't be buying more cliftons, even though I loved the 9s.

At the beginning of the race, my biggest motivation was seeing all of the work and dedication and discipline and sacrifice of the past few months come to fruition. Around halfway, it changed to making my loved ones proud, and showing that their support meant I could complete something really challenging and meaningful to me. By the end, it was for the baked potato bar. I told my gf this, and she said she was a bit disappointed but understood. I told her I felt bad, but it also was a really good baked potato.

Thanks for reading :) Feel free to ama!

I really enjoy longer trail efforts and tend to recover better on softer surfaces, so I’d love to hear from runners who have completed events that fit that profile.

What I’m looking for isn’t necessarily the “flattest” race, but something that offers a manageable elevation profile for a first-time marathoner who’s more comfortable with rolling terrain than big climbs.

* had a friendly or energetic atmosphere
* featured scenic or memorable sections
* provided good support or logistics

1or071h,Training with a busy schedule,"Hello everyone, just here for a bit of advice really. I’ve been running on and off for a few years now and also kept fit with other sports. This year I’ve been running more frequently, and I’ve got my first marathon coming up in another 6 months.

The issue is, I have a busy job in healthcare that often involves 12 hour shifts on my feet, night shifts, weekends etc. When you add the commute to the shift length, there are really not many hours left in the day.  This makes it quite tricky to run regularly and follow a strict training plan. I just went for my first run in almost 2 weeks (I was sick and then working lots) and it was frankly horrendous 😂 I missed the pace targets that I definitely could have hit if I’d been training more consistently.

Just wondering if anyone else who works long hours has any advice or words of wisdom for how to manage this. I have no expectations of running a particularly quick time, but it would be nice to know I gave it my best shot.

### Training
I booked this race as soon as I got the opportunity, which was in January via Abbott's Age Group World Champions (AGWC) scheme, in the age category 65-69. There was extra cost, but also a few perks like a Wave 1 start and a dedicated tent in the start village, plus it sounds grand! I booked the flights and hotel; then in April ran Manchester marathon and qualified (just!) to run as an England Masters Representative in the Abingdon Marathon. That also seemed like a great opportunity, though it was just two weeks before New York. I figured I would run Abingdon in the best time I could manage, and then run New York without worrying much about the pace.

I trained therefore for Abingdon, using the Pfitzinger and Douglas 18/55 schedule from their book Advanced Marathoning. I added some extra miles where possible, on the basis that high mileage would help me with the intensive fortnight to come. Peak week over the training period was 71.5 miles. Three week taper for Abingdon in the normal way, that race went well and I got a PB of 3:25:33.

I was then into two weeks of recovery/taper for New York, punctuated by a 10 mile race in the middle weekend. Ran that with a 10 mile PB, then on the Thursday headed from the UK to New York.

On Saturday I ran the Abbott Dash to the Finish Line 5K with my wife, intending to run it as a shake-out at around 8:00/mile. This is a delightful race with around 10,000 runners, from the United Nations building through the streets of Manhattan and into Central Park, with the finish being the same as for the marathon the following day. I ran a little faster than planned and was surprised to find myself 3rd in age category, perhaps because most marathon runners in the race were more sensible and saved their legs.

Saturday afternoon though things began to fall apart. We had been in all sorts of crowds and queues, at the airport and on trains and planes, at the expo, near the Village Parade (Halloween celebration) on Friday evening, and more. I picked up some kind of mild bug; I didn't feel right, my nose was blocked and my throat was sore. With these things, you never know if it is the beginning of something worse, or something that will soon clear up. I did the best thing I could think of, which was to sleep as much as possible. So at 20:00 I was in bed with the alarm set for 4:00am. It was not an easy night as fretted about how I felt, and whether I should even run at all. Missing the race would be wretched after so much preparation and getting to New York; on the other hand, running while sick could make a mild illness much worse.

Luckily I made a good recovery overnight; and who knows, maybe there was a touch of maranoia in there too. My nose was clear, my stomach was fine, and the sore throat nearly gone. Got up, grabbed my start bag, and headed for the subway to the New York Public Library and the 5:00am bus to the start.

### Pre-race
Arriving at the library at 4:45am was confusing at first. There were buses in front of the library but no queues and it took me a while to figure out that the you had to wait at the back of the library, where I joined hundreds of other runners and began to feel a bit of race excitement. The bus, we were warned, could take up to 90 minutes. In practice though it took less than half that time, presumably because of the early hour, and we were unloaded into a cold, pitch-dark start area at at about 5:40am, three and half hours before the race started.

I had been told that the start village is not a great experience and so it proved. The first challenge was to find the AGWC tent; the signage was not brilliant but after wandering around for a bit I figured out that there are several different colour villages, and that my village was orange. A volunteer pointed me in the right direction and I found the AGWC area which actually had two tents with plastic seats, the same bagels and coffee that were on offer everywhere, and some dedicated portaloos. There were nowhere near enough seats for everyone so I sat on the grass in one of the tents, grateful that it was a bit warmer than outside, and chatted to some other runners. One told me that she had done a 100 mile race two weeks ago, and the Marine Corps Marathon (MCM) a week ago, which made my own schedule look easy. Tapering is overdone, she said, adding that she ran for the experience not the performance.

At around 8:10am we were led round to the start corral, went in an milled around for a bit, then decided I should do a bit of warming up, exited the corral and ran round in circles with some others, doing perhaps half a mile at easy pace. Then back into the corral before it closed at 8:45. I felt OK and ready to start.

As we got near to the start time of 9:10am the ribbons dividing Orange A B and C were removed and we moved up to the bridge and the start line. I consumed my first gel. Frank Sinatra sang New York New York. At last, after the most complicated race logistics I have encountered, we were running.

### Race
The marathon begins with a slow gentle climb up the bridge and everything was fine. I tried to hold about an 8:00/mile pace which would get me a 3:30. The weather was perfect and the crowd support started as soon as we arrived into Brooklyn; it was amazing. 

All went well until about half way; pace slipped a bit in miles 11 and 12 but not badly. After mile 13 though I began to slow down. It was not hitting the wall; it was just fatigue, combined with three other factors:

- I was not at my best after feeling unwell the day before
- I had run intensively over the previous two weeks including a marathon, a 10 mile race and then the Dash to the Finish Line 5K
- The time did not matter that much to me. I had planned for this to be an easier race having gone all-out at Abingdon

I do not know which of these factors was the most important. Running a race though is a mental as well as a physical effort, and whereas in my previous marathons I was highly motivated to get a target time, for this one all I wanted was something respectable, and when I found it hard to keep the pace I just let it slip.

I had some other issues. One was that the Garmin got further and further ahead of the mile markers. This is inevitable as one does not take the shortest path; but seemed worse than usual; my final Garmin distance was 26.57 miles. I looked at the Garmin less than usual, for this reason and also because I knew I would not like the pace it showed.

Another was nausea. I took a gel at the start and again at 5 miles, 10 miles and 15 miles. I stopped at the water stations when thirsty which was about 1 in 3 of them. I would normally take another at 20 miles but my body was telling me that if I did, I might vomit. Better, I thought, to keep my stomach settled rather than throw up.

Despite all the above, I loved the race. It was as if I had compartmentalised my brain; one part was thinking about race strategy, while another was just enjoying the experience of running over bridges with jaw-dropping views and through the boroughs of New York City each with their own character, while being cheered constantly by a crowd of New Yorkers.

I had paid a ridiculous $10.00 to have my name on the bib; it was a waste of money because printed so small. However I was wearing my club vest which said ""Winchester Running Club"", and heard constant shouts of encouragement for ""Winchester!"" and also had a few chats with other runners who knew the city or were curious which Winchester it was. One said, ""are you red or blue?"" I was puzzled but then realised he had read the name as ""Manchester"" and was referencing two famous football teams! So I explained.

At around mile 21 I attempted to do some sums to work out what sort of time I could manage. I knew 3:30 was well out of reach but sub-3:45 still seemed possible and I wanted to achieve that. So I put in some effort to keep my pace; most of the variation in those last miles is because of climbs or descents. Going into Central Park was a big boost and I loved the experience of running there. Then you go out onto the street briefly, then back into Central Park for the finish. Waved at my wife who had somehow bagged a great spectator position around 200m from the finish, crossed the line in 3:37:39 which was only a few seconds worse than my time at Abingdon Marathon 2024. If I am reading correctly, it is a good enough time to get me into the NYC marathon next year, should I wish to repeat the experience.

### Post-race
The finish experience was not that great, too much walking and waiting before I was done. You are moved on quickly for obvious reasons; with nearly 60,000 runners it could easily clog up. I picked up a goody bag, the lovely medal, a second finisher medal for AGWC, and a bright orange poncho. Then I was in another line for an AGWC photo, then picked up my dropped bag (very quick), found my wife and headed back to the hotel. 
 
The subway journey though was amazing, so many people sayng ""congratulations"" when they saw the poncho and medal.

The following day we headed out early; the finish area was being dismantled but there was a photo spot for showing off your medal and getting your picture taken (on your own mobile phone) by a volunteer. There was also the marathon pavilion with copies of the New York Times showing all the sub-4 hour finishers plus a few more, medal engraving, and some official finisher shirts and tops. After that we squeezed in a free trip (for medal holders) to the spectacular Top of the Rock at the Rockefeller Center before we had to go to the airport for the flight home.

### Tips and learnings
- Doing two marathons in two weeks is not for everyone. A carefully managed taper followed by the race and then a recovery plan is the right approach if you want the best time and lower injury risk. But if you find, as I do, that you recover quite quickly, then it can be done without disaster.

- The travel and stress of getting to the start line for a major marathon thousands of miles from home is substantial and does not help your health or your pace.

- Regarding the NYC marathon, for those staying in Manhattan the main options for travel to the start are the bus or the ferry. I chose the bus because it goes direct to the start, whereas with the ferry you still need a bus from the ferry terminal to the start. The snag with the bus though is that you have leave really early, before the roads close. With hindsight I wish I had taken the ferry, which would have given me a bit more time in bed and got me to the start later.

- The AGWC is extra cost but has some nice extras; having the tents at the start village was a big bonus despite the overcrowding. I do have reservations though about starting in wave 1. The problem was that many of us would normally be in a later wave, so we were overtaken by faster runners and the pace team was no use. On the plus side, earlier start means earlier finish. The water stations were plentiful but lack of trash bins meant most cups were simply dropped on the ground and became a slip hazard; I am guessing that this gets worse for later waves since the volunteers cannot easily sweep them away.

- The energy and excitement of the NYC marathon is like nothing I have experienced before; it is a great run and worth striving for.

# History

I live in Thailand, where running in 30°C (86°F) heat and a 24°C (75°F) dew point is the norm. Because of that, I usually only sign up for one half marathon a year, usually during my Europe trip in October when the weather is much more comfortable.

I started running about 10 years ago (I’m 40 now), nothing serious and definitely not with a structured plan. I’d just go out and run 10K every day, with one faster 5K day each week. My PBs back then were 2:02 for the half marathon and around 50 minutes for 10K, both in Thailand’s humidity. I can’t exactly remember why I stopped, but I once ran a poorly organized half marathon where I bonked at 10K and the turnaround wasn’t marked correctly. A bunch of us ended up running over 27 km. I probably lost motivation after that and eventually stopped racing altogether. During COVID, unlike most people, I ran even less and lost interest completely.

I started running again in late 2023. My non-running girlfriend somehow started running, and that got me back into it too. Once again, no structure, no plan, just running 10K four to five times a week. After about nine months, I ran a 1:53 half marathon in Dijon, France, shaving around nine minutes off my old PB. The conditions were much better, though it was still quite humid. I did get a small calf cramp at 17 km and had to slow down a bit until the end.

After Dijon, I increased my daily distance to 12 km. Pace depended on how I felt that day: if I felt good, I’d push to 5:15 min/km, and if not, I’d keep it easy around 5:45–6:30 min/km. I tried to balance faster and easier runs.

During Thailand’s “winter,” I ran a solo half marathon at the park and finished in 1:50:12. The weather helped a lot (23°C with a 10°C dew point).

I also set some training PBs: a 10K in 48:12 while in Croatia in May and a 5K in 23:23 back home in July.

# Training

In July 2025, I made Sundays my long run day to prepare for the Venice Half in October. I kept running four to five times a week at no specific pace until August, when I asked Gemini to make a plan to help me run a 1:40 half marathon. That’s a 4:44 min/km pace, something I’d never sustained for 21 km before.

Gemini gave me a 10-week plan with four runs per week (plus an optional fifth easy run):

* Sunday: Long run
* Monday: Easy
* Tuesday: Intervals
* Thursday: Tempo

It included a pace chart: Intervals at 4:30, Tempo at 4:50, and Steady runs at 5:40 min/km, with adjustments for more ideal weather.

I found it odd that the longest tempo run was only 8 km, hard to imagine that translating to a 1:40 half but I followed the plan pretty closely, sometimes running slightly faster than what the plan prescribed. Gemini kept telling me I was dumb for ignoring the paces, but it also told me I might actually be able to run around 1:36 or even 1:35, and it updated my training paces as I went.

My Europe trip started in early October, with the Venice Half on the 26th. I kept training while traveling and even ran a 10K time trial during my first week in Europe, clocking a new PB of 43:27, which lined up perfectly with a predicted 1:36:21 half according to VDOT, pretty much around what Gemini had projected.

# Pre-race

Since I was on holiday, my legs weren’t exactly rested. I was walking around constantly, and the day before the race I logged over 20,000 steps (which, to be fair, is normal for me) although that included a 5K shakeout run. For dinner, I had a big pizza, which I guess counts as carb loading.

Race morning, I woke up early to catch the bus. Breakfast was some supermarket focaccia and an iced canned coffee mostly to get the digestive process going. Once at the starting area I jogged 1 km to warm up, used the bathroom a few times, and slotted myself between the 1:35 and 1:40 pacers. My heart rate jumped from 90 to about 140 bpm before the start. Maybe it was nerves, or maybe the Italian national anthem just got me hyped.

# Race

The start was chaotic. There were no real corrals, just pacers, and I quickly realized a lot of slower runners had started up front. The first kilometer was slower than planned as I had to weave through the crowd. I guess that’s nothing out of the ordinary for any race. Even last year in Dijon, my first kilometer was around 6:00 min/km while the rest were closer to 5:15–5:20. Strava clocked it at 4:45 min/km, though GPS might’ve been off since the route went through buildings in Mestre.

The first 4 km were uneventful. We ran through some neighborhoods in Mestre with hardly any crowd support. I saw a band setting up, probably for the full marathon runners who started later. I managed to hold a consistent pace, aiming around 4:30 min/km to make up for the slower start. At this point, the effort felt like an 8/10, and I wasn’t sure I could maintain it the whole race. To be fair, this was about my interval pace back in Thailand, but I kept reminding myself that since I’d just run 43:27 for 10K, I should be able to handle this.

From kilometer 4 to 10, we ran through Parco San Giuliano, which I had already run through the day before for my shakeout, so I was familiar with the area. Again, I held a 4:30 min/km pace. I took a gel around 9 km, thinking the water station was at 10 km, but it didn’t come until around 10.7 km. I should’ve timed that better.

Next came the 5 km bridge connecting Mestre to Venice, easily the most boring stretch of the race. No crowds, just sparse groups of runners. My average pace started creeping up bit by bit, so I had to consciously pick it up to maintain my overall pace.

Once we entered Venice, things got more interesting but also more difficult. We first ran through an industrial area, which was uneventful but still a nice change after the monotonous bridge. Around kilometer 16, I tried to cut a corner and slightly misstepped, causing my right calf to spasm. I was really hoping it wouldn’t turn into a full cramp.

I took another gel here since the final water station was supposed to be at km 17. Unfortunately, it didn’t appear until around km 17.5, again later than expected, just like the first one. The delay threw off my fueling slightly, but it didn't matter much, I guess.

After leaving the industrial zone, we started running along the water in Venice. The surface was made of large, uneven bricks. Not ideal after 17 km of smooth roads. There were also a bunch of small bridges to go over. I think we were supposed to run over 14 bridges or something? I noticed the water level was already rising. When I passed through, there were only a few puddles, but later I found out that by the time the full marathoners reached San Marco, the water was probably nearly ankle height.

Unfortunately, the cramp in my right calf did become a problem again. By the time I reached San Marco (around 19–20 km), I was half running, half limping. The cramp got worse every time I went up a bridge. My pace dropped to 4:35–4:40 min/km, though it felt much slower at the time because I was struggling so much just to keep running.

It was frustrating because the atmosphere was incredible, exactly the same energy I remembered when I was a spectator back in 2023. I’d hoped it would give me a final boost, but with the cramp, I couldn’t take advantage of it. What a shame, since that memory was part of the reason my girlfriend and I wanted to come back and race here.

In the final kilometer, I had to stop on top of the final bridge to stretch for a few seconds, otherwise I would’ve had to limp across the finish line. I ran the last km at a disappointing 5:01 min/km and crossed the line in 1:36:39.

# Post-race

I took nearly 14 minutes off my unofficial PB, so I was very happy with the result. Knowing that I could’ve gone a bit faster without the cramp will definitely motivate me to improve for next year’s fall half marathon.

I also realized afterward that I’d run the entire race above my LTHR (field-tested, so I’m not sure how accurate it was). No wonder it started feeling hard just 3–4 km in.

Cramping late in races isn’t new for me, but this was actually an improvement. In Dijon last year, the cramps started with 5 km left; this time, they only hit during the last 2 km.

Did I undertrain? Possibly. I did some workouts at faster-than-prescribed paces to get used to running harder in better conditions, but my long runs didn’t include half-marathon pace segments. Gemini had me running them at adjusted marathon pace instead.

# What's next?

My next goal is to break 1:30. Gemini thought that was unrealistic, so I ""fired"" it. 😄

I’ve since ""hired"" a new AI coach (still Gemini, just a new chat) since I’m actually quite happy with the structured plan it provides. I just need to get better at prompting.

According to VDOT, I should be capable of running a 3:21 full marathon (well below sub-4:00!) if trained properly, which gives me hope that I can eventually find the time and mental strength to go the full distance in a few years.",1762358290.0,33,8,running,fitness

1oo1ca0,Mental training strategies that actually worked for marathon/ultra prep! What's worked for you?,"Finished my first Ironman this year (Emilia Romagna, Italy), but before that, I did several marathons. Running has always been my primary sport and gateway into endurance training.

The physical training was hard, but the mental side nearly broke me during those marathon builds and definitely during IM prep.

The 5 a.m. ""why am I doing this"" spirals. The dread before the 30k long run. The guilt when life derailed a key training week. The mid-run doubts asking if you're even cut out for this.

I tried a bunch of stuff: journaling, talking to my coach, mental reframing exercises, podcasts during easy runs. Some helped, some didn't. 

**Curious: What's worked for you when training gets mentally tough?** Not looking for ""just be disciplined"" or ""suck it up"" answers. Genuinely want to know what strategies, tools, or mindset shifts made a real difference when motivation tanked or anxiety spiked.

I'm having a few 15-20 min conversations with runners about this (trying to map what's common vs. what's just me being weird 😅). If you've dealt with training anxiety, motivation dips, or mental blocks during a marathon/ultra build and want to chat, drop a comment or DM me.

I've been seeing contradictory things around how much time/effort to invest into speed work during base building periods (which I understand to be around 2-3 months for most people?). 

  
How would the following affect base building:

*  Occassional tempo runs (once every 2 weeks)
* Finishing easy runs with negative splits in the last km (something around threshold pace)
* Progression runs

I understand that the main purpose is aerobic capacity building and speed work done mainly for the purpose of muscle/technique building, but I'm afraid going primarily easy for a few months would lead to decreases in VO2 max and lactate threshold, which I built up for a HM prep the last time out.

1oih539,What objective / external measures do you use to guide your training?,"I \[35M\] have been running on and off for \~20 years. I was an okay high school XC/track athlete, and have had three serious attempts to get back into good running shape over the years. Every attempt ends when I pick up a series of nagging injuries. Lately I'm back up to running 20mpw and feeling great. I'm really enjoying running right now.

Despite following the common wisdom: the 10% rule, 80/20 running, etc., I have a tendency to ""rev up"" my easy runs a little too much, and quickly end up injuring myself. ""Listening to my body"" just doesn't work for me--as soon as I am out running I like the feeling of going a little harder and testing myself.

When I do have success, it's because I am able to use some objective, external measurement, like heart rate training, to self-limit. This is *especially* true on my easy days.

What objective external measurements are you using to manage your training? What has worked and what hasn't?",1761675695.0,48,48,running,fitness

1ogrl5n,Beginner runner here (28F) — aiming for 5–10K by December. How did you go from casual fitness to actually feeling like “a runner”?,"Hey everyone 👋

I’m 28F and pretty new to running, though I’ve been active for a while. I do yoga, strength training a few times a week, and usually hit around 10K steps daily. Running, however, always felt like something I wanted to get good at someday — and ultimately, I’d love to run a marathon one day (though that feels very far off right now!).

I’ve just started running every other day. My most recent run was 1 km in about 9:42, with an average cadence of 145 spm and average heart rate around 155 bpm — my Apple Watch (SE 2nd gen) rated the effort as moderate. I’m not chasing pace right now; I’m focusing on form, breathing, and just building the habit.

My short-term goal is to be able to comfortably run 5–10K by December. I’ve read about cadence, breathing techniques, and easy runs, but I’d love to hear from actual runners:
	•	What mistakes did you make early on that you’d avoid now?
	•	What helped you build endurance or improve your mindset?
	•	Were there any small changes (gear, warm-ups, mental cues, etc.) that made a big difference for you?
	•	And how did you stay patient when progress felt slow?

Right now, I’m just trying to be consistent while learning to enjoy running itself. Would love to hear your experiences and lessons from your early days — what helped you go from someone who runs occasionally to someone who feels like a runner.

Thanks in advance for sharing your stories — they’re super motivating for beginners like me! 🏃‍♀️💫",1761502282.0,108,138,running,fitness

# Background

I've always loved running, when I was younger I was a decent high school sprinter. I'd often qualify for ROPSAA (Regionals) in the 100m and 200m, never came close to OFSAA (Provincials). But then was forced to run cross-country because my sprinting coach caught me smoking cigarettes and forced me to run distance as my penalty. Thank you Ms Miller! I perhaps could've run varsity track, but I just wanted to drink and be an idiot in University (wrong choice!)

I was VERY into Crossfit for about a decade, didn't train any running, but still had a bit of a natural ability and did well in the running type workouts. Crossfit style workouts are also very good for aenorobic fitness. Stopped Crossfit in 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic and instead started to run again and lift like a normal person. This didn't last long though and the volume wasn't there, about \~300km of running in 2020/2021 total. This was just tempo 5k's over and over wondering why I wasn't getting faster.

I picked running back up in May 2024. And since then have logged 3,264km as of this post. I still remember that first run back in 2024, a 27:53 5K and I was GASSED!

I am brand new to racing in my adult life. My first official race was a 5k Turkey Trot fall of 2024 with my 10 year old son. He seems to have some talent, his 5k PR is 20:53.

**Races in my short racing career:**

**Oct 20, 2024:** 5K Turkey Trot - 27:xx (we ran 6.7km because the lead pack took a wrong turn)

**Nov 2, 2024:** Half Marathon - 1:28:xx

**March 30, 2025:** Around the Bay 30k (oldest race in N.America est.1894) - 2:23:xx

**Apr 27, 2025:** First full marathon: 3:25:xx

**May 24, 2025:** Sulphur Springs Trail Race w/ 1350m elevation - 5:31:xx (I ended up running 52.5km, took a wrong turn)

**May 31, 2025:** 1k local charity run with my daughter - 6:42 (MY FAVOURITE RACE!)

**Oct 18, 2025:** Toronto Waterfront Marathon - 3:08:xx

I also have some very bad gremlins. None of my running friends really know this, but I vape regularly (helped me to quit cigarettes) and I smoke cannabis daily. This is the single most embarassing thing in my life, addiction is no joke and I know I need all of it out of my life. My wife always tells me how dumb I am and that if I quit my vices that'd be an automatic 5mins less in a marathon. She's probably right!

# Training

As a father of 2 young kids, coaching both kids hockey teams and fitness trainer for my son's soccer team, plus being a taxi driver for all of their other extra curriculars; it's always been very hard to strictly follow a proper training plan. My saving grace is that I WFH full-time, which gives me flexibility in the morning and allows me to go on lunch runs. The kids are also a little older so I can leave the house for 2-3 hour runs (between hockey practices/games) on weekends and my wife is fine with it!

Time being such a commodity. I'd run whenever I could. During Soccer/Hockey practice, I'd run home from family grocery trips, from IKEA, the hockey arena. Pretty much, any time I could find a window to run, I would. The key for me, was using time that didn't take away from my kids. I never enjoy the runs when I know they are just at home waiting for me, guilt sets in heavily.

When training for my first Marathon beginning of this year, a soccer tournament popped up for my son on the exact weekend I had registered for the Toronto Spring Marathon. This stopped me in my tracks mid-training block. I wasn't sure what to do, had a mental block with the scheduling conflict, and didn't take my training seriously in February (took 3 weeks off entirely from running). But then I found another marathon which was a week prior to my scheduled race. So I registered and was panicking that I shoudn't have taken a break in the block.

Something similar happened for this fall, Toronto Waterfront Marathon sold out much earlier than I had expected. So I again took a break from my training block in June, wasn't sure I'd find a bib and was hard to train not being sure if I was even going to run in the fall! And then went on vacation to Asia for 2 weeks (got about 100km of leisure/z2 running in) and Disney right after for a week (got about 65km's of leisure/z2 running in). Both very hot places (I don't do well running in heat), but had some very early morning to still get some km's in. Due to the heat, no tempo runs, no interval runs, just easy runs for the month of August.

I then found a bib for TWM, and naturally panicked because I was far behind on my almost non-existent training block. Mind you, I had a solid base running 40-60km's/week before vacation. So my block really only started Aug25. Not a lot of time. I loosely followed pfitz 18/70 with four 100km+ weeks in a row. By this point I had resided to the fact that I wasn't going to BQ, it was too late. I just wanted to PR.

But this short block went very well! How did it go so well? Finding an incredible training partner. We pushed each other HARD. I'd say our best run was when we took a train 30km out of town and ran back. We did 5k WU, 21K at MP, 4k CD and that really pumped me up. Had some really solid long run fartleks doing 2k and 3k intervals. What we did lack however on this block, was track sessions. I always found the track days is where I'd see the most gains.

I was also heavier after the Disney trip. I workout A LOT and was holding too much upper body muscle. It was slowing me down. So 4 weeks before Race Day I just completely stopped lifting upper body and lost 6lbs.

# Pre-race

Because of my short training block, I only did a 1 week taper. I pushed volume and intensity all the way until the Sunday before. But taper week I only ran about 20km's total before race day.

Started to carb load 3 days before, slowly ramping up and on the Saturday must've had at least 600g of carbs from pasta, apple juice, white bread and bagels. Felt so bloadted and gross, I tend to lean towards protein over carbs as a personal prefence, so this was hard! I was coaching hockey with plain bagels in both of my pockets!

I was hoping to get to bed early, but my son's hockey schedule foiled the plans. He had practice from 7:30-8:30pm. So as soon as I got home I had a small snack, water and salt, a joint, and then bed. I think I fell asleep around 11:30pm.

Woke up at 5am. Had one espresso, Maurten Drink Mix 320 Caf 100, half a bagel with peanut butter and honey, and a banana. I tried not to drink too many more liquids, as I get really bad nervous pees when in starting corrals.

In an Uber by 6am, picked my running partner up and we headed into the city. The entire city was blocked off so we just got out of our Uber about 1.5km from the start line, and used that as a bit of a warmup.

I was not in a good headspace. The winds were blowing, and it was unusually warm for a mid-october morning. Decided I didn't need a throwaway jacket it was so warm. I just kept telling myself ""OK, no BQ today but at least PR"". After a few quick pees (like 4 in the span of 30 minutes) we found our spot in the corral, about 100m from the start, so we were with some very fast runners.

# Race

This marathon had both the 1/2 and full runners start together. My running partner and I kept reminding each other to maintain pace and not go out too quickly with some of the elite runners in our corral, as well as the 1/2 marathoners. Well, the gun went off and everyone around us just took off like bullets. Because of the tall buildings, initially my pace was kind of all over the place on my Garmin. I couldn't trust it so I just paced with the ""slower"" runners around me. My partner did not, he went ahead and I lost him within about 30 seconds.

The crowds were ELECTRIC! Our mayor was even out dancing to a marching band playing Bad Romance and handing out high-fives. In my opinion, she is a great mayor, but that's not what this post is about. I thought with the weather, crowds may have been lighter, but our city showed up!

Let's break down this race.

**1-2km** I was running too fast, started at the front of the corral with 1/2 marathoners and found it hard to slow down. I kept thinking ""you've gotta slow down, this is not the way to start"" But ultimately I think the quick start got me into a faster pace which helped me get into a rhythm. 

**3-7km** was south on Bathurst, this stretch was all downhill. Some Northern wind, but the slight downhill was helpful. This street has a very popular running store, Black Toe Running, which had a ton of support for their runners. I couldn't hear myself think when I passed that store and felt energized! Felt like I was settling in and feeling ok. I was trying to run a little slower, but eventually the momentum from the downhill made me run faster than I wanted to. 

**8-12km** the crowd thinned out a bit, but still a lot of great energy. Still felt too fast, HR was creeping up to 168 so I backed off a bit until the turn. I remember hitting the 10km mark and thinking ""F, that's less than 25%"" and wondered how I could maintain pace for that long. This course turns around at 13km, to run east. We saw the elites at this point, about 15 in a pack, and we all just screamed and shouted as loud as we could at them. It was pretty incredible to see.  

**13-20km** The course switches back eastbound and runs along the Lakeshore to Downtown Toronto. The 3:05 pacer crept up behind me. A sign that I HAD been running too quickly. But I felt good so I tucked in the middle of the group, trying to use other bodies to block all of the wind. At about 18km there was an annoying and long hill, not too steep, but steep enough it felt like I was marching towards blowing up. HR increased so I backed off a tad. This was a mentally difficult portion as 20km is where the fork is for 1/2 marathon and full. The lakeshore is also wide open and with the lake right there, the winds were really going, with no buildings to block the madness.

**21-28km** was kind of a blur. I didn't really study the course well, some surprise turns but I just followed the crowd. This is kind of no-mans land as well, underneath our main highway/freeway. Still some crowd support, but not the same energy. Felt a little dirty and grimy in that section. This is obviously where the 1/2 marathoners turn off, and I couldn't help but think ""F I'd love to just screw the full and go finish now"". I fell behind the 3:05 pacer but I was feeling pretty good. I was also way off on my tangents, My watch showed 21.4km when I arrived at the physical 21km sign. I'm either running on the outside of the course, GPS was wonky because of the buildings, or a bit of both? (Anyone have insights?). I passed my running partner at about 23km, he looked a little rough, which naturally made me panic as he's faster than me. I questioned if I should stay with him, or go. I caught up and we barely said anything to each other, I remember him just saying ""Go!"" (maybe he didn't say that but my mind was starting to break down). I remember thinking ""I just want to see someone I know in the crowds"" and I tried to visualize it. But alas at I think 25km my bestfriend surprised me and was waiting for me on his bike. It made me quite emotioinal but really picked me up, I had tears in my eyes for the next km.

**28-32km** This is where I asked myself ""what do you want? what do you have left? Do you actually have that BQ in you?"" I know I was a bit ahead on my timing as I banked some time in the first half (NEVER recommend that!). But I could feel fatique setting into my quads and my left glute had some niggles. I decided to just go for it and tried to settle into a 4:25-4:28 pace. I ended up catching up to the 3:05 pacer and quietly tucked myself back in the middle of the group.

**32-40km** The race starts now! I saw my best friend again, and he had facetimed my wife and kids. This was a HUGE boost for me. This area, called Leslieville/Queen East, was ELECTRIC. If there was a neighbourhood for best support of the marathon, they would've been the clear winners. I guess they know this is the grindy part of the race, so they supported the heck out of all of us out there. Also saw a buddy from my run club as a spectator, which was very helpful too. I was hovering between being in the middle of the 3:05 pack, and falling back about 200m. Wasn't very consistent but at this point it was just pure survival. I then saw my bestfriend again at 35km, I remember him saying ""you're almost there!!"" But when I looked up, The CN Tower looked SO far away, and that is where I had to go. Mind went dark and blank, legs were absolutely on fire but I just held on for dear life. I actually convinvced myself I was going to stop, but then I didn't want to lose the 3:05 pacer so I just held on for dear life. I actually started to talk out loud to myself and repeated my kids names over and over and over for at least 3km's in this section.

**40-43km** Peep the 43km, my tangents were so far off I ended up running 42.94km. But again, maybe I didn't, maybe it was the GPS that was really off. At 40km there was a guy that I had been running beside in the 3:05 pack for awhile. I looked at him and just said ""you want to dig in and leave this pacer?"" he nodded and we took off. Well, it felt like we took off but we were only going 4:23 for km41/42. I passed several faster runners who had stopped, trying to stretch out cramped up calves. So of course I started to feel my right calf seizing up and tried to ignore it, thankfully it was OK.The last turn up north is slightly uphill, but we also had the wind at our backs. This is Bay St (Toronto's Wall St), the biggest crowd is naturally at the end. They were quieter than usual and I really needed the energy to get me through the last (bonus) km. So I just yelled at the crowd that I really needed their help and they came through! I sprinted, HR hit 180 at a pace of 3:45 for the final km. Finished, daps and hugs with the guy I ran it in with. And then looked at my phone to see the hundreds of messages from my various friends/family groups cheering me on, making me a little emotional for a minute.

# Post-race:

I tracked my partner right away and he was still on course. I was worried because it showed him 94% done after about 30 mins of me finishing, but it was a glitch in the system and he actually finished with a 3:23:23. He's not unhappy about it, nor is he happy about it. Sometimes it's just not our day. I'm thinking the quick start and the heat got to him early on in the race.

Overall, I am VERY happy with how this race went. I didn't expect it to go so well given the unfavourable conditions and my hacked-together training block. I feel it was near perfect execution even though the theme was ""PANIC"" the entire race! I just want to go to Boston, and I think this may have done it. Have a 6:45+ buffer which I hope is enough, especially with the new downhill penalties. I just signed up for Chicago as well, I didn't even realize it until after the race, Chicago for my age group is guaranteed entry with a sub 3:10.

I'm a little bit upset about the 3:05 pacer, thought getting ahead of him meant I was going to be sub 3:05, I couldn't do the calculations in my head even knowing I was running long. My brain was mush, I couldn't think of anything other than one foot in front of the other. I guess being so new to racing, i'm guessing pacers don't always come in at the time they hope for. I'm just glad I left him at 40km otherwise I likely wouldn't be going to Boston with such a small buffer. I think 3:05 pacer came in at around 3:10. Perhaps me being a tad upset about it is more so greed. I achieved EXACTLY what I wanted to achieve and should have gratitude for that. And in the end of the day, the pacer is a volunteer guide, shouldn't be using them as a goal. I have to run my own race!

I'm glad I had a less than ideal training block, and that the conditions were less than ideal. This gives me a lot of space to imrpove.

Next steps: Stop vaping and smoking weed, more leg strength workouts, better nutrition, follow a proper training block, learn to run efficient tangents. This past marathon got me into Chicago which I've registered for. Goal will be sub 3! l

1odkkdf,Philly Marathon - Spectator Strategy for Out of State Newbs,"hi there, planning on running the philly marathon! very excited, but oddly more stressed about the logistics than the actual race haha. My parents will be driving from out of state. They are not very ""hearty"" (don't walk/stand for too long, don't like the cold) but I would like them to see at least the last part of my race. this is my first marathon and I'm unfamiliar with the course, but would like to give them some guidance on where/how to spectate. my questions 

1. is there anywhere in the last 6 miles that is good for parents to spectate?
2. where should I tell them to park? 
3. how do i figure out my corral/start time so I can give them a good time estimate (ie, expecting to run about 4 hours, with a 7:00 am start time, should i tell them to be at mile 20 around 11:00 am?)
4. if you have similarly non-hearty parents, do you recommend just telling them to skip the spectator and meet up for post-race brunch? do you have any brunch recs in the area that won't be swamped?

1ock43q,"If you had the opportunity to run a self supported marathon anywhere in the US, where would you go?","**Background**: Due to various factors, I would like to run another marathon but don't want to register for an official race.

**Idea**: I can book a short trip anywhere in the US, and run a self supported marathon on my own pace and schedule

**Question**: Where would you run, given this? 

Any 26.2 mile route is a possibility of course, but theres a lot of factors at play:

-Weather: I love to run in the cold, something in the 40-50F range is optimal, so that basically disqualifies the entire South US

-Altitude: I train at altitude, but would love to go down to sea level for free gains

-Elevation gain/loss: 0 is best of course, but I dont mind some small hills as long as it nets out to 0

-Trail: dedicated path is a must, stoplights/non-friendly road crossings are basically a dealbreaker for me. Concrete or packed dirt is preferred

-Route: Out+Back probably the easiest, but a loop or point to point aided by public transit is a super fun idea too

**Some places I've ran that could definitely fit this mold:**

-Chicago Lakefront Path, definitely a classic

-Detroit Riverwalk Trail, probably too short for what I want

-Minneapolis Missippi River trail: definitely qualifies, seems quite long

-Seattles Burke Gilman Trail: more road crossings than I want, but the drivers are very nice there

-San Jose's Guadalupe Trail: not that long, and probably too hot

-Basically any SoCal beachside trail: quite nice, but too warm IMO for a marathon

Any other ideas? I'm not as familiar with the East Coast/Northeast/Midwest, but I'm sure theres the perfect route somewhere in the US for me",1761069726.0,38,78,running,fitness

# About Me

I'm 31M 170 cm tall and weigh about 58.4 kg (or 5'7"" and 128 lbs.) I've been running for about 5 years now. Coming into this race, I set a half-marathon PB of 1:24:56 in April, and I have ambitions of getting my Boston Qualifier time in the next couple of years. My previous marathon PB was 3:38:43 set last year, but this was run conservatively due to hot and humid conditions on race day. As much as I loved my first experience, I always wondered what it’d feel like to run to my limits, and man I got more than I bargained for with this race.

# Training

After an amazing half-marathon result, I rebuilt my base in a couple of months and braced for training. I got up to my usual 100 km (85mi) towards the end, and had a couple long run workouts in there, so I was pretty confident going in. I opted for a 16 week plan that’s based on Jack Daniels’ system of training. I knew that the likely BQ time after cut-offs wasn't going to be realistic, but at the very least I could shoot for sub 3.

This year’s summer was unseasonably warm and humid by Southern Ontario’s standards, and it really started to take its toll. In hindsight, I did a pretty poor job adjusting for the heat and my workouts were consistently very difficult as a result. Nearly all sessions were done in temperatures that felt like 30C (86F) and 88% RH. In addition to that, I was completely unaccustomed to the steady pace (approximately zone 3) runs that the plan had prescribed. And sure enough, during week 6 I started to feel sore, and by week 8 I was injured. My right hip was locking up badly and I could not run.

After doing the 5 stages of grief, I booked a session with my PT. The conclusion we reached was that it was a hip flexor strain. It’d take 2-4 weeks to heal. The timing couldn’t be worse as it coincided with the peak of the training plan. I’d sporadically run during this time, but they were always easy efforts and very low mileages. I just could not produce any power whatsoever from my right side. There was some cross-training, but it definitely was not a substitute for running.

Mentally, it was tough to deal with. Thinking you’re knocking on the 3 hour barrier’s door, and then going to completely sidelined is quite the emotional U-turn. At certain points I debated whether or not it’d be wise to run the race at all.

By week 11, the healing process was steady enough that I started musing about running the race. I coached myself to a sub 1:25 half and I thought I could at least get myself ready to complete the race in 5 weeks. It wouldn’t be a sub 3 or anywhere close to that, but I thought it’d feel worse to miss out. So, I fired up Excel and started writing my own plan. This plan featured an aggressive ramp up from 85 km (52 mi)  / week, to 100 km (62 mi), 130 km (80 mi) and then a 2 week taper. Additionally, I re-tooled my strength training to include weights. I had previously gotten away with only bodyweight exercises, but it was clear that I needed something more for the future.

Full disclosure, I acknowledge that this is incredibly reckless. **I do not recommend this**. I only got away with this because I set a conservative goal. I have experience coaching myself. I’m very familiar with my own training and how my body reacts to it. On any given day I could modify, moderate, or skip a run if needed. Also, I had a fair bit of luck on my side.

Week 1 of 5, my paces were all over the place and my sessions truly humbled me. Paces that I previously considered trivial were now anything but. It stung the ego a bit, but I needed to swallow my pride if this was going to work. Sure enough, I got through week 1 unscathed and my hip flexor strain was rapidly improving. Which means, this is precisely the best time to get sick.

During week 2, I attended a Blue Jays game and must’ve caught something there. Funny enough, I thought the burning in my throat was just caused by some mustard I choked on. The session the next day felt fine, but I finished with a scratchy throat. By the evening I had aches and pains. The surefire signs of a cold or respiratory tract infection.

It was going to be hard to do this with an injury on the mend, but now throwing illness into the mix? I had to dig deep. I was red-lining my body quite a bit, but the infection wasn’t so bad that it prevented me from running. I had fought off much worse in the past. I took a rest day and finished the 100 km (62mi) week off, even running a double day and 30K (18.5 mi) long run session.

Week 3 would test me. It was a 130 km (80 mi) week, more than I had ever done. I had reached 125 km (77 mi) in my half-marathon training, so I reasoned I could do this with much less cumulative fatigue. Still, it was tough going. Double days, mile repeats, and some threshold speed injections in a long run. I knew this was the last week to see any fitness gains, so “make it count” was the motto.

It was here that I decided on my new time goal. Without a race result at my new fitness level to go off of, I couldn’t use the VDot calculator. Runalyze’s prognosis is something I have a love-hate relationship with, but it’s the number I ultimately went with. My A-Goal would be 3:20:00. In the case that my hip flexor wouldn’t allow this, I went with a B-Goal of sub 3:25.

&nbsp;

# Pre-race
I opted for a 2 week taper. The main objective was to let my hip flexor strain fully heal. I moderated some of the more difficult efforts and reduced my easy mileage substantially. Week 4 had an overall mileage of 85 km (52 mi), and week 5 had about 45km (27 mi,) excluding the marathon. A bit less than I’d usually do, but I figured that the minimal amount of hay I had was already in the barn. The priority now was recovery while keeping things sharp. It was a very fine balancing act that I ultimately got right. My running economy was improving and my paces began to return to normal. I also threw in some steady paced efforts to get a feel for the pace I had chosen. The last remnants of the illness would dissipate during this time.

2 days out from the race, I started to carbload. About 8.5g per kilo of my bodyweight per day. I usually go a bit lighter with the loading phase, because I sleep considerably worse if I over do it.

For my shakeout, I had a couple Ks of warm up, 3K of marathon pace work, and some cool down. The pace felt difficult, but definitely not impossible. More importantly though, I wore what I had on at my first marathon. A new PB was all but guaranteed since I ran that one so conservatively, but it was also a reminder of the progress I’d made in a year.

# Race

I woke up at 4:00 AM, asking myself why the hell I got into this hobby. I had my usual breakfast, 2 PB&J bagels and about 380 mL of black coffee. I arrived about an hour before start time to account for the large crowd. After running my warm up, I realized there wasn’t enough time to use the washrooms before getting into the corrals. The barricades and dense crowds meant I couldn’t go. I kicked myself for this, but it was what it was. I decided to use the first one I saw on the race course, since most folks would’ve gone already and it wouldn’t be too punishing to stop early on in the race.

Conditions for the day were a temperature range of 17 to 21C (62.6f to 69.8f) with winds between 21 kph (13 mph) to 30 kph (18 mph.) The gusts were 30 kph (18 mph) to 50 kph (31 mph.) Not ideal at all. I was hoping for rain to help cool things down, but it wasn’t to be. Thankfully the wind was coming mostly from the south and would only be a true headwind for a few sections of the race.

I started getting into my own head a bit. Aside from the weather, running after coming back from an injury and being undertrained was going to be a challenge. I started to have some doubts. What if my hip flexor gave out again? What if I couldn’t hold the pace? 5 weeks isn’t enough time, what was I thinking?

Then, someone nudged me out of my thoughts. To my complete and utter surprise, this guy recognized me from my YouTube channel. Which isn’t big at all. With a modest 30 subscribers, and most viewed video having some 500 views, I’m definitely not internet famous on Running YouTube. We exchanged pleasantries and he was on his way. That was enough to snap me out of my mental funk. I was ready to give this race all I had.


&nbsp;

At 8:00 AM we were off. The first section of the race was a slight uphill on Yonge Street before turning westbound on Bloor Street. I had previously filmed a 10K race on this stretch of road, so it was like saying hello to an old friend. I set off at pace until the 3K aid station where I took a quick toilet break. Like I had predicted, the portapotties were available. However, this set me behind pace by about a minute. I’d push to finish the third kilometre at 5:08/km pace. I was in a deficit of about 15 seconds. Something that I’d quickly make up for in the next two kilometres.

As I was making my way down Bathurst Street, I began playing with paces a bit. While 4:30/km (7:15/mi) felt a little too much, 4:35-4:40/km (7:23-7:31/mi) felt much better than I thought it would. So I opted for that level of effort instead. If there was a section that was being difficult, I’d fall back to the target of 4:45/km (7:39/mi.)

The race then took us down by Fort York, a preserved 18th century military installation, before bringing us to the titular waterfront the marathon takes its name from. Lakeshore Boulevard has a fantastic view of Lake Ontario. The sun peaked out, tinting the clouds orange as strong winds crashed dark waves on the breakwater.

Speaking of the wind, it was truly hitting me now. In the downtown areas, some of the buildings provided cover, and Bathurst was a slight downhill, but on the lakeshore, there was nothing. I couldn’t help but smile a bit. I had defied warm weather and crosswinds separately at Mississauga. Now it was all about putting those lessons together.

At aid stations, I’d opt to splash water over myself at the first table and mostly drink Nuun at the second. With the winds gusting, this worked well to provide the much needed cooling. Especially since the aid stations were placed every 3K.


&nbsp;

We made our loop at Lakeshore Boulevard to swing back towards the city and under the Gardiner Expressway. Although my Garmin’s GPS was relatively reliable, it was here where it unraveled. Because the Gardiner is an overhead highway with Lakeshore boulevard directly underneath, most GPSs will get confused. It’s happened so many times to me when using Google Maps.

My watch went haywire on the 20th kilometre and the alert sounded well in advance of the marker. I had been keeping a very rough track of how much time I was missing from not running the course 100% to the tangents. Using the difference between the Garmin lap alert and me crossing the physical marker gave me a rough idea. Now I was flying blind and the alerts were sounding off hundreds of metres ahead of where they were.

I decided to not think too much about it and just try to stick to my target pace. I knew I was already up a bit in terms of time due to running faster than expected. The GPS wasn’t likely to malfunction again until the final stretch in the downtown area.

The Toronto Waterfront Marathon isn’t a hilly course by any means, but there were definitely some inclines on the eastbound stretch out to The Beaches that didn’t feel great, but for every stretch that didn’t feel great, there were two or three where I felt like I was skating across the road. It was here I also caught sight of the 3:20 pace group. I started a couple minutes behind them, so I knew if I was on top of them I was making my objective by about that much.

&nbsp;

Despite the good news, trouble was brewing. I felt my right calf start to get a little tighter. The early warning signs of a cramp. The wind and heat was affecting me more than I thought it would. In light of that, I decided to take my only caffeine gel later on after the 30K mark, rather than the planned 25K. In addition to hydrating more, I increased my cadence and slightly reduced my stride length. Aside from a 189 spm looking like a very comical shuffle at my pace, this took the edge off the cramp.

After what seemed like an eternity, I reached the turn around point on Queen Street East and Balsam Avenue. The downhill back felt considerably better. I had a little check in with myself and realized I had quite a bit of gas left in the tank. It was time to do a little negative split for the last 4K.

I stepped on the gas and ramped up to 4:29/km (7:13/mi) and it felt great. The caffeine had really kicked in by now and I was locked in. I flew across the Eastern Avenue bridge and ramped up to 4:23/km (7:03/mi,) making my way back downtown. With some cover from the wind, I took the next kilometre at 4:22/km (7:02/mi.) Then there was the final stretch.

Up until this point I had been running with music, but most of it was being drowned out by the cheering crowds. But, there was a small section where no one was standing where the most crucial song I had chosen for the last leg of the race was audible. One Final Effort from the Halo 3 soundtrack. Hearing those opening piano chords was like electricity. The sections of the song that appeared during the game’s final warthog run signalled it was time to finish the fight. Against a final uphill, I went all out, touching my 10K race pace and launching myself through the finish line.

# Post-race

Upon finishing, I was proud of what I had just done. I just took some 20 minutes off my previous marathon PB in some less than ideal conditions. I felt like I had accomplished what I set out to do, to run a marathon to my absolute limit. And I got that confirmed immediately, because after I crossed the finish line and stopped, my right calf cramped up. My left leg, having had enough of my right’s antics for the past couple of years, decided to go on strike, refusing to support my full bodyweight, and just like that I was flat on my butt.

The medical team were immediately on me fearing the worst. It was hot that day and we were taking casualties all race long. Looking back at the finish line footage, I also saw that the gentleman right behind me stopped to make sure my head didn’t hit the pavement. It wasn’t a real risk, but the gesture is still incredibly kind.

I sheepishly told the medics that it was just a cramp. I couldn’t really walk though, so they wheeled me off to the side. After a hundred metres or so, the medic asked me if I wanted to go to the medical tent. My leg wasn’t perfect, but I tried standing on it, and it was good enough to limp on, and I was on my way, medal in tow. My mind set on one place. Vancouver.

### Training

After a rough 2024 with limited running due to bursitis in my left foot, I played it safe and planned a 20 week build for this (my first) marathon.  I'm no stranger to half marathon races -- I've raced 27 of them, but I knew this would be beyond any training I'd ever done before. AND IT WAS. I loosely followed a detailed plan I made via chatgpt but also harnessed the information in the book Advanced Marathoning, help from friends with marathon experience, etc. to assist me along the way. I tried to prioritize the long run above everything else and hoped that my experience with half marathons, alongside some quicker workouts throughout could help me finish AT LEAST sub 4 in Toronto.

Usually I'm a three times a week runner, and to prepare for half marathons, running only 40 km/week.  I'm F35 and pretty fit, with regular cross training on a weekly basis.  That was my baseline when I started the 20 week build for the Toronto Waterfront Marathon in approximately June??  In May, I ran a half marathon personal best of 1:37 and a 10k in 41:52 --both in Toronto, which gave me some confidence to try for a decent time when I started the build. Both of those races I did on limited running due to my recovering foot and dealing with lingering pain after longer runs.  I also ran Around The Bay 30k in March and had a great race even in poor weather conditions.  Initially I set my goal time for the marathon at 3:45 but that goal kept creeping lower as the summer progressed and my Garmin / runalyze predictions dropped.

Over the 20 weeks, I slowly increased my mileage, running further every week than I'd ever run in my life, creeping ever closer to 100km/week which I thought would be a cool milestone to reach -- if only for this one marathon build.  During peak week, I got up to 102km and was completely burnt out from all the running I was doing.  It felt like all I was doing was running and neglecting cross training, my family, etc. which was certainly challenging, but I could see the end in sight. 

My weeks usually consisted of a weekend long run, some easy/chatty group runs with my local running shop that were between 5-7km and a speed workout.  There were also  days where I ran in the morning and in the evening with the group runs because I needed additional mileage and had to fit it in. Fortunately I didn't suffer any injuries or setbacks throughout the 20 weeks, and only took a small break from running for a week of summer vacation. I was very fortunate with my health during this period. 

My plan had me running 5 or 6 days a week and trying to get in at least one strength workout in the gym alongside a pilates, spin or cross training class of some sort.  Often those cross training workouts were just helpful to break up all the running and change it up. A mental break of sorts. This felt doable for a long time until early September when I just wanted training to be over. 

Over the course of the 20 weeks, I did 4 LONG runs of 30k+. 2 @ 30k, one 34k and a run of 33k three weeks before the marathon. These certainly helped me maintain my speed throughout the 42.2k yesterday. It also helped that all my training was during the summer here in Ontario, Canada so yesterday's unseasonably warm October weather wasn't a total race killer. I also completed a half marathon while on vacation in San Francisco at the end of July. It was a hilly course and I ran 1:39 while taking all sorts of photos and videos while we traversed the city, Golden Gate Bridge, etc.  That also gave me confidence because I didn't taper, carb load or adjust my vacation plans before or after that race and still felt great! 2 weeks prior to the race, I also raced a 5k (to the dismay of some running friends who suggested against it) and finished JUST over 20 mins without too much effort. 5ks aren't really my thing, but it still felt good to run fast and finish with a time I was proud of just before the important race (marathon day). 

 

### Pre-race

3 week taper leading into the marathon following peak week. 70k/50k/27k+marathon. I started carb loading on the Thursday before Sunday's race with some swaps for protein dishes in favour of bagels, white rice, candy.  Truth be told, I already enjoy lots of carbs, so it wasn't a hard sell for me. 

Drove into Toronto on Saturday and hit up the expo for all the freebies and my bib. Probably walked too many steps (17k) but was off my feet by 7pm after a delicious chicken souvlaki meal for dinner. Sipped on some electrolytes in the evening and took some melatonin to help me get to sleep as early as possible at the hotel.  Unfortunately my room was next door to a hockey party room, so it wasn't a great sleep but I made do after a phone call to security at midnight to settle the guys next door. 

I set my alarm for 5:15am and trecked to Tim Hortons near the hotel for 2 bagels and a coffee. Felt good to take a little walk but it was already warm out which was disappointing when you're expecting a cool October morning for race day.  I sipped on more electrolytes and ALMOST finished both bagels but not quite. Two bagels is double what I normally eat before a half marathon and I already have a nervous stomach before races, so I felt confident that two bagels would probably be fine for MY BODY to start the marathon.  During training, I also frequently went out for long runs on an empty stomach or almost empty, and relied on gels/nutrition to get me by so I figured my body was served well by two bagels on race morning.

I braided my hair, put on some facial glitter for good race vibes and got the kit on to get out the door by 7:35am. I was fortunate to get a free bib from TCS - one of the main sponsors of the race, via a contest for teachers so we took a quick group photo and I was on my way. They had a grab and go breakfast for runners, shuttle to start line, etc. but I had my own plan so I stuck with that and just enjoyed the free food POST-RACE.

From my hotel, I jogged to the (new for this year due to construction) start line and no lie, GOT SHIT ON BY A BIRD before heading into the corral. I guess it was good luck.  Cleaned myself off with water, sung O' Canada in the corral, found my 3:25 pace bunny and was off a few minutes after they released the elites!

### Race

Latched myself onto the 3:25 pacer and just enjoyed the ride. I'm incredibly lucky and had close friends, family, and strava peeps who were spectating the race and told me where they'd be on course.  I told my inner circle that I really needed them in the second half of the race and they SHOWED UP. They bussed, ran, subway-ed, etc. to find me (& other friends) along the route. 

The first half of this race has such good energy through the city and onto Lakeshore Blvd and I knew what to expect as a runner who's done the half many times. This year was no different -- arguably better because the warm weather made it perfect weather for spectators to stay out all day.  21k flew by and before I knew it, we were separating ourselves from the half marathoners on Bay Street and making our way to The Beaches in Toronto. 

The course loops around a ton between 22k and 30k before you hit Woodbine Park. For some of it, we were on cobblestones which I didn't enjoy and seemed to fall a bit behind the 3:25 pacer before we connected with the smooth road again where I was able to catch up. There's some narrow roadways from 24k-27k?? where it's multiuse trail and runners moving in both directions. As a first timer, I don't know if this is the usual course or just this year but I wasn't a huge fan. Some runners slowing down at this point and narrow roads made it challenging to move past them as a small pace group. 

The road opens up again after 27/28k and it was smooth sailing from then on. Good crowd support again out in The Beaches which was a big boost of energy that I needed at that time. I also saw my parents at 31k and knew I'd see them again on the way back for gatorade, water and/or gel that I'd given them the night before.

At 35k, I saw my parents on route for the second time, grabbed a Gatorade from them and separated myself from the pacer. I felt strong and I knew I'd want more than a 5 min buffer if I wanted to give myself every opportunity to BQ for 2027. People were struggling with the heat at this point in the race but I kept pushing the pace, reminding myself how many times I've run 7k, 6k, 5k, etc. I had my music playing and was trying to smile and take it all in. I was going to finish my first marathon and likely hit my goal. It felt good. 

Saw a friend at 39k whose energy is unmatched and he gassed me up while running alongside me for probably 500m. Big mood boost and put a big smile on my face for that final stretch. Saw another pair of local friends who'd come out to cheer for everyone from our local running group at 41k ish and one of them ran alongside me as well, saying how proud they were, that I was crushing it -- all the things to help me keep on the gas for the final little hill up Bay Street toward Toronto City Hall to the finish. 

I looked at my watch when I turned onto Bay St., (maybe like 300/400m left) did some quick math & figured I could run sub 3:23 if I just gave a little bit more for the final stretch. 

For the first half of the race, I felt amazing and had no stomach issues at all. I took 2 cups of water and nuun at every aid station and took a gel every 40 mins as well.  I also carried salt tabs with me that I used until about 32k when they started to make me so nauseous I stopped taking them. The salt tabs I ate between aid stations. Initially I wasn't going to carry them, and just rely on gels, but it was so warm I thought it was better to have them than not. 

In total, I brought 7 gels with me but I think I only finished 5 of them. I also picked up two GU gels that the race provided (they give out a total of 3 during the marathon). I finished one of the GUs and put the other one in my shorts, but didn't take it. For me, this was enough nutrition  to get through while also not upsetting my stomach too much. I felt hydrated enough and with lots of energy through to the finish line. Never hit a wall, cramped, felt delirious, etc. 


### Post-race

Complete shock. I thought I'd be in tears immediately but I think I was in disbelief that I'd finished so well and was finally done.  Looped around through the finisher's shute and met up with a close running friend of mine who's currently pregnant, but wanted to enjoy the race day vibes as a spectator.  I saw her and immediately sobbed in her arms. 

I grabbed the free food available (didn't eat any of it) and then waited for some buddies to finish to take some pictures. My body felt a little stiff but overall really good, and I was on a big high. My legs are a little chafed, but otherwise I came out of the race unscathed. I wore Puma Nitro Elite 3s that served my feet well, a bandit crop tank with tons of pockets for gels, my phone, health card (just in case), room key, and salt tabs, as well as a pair of lululemon wundertrain shorts with additional pockets. 


Last night and this morning, my left side is feeling sore but otherwise I'm okay. Happy to enjoy lots of good food and rest today while I gear up to cheer on the Toronto Bluejays for Game 7 tonight! I plan to rest until the end of the week and MAYBE try a very easy run on the weekend but I'm going to see how I feel.  

I have a half marathon race November 2, so the goal is just to feel recovered enough to jog that if I have to.  If I feel good, maybe faster.

A dream come true race on the streets of Toronto yesterday! Praying to all the running gods that the 2027 BQ buffer is less than 7:37 (I think I'm safe).

1obj5tp,Will I be fine running tempo/threshold instead of endurance for long runs?,"Hey y'all, so I started running this year and it's been going pretty well, been working out a lot trying to just get into running and definitely feel like it's getting easier and I'm getting fitter but I can't for the love of me run in endurance pace. I'm 29M and weigh about 78kg and my endurance pace usually forces me to run at a 6-6:30km/min pace, I read that keeping it in z2 minimizes injuries but honestly it just makes my legs feel worse than when running at a faster pace (which I actually prefer).

My weekly training routine consists of interval training (usually 600m x 7-8 at a pace under 4km/min) and a longer run (15-21km at a slower pace trying to keep my pulse a bit lower, usually anywhere from 148-170 average), and sometimes I try pushing for a PR (goal is sub20 5k and sub40 10k (if im in good form)).

I read from many sources that z2 is just not worth it before you have built up a steady base, I base my information off garmin and strava which says that my max pulse is 191, last time I ran a HM at 5:05 pace my average pulse was 170 which was fine and didn't make me feel more tired than if I would've ran slower.

Now the question is should I just listen to my body and keep running at a faster pace, even if it puts me in tempo+threshold zones or it this detrimental to my improvement? I just want to maximize my effectiveness while actually running since I work nights and have limited free time.

# Training

I've been training most of the year using a phone app. I moved from the “42k runner” app to Runna and preferred its structure despite being initially skeptical of its algorithmically generated workouts. I think my experience training for a half marathon previously, and the reading etc. I had done helped me understand what the app was asking of me, and where required, listen to my body and modify my schedule. I think it is risky for injury trusting an app alone. I made keeping my cadence at around 180spm a focus this year and it greatly helped me.

Most significantly, I missed 2 weeks with a bad flu, so swapped the first pre-marathon de-load week with the final big mileage week of the workout, so I didn’t go from a 2 week break immediately to 33k long run! This worked well and I was able to practice my fueling and hydration strategy on my last 2 long runs.  Strength training could have been more consistent, I noticed the impact when I started doing it and foam rolling regularly during the week and wish I had started sooner. I do love long runs and really enjoyed getting to run on Sunday afternoons, particularly admiring all the wattle that blooms in Melbourne in August.

I quite liked having race pace sections in my longer long run, where I discovered a slightly quicker pace actually felt more comfortable in many ways.

Taper went well and I did some deliberate carb loading for the first time. On race morning, my legs felt fresh and ready, and I was not too full either. Pre race meal was porridge and rhubarb with a black coffee 2h prior

# The Race

It was a fresh morning perfect running weather, got to start line at 6am for 6:30am start time. Started with the 4:30 pace group, but since I was carrying my own electrolyte drink (Rhise salted watermelon - which I very much like) in my Nathan running belt, I decided to continue on when the group slowed for the drink station to create some buffer for when I had to stop to refill the bottles midway. Refilling was a bit clunky but worked, I prefer to take more regular, shorter drinks.

Had to resist the urge to go too fast at kms 10 - 20km, and hoped I hadn’t gone out too fast after leaving the pacers behind, I was having a lot of fun!

I fueled every 6k as recommended with Maurten gels, regular Gel 100@at 6, 12, 24 and 36k, Caf 100 at 18k and 30k. Keeping my consistent pace rolling felt good, my watch died at km 28 and so had to trust myself from then on. Fortunately, given the age of my watch, I had mentally prepared myself for the possibility so I wasn't thrown off. I continued to move along quite happily, with the uphill requiring a bit of self talk to ""keep the machine moving"" every now and then, and then transitioning back to fun mode. Certain signs and spectators really boosted my feeling with wholesomeness and humour, which I had underestimated the impact of! Shout out to the grandma I saw on Beaconsfield Pde being an awesome supporter.

At around km 37 I didn’t hit “the wall” but got an odd stiffness in my left leg on the outer back of the knee, it didn’t hurt but surprised me and I wasn’t sure what to do with it or if it was risky, seeing the odd person being loaded into an ambulance at this stage as well also was a bit of a freak out. The 4:30 group caught up, and as I worked to stay with them and found picking up my pace helped get rid of the feeling so it was onwards to the finish line, which I crossed 30sec ahead of my target time!

# Post Race

Crossed the finish line and as I stopped everything seized for a moment, so I kept putting one foot in front of the other slowly in a slight duck walk, and the sense I could walk properly came back! Wasn’t feeling especially tired at all in a cardio sense just usual long run stuff, which indicates to me strength is really my limiting factor for more speed. We had to walk down and later up a 45 degree ramp for our medals and t shirt 🥲 0/10 do not recommend. Stairs also followed to the event village for bathrooms and reuniting with friends in what I can only assume was some kind of cosmic joke 😅

Got home (via my friends scooting into the store for a bag of party ice on my behalf) and had a 10min ice bath, picked up a tip from pro dancer friend and did this in a garbage bag to avoid direct skin contact with the ice water and allowing me to wear compression pants and warm socks. Then into recovery slides and feet up after a post run meal. In the end I found it was better to keep gently moving around! Next day was able to walk to work and did a good foam roll in the morning, and felt pretty much as I would after a long run!

Keen to work on increasing my speed for next year’s races! I hope reading this is relatable, reflecting on my experience, the advice out there on cadence, strength training and practicing your fueling, hydration etc. do really help.

I am thinking about getting into running, but am a little apprehensive as I have not really ran in like a decade, and even then it was for football and not pure running.

I am also in the midst of losing weight and have already lost nearly 40 pounds this year (263 down to 225) with weightlifting and calorie deficit… but my cardiovascular endurance is still not great. As much as I love having lost the weight, I want to be much more athletic and have much more endurance for things like hiking and sports (basketball and soccer).

How should I go about getting started assuming “running” endurance is not high at all, and I still want to prioritize caloric defect as I have some food addiction issues that I have designed my diet to help with.

I’ve gotten the pre run breakfast in the bag so that’s a tick but I really struggle with the feeling during. I had a gel before we started and then one half an hour in but that one hit my stomach wrong and felt I couldn’t take another in case I vomited which might have possibly been why I completely bonked at about mile 10 and I was too worried about having any of the sweets people were handing out. I managed to dig deep and got myself a PB but I have a full marathon I’m hoping to do next year and will obviously need to fuel myself better.

Heat index is in the mid 90s right now and 77% humidity and I attempted 5x800 meters at 5k pace at the track… I got in 3 before I felt like I wanted to puke. I’ve been doing speed on the tread all summer because of the heat. I’m currently training to get into Boston so, the speed work is FAST and HARD. 

I’m at a loss of if I should keep doing speed on the treadmill until it finally cools down (November/December) or if doing it indoors v outdoors is a disservice to my goals? Feeling frustrated ",1759966072.0,26,34,running,fitness
1o1a56f,Tis the Season! Time for the Annual cold / cool / winter weather running and gear thread,"Now that Winter is quickly approaching (in the Northern Hemisphere, at least), it seems we are are getting more winter/cold weather posts which means it is time for the annual Winter Megathread.

[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/weather#wiki_winter.2Fcold) the link for the cold weather info in our wiki.  I will add this post to that at a later date.  If you happen to be in the Southern Hemisphere and entering the season of the big fiery death ball in the sky, [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/weather/) the link to the ""Running in the Heat"" section of the wiki .

**Why should I run in the winter?**

* Winter running makes you strong!

* That person you really want to beat next year is out there training right now

* Spring weather feels so much better when you’ve been training through the winter


**Clothing**

You’re going to want materials that will keep you warm even when damp or wet. Think wool, fleece, and wicking synthetics. You’ll also want things to be breathable so you don’t get super sweaty (and even colder).  Layer up so you can adjust during your run.

Trapped air is what keeps you warm and cozy in the winter. If your shoes are really tight with a couple pairs of socks on, or your gloves/mittens are too tight, you may have less trapped air and impair circulation, which will make you cold.

Here’s an example of what works well for some in calm, dry conditions. Keep in mind wind or precipitation will make things colder, and that it’s always better to have an extra layer than to make do without.  This can also vary widely between people and how comfortable you want to be.  Use the table as a guide to layering suggestions factoring in how fast/slow you are running (for generating body heat) as well as how hot/cool natured you normally are.

**Temp Range**|**Upper**|**Lower**|**Socks**|**Hands**|**Head**
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
30 to 40F (-1 to 5C)|Long-sleeve (LS) shirt|Shorts or light pants|regular socks|Light gloves|headband
20 to 30F (-6 to -1C)|LS shirt + baselayer|Regular tights|1x midweight wool|Light gloves|headband
10 to 20F (-12 to -6C)|LS Baselayer + wind vest|Thermal tights + windbriefs|2x midweight wool|Mittens|Hat + light gator
0 to 10F (-18 to -12C)|LS Baselayer + Fleece jacket + Wind jacket or vest|Thermal tights + windbriefs + leggings|2x heavier wool socks|Heavy mittens|heavy hat, fleece balaclava, eye protection
<0 F (<-18 C)|LS Baselayer + Fleece jacket + Wind jacket|Thermal tights + windbriefs + leggings|2x heavier wool socks|Heavy mittens w/ gloves underneath|heavy hat x2, fleece balaclava, eye protection (glasses or goggles, if windy)

Here are some useful links to some guides that can help you choose appropriate amount of clothing:

[Dress My Run Website - Quick tool to show what to wear based on where you live and weather](http://dressmyrun.com/)

* Click on ""Settings"" in the bottom right hand corner to adjust your personal temperature preference (warmer or cooler)

**Footwear**

Road shoes are fine most of the time, unless you're running somewhere that consistently has snow or ice-covered sidewalks. If you have good socks, your feet should stay warm even if damp from melting snow. Think more carefully about your footwear if there’s snow or ice on the ground.
On fresh snow or packed, but still soft snow, trail shoes (something with a low to moderate lug) work very well.  [Turning an old pair of road shoes into Screw Shoes](https://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/running-shoe-screws) is an excellent idea for ice, thawed and refrozen snow, and heavily packed snow conditions – the screws do a great job providing a bit of extra traction.

You can also look into traction devices (like Yaktrax) when icy.

When running, direction changes and stopping are the most likely times to slip and fall on snow or ice. Slow down and be cautious around corners and street crossings. As you run, make sure you’re landing with your feet underneath your center of mass – even if you do have a slippery step, keep your feet moving, and you can usually recover and avoid a fall.

**Safety**

If you work during the day, chances are your morning or evening run will be dark. Get yourself a good headlamp (to see and be seen), and wear a reflective vest over your other clothing. Know that motorists may be less likely to expect you to be out running when it’s 15 degrees and snowing.

If it's really cold, make adjustments or plans to ensure you can stay safe during your run even if you turn an ankle or something else happens where you can't keep running to stay warm. Plan your route along safe warm zones (friend's house, grocery stores, etc.), and/or carry your cell phone (close to your body, so your battery doesn't die). If you for some reason can't run, you will quickly get very chilled.  [Here's](https://www.weather.gov/bou/windchill) a Windchill Safety chart from the National Weather Service to help determine when things might be too dangerous to run or if you do, to take extra safety precautions.

Start your runs into the wind - this will be the coldest part - so that your finish your runs with a warmer tailwind. This can make a big difference - if you get sweaty during your run, and turn into a stiff breeze to finish, you're likely to get chilled as you're heading home.

Here's a good post on [Running in snow tips..?](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/zj8zhw/running_in_snow_tips/)



**Nutrition**

Even when it’s cold out, you’ll want to be sure you’re hydrated before and during long runs. You’re probably sweating more than you might think, it will evaporate quickly in cold dry air. Have a method to keep fluids from freezing when it’s cold out, either by keeping fluids under a layer of clothing (vest or hydration pack), planning a route around accessible water, or figuring out a way to keep your handheld from freezing up.

Gels and other foods can freeze too – tuck these items into a glove or mitten a few minutes before you want to eat, to thaw them out and warm them up.

This concerns me for several reasons, but largely bottlenecks on course around water stations causing accidents / delays to runners, runners not being able to get water if they need it (due to crowding, or if they have dropped their reusable cup/bottle and not noticed) and also asking runners to have to physically stop each time they want water.

But lately he’s been pushing us to go faster. I get that it’s good to improve, but honestly, I’m miserable at that faster pace and it just makes me want to quit. Today I slowed it down and actually enjoyed the run and I went for longer than usual and felt proud of myself, but then all he did was complain it was too slow and said he can’t run that slow.

Now I feel kind of deflated instead of happy about my progress, but I do want to get better so should I suck it up and try to push the pace, or just focus on being able to run the full 5km without stopping first and worry about speed later? ",1759786742.0,168,120,running,fitness

1nz4xfo,What are your tips for doing races on the beach/on sand?,"I'm doing a half marathon on the beach (in Gold Coast, Aus) in November. I've done lots of road races but haven't done any beach races before (and haven't really run on the beach much in general) so I'm keen for some tips from people who've done them before. It's an out and back course, starting at 7am in late spring (i.e. temperatures at race time will likely be 20C, humid, and warming up throughout the race, with sunrise happening before 5am). Reading about it, it looks like it's on hard sand / done near the water.

Specifically wondering about:

* Road shoes versus trail shoes?
* Any other gear recommendations from people who've done beach races before? (e.g. certain type of socks to deal with the sand and potential water from waves?) And in that level of heat/humidity as well, given it's along the beach - any thoughts on split shorts vs half-tights, and tank top vs shirtless?
* Pacing - my HM PB is 1:31 so not sure how I should adjust my pace. Not looking to PB but keen to give it a decent crack.
* And open to any other tips

On the last day of summer, I ran the Canada Army Run 10k in Ottawa. Meant as a rust-buster and gauge of where my legs are at, things went way better than expected and left me with lots to reflect on as I begin to map out the next year of fitness.

**Training**

I went into this race with fairly minimal expectations, in part because I haven’t done any run-specific training since the spring. I was physically and mentally wiped after the Ottawa Half-Marathon in May and needed a break from intense running work. I pivoted to cycling for most of the summer, with running mainly serving as cross-training – easy runs only (with the occasional long easy run thrown in). From May to September, my weekly volume was anywhere from 6km to 25km – all of it easy – with bike volume ranging from 140km/week to 280km/week. I did one quality session last weekend (6x1km threshold) to get the legs used to fast running again.

**The Course**

Canada Army Run starts at the usual Ottawa race starting blocks (on Laurier between City Hall and Confederation Park) and ends at the National War Memorial at the intersection of Elgin and Wellington about a block east of Parliament. I last ran the Army Run in 2022 (a then-PB of 46:4x) and this year’s course was broadly similar: the [10k course](https://www.racepoint.ca/maps/armyrun.html) goes out-and-back on Wellington, then down Sussex Dr. before circling back at the grounds of Rideau Hall and heading back downtown. It’s similar to the back half of this past spring’s Half course. On Sunday, the first 5k were a net downhill and the back 5k a net uphill.

Given the lack of run-specific training since May, this was a tough one to figure out how to pace. My bike legs felt *really* good through the summer, but I was somewhat unsure of how that would translate to running. Based on the 1km threshold repeats a week ago, I settled on a plan to go out at 4:33-4:35/km and then make pacing decisions in the back half based on how the legs felt. On Saturday, I decided to be a little bolder: stick with the 45:00 pacers until I got dropped, then go from there. I went in with little to no pressure, but with an informal yardstick that I’d be pleased with anything faster than 45:30.

**Race**

Woke up at 6am, ate pre-race breakfast, and took the LRT to my office (which is just across from the start area) to change and drop my bag at my desk. The 5k was running past me as I exited the building shortly after 8. Did around 3km of warmup with a few race pace pickups, then found my way to the first race corral with the 45min pacers. The weather was perfect: +8 at the startline with enough of a breeze to cool you off, but not enough to feel like you were fighting crosswinds.

Things were delayed a few minutes from the planned 8:45 start, but the starting howitzer (not a typo) went off for the first corral a little before 8:50. We got up to speed quickly and set to work with a pace group of around 30 runners. The opening km of the 5k and 10k are always a little frantic as folks try to escape crowding, and we split it a bit faster than intended (4:17). Got into a really good rhythm in the section up and down Wellington, then kept it going through the descent towards the Chateau Laurier and the National Gallery on Sussex (4:27/4:25/4:21/4:29 for the next 4k). Things were feeling solid at the halfway split (22:10) – way better than I’d expected. We slowed a little in the false flats through and around the Rideau Hall grounds (4:30/4:26) and back onto Sussex to head to the finishing stretch (4:29). The road turned north to head back to downtown, and we found ourselves running smack into a headwind. The group had been steadily whittling down since Rideau Hall; when we hit the headwind, it quickly disintegrated.

In past 10k races, I’ve had a bad habit of cracking in the penultimate km; even when I’ve been able to dial it back in for the final km, it’s reliably been my slowest split – by a healthy margin - in the last three 10ks I’ve run. Between the late race fatigue, the false flat, and the headwind, I was rapidly running out of matches and could see runners dropping from the group around me. I kept waiting for the crack to happen, and…it didn’t. Split that km 4:32 – the slowest of the race so far, but not aggressively so.

The final boss of this race is a brute: From Sussex, the race turns back onto Wellington and ascends a 250m kicker to the finish at the war memorial. It’s a 5% gradient from the turn until about 10m before the finish line. I’ve done the Army Run twice before this one (one 5k and one 10k) and have watched countless runners completely fall apart on that finishing hill. The pacer nearest me called out “get ready to hurt!” as we made the turn, and hurt it did. A productive summer of getting my legs ripped off on grouprides came in handy: if there’s one thing I know how to do, it’s smash out a 45-second effort deep into the red after a long period at threshold. I very nearly puked with about 40m to go but managed to keep it together and cross the line. Chip clocked in at 44:3x: my third sub-45, my second-fastest 10k ever, and only 12s short of my PB.

**Post-race**

I was *vibrating* as I walked through the finishing area to grab my medal, electrolytes, and post-race snack. If you’d asked me pre-race what a “great race” would look like, I’d have said somewhere in the 45:00-45:15 range. I’d planned to stay with the 45min pacer until they dropped me; instead, I crossed the line one second ahead of them. After spending the summer not focused on running, having mid-44 in the legs was not on my radar *at all*. It was also the smoothest race I’ve ever run: no ninth km blowup, no feed zone mishaps, no aggressively positive splits (22:10 and 22:2x). The thought that kept coming into my head the rest of the day was “oh, so that’s what it feels like when you finally put it all together”. I’m still riding the post-race high.

It also has me thinking about the future and perhaps needing to adjust some of my near-term running goals. The tentative plan for 2026 is to prioritize the 10k distance for the spring (and use that block to test whether I have the durability to survive a plan that peaks in the 60-70km/week range) before taking another swing at 1:40 at the Toronto Waterfront Half in the fall. A week ago, I’d planned to set sub-44 as a 10k goal for the spring, but if I’m at the point where I can knock out a mid-44 on low + easy running volume and bike training alone, I think I need to reassess what an ambitious-yet-realistic goal looks like. I also need to reflect on how I mentally approach goal races: I felt *way* less stressed going into this race, and I think the lack of internal pressure helped me run a smoother, better, faster race.

### Training
I am marathon training and this is 4 weeks out; the schedule calls for a 8-15K tune-up race so I am pushing it a bit but never mind!

### Pre-race
Those with long memories may recall that I [ran this last year](https://old.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1fmwn2r/winchester_half_marathon_22nd_sept_2024/) and was excited to beat 1:45 – my time last year was 1:40:48 and I commented that I might have been able to catch the 1:40 pacers but only with “a titanic effort.”

Fast forward 12 months and I think I am a bit faster; this time I want to be sub-1:40.

The course is beautiful and starts and finishes in the historic city of Winchester, adorned with a cathedral that is in parts over 900 years old. It is also hilly; the first 3K or so is all uphill, following which it is undulating but includes another steep climb in the village of Oliver’s Battery, the segment for which on Strava is named “Drained battery.”

I arrived at the race village around 1 hour before the 9:00am start time; there were people around but it was strangely quiet. There had been an incident on the motorway, which was therefore closed, and the race was delayed by at least 30 minutes, in part because of delayed runners but also because key traffic marshals were stuck in the traffic and without their presence the race could not go ahead. There were even whispers that the race might be cancelled; road closures are difficult to manage at the best of times, everything has to be pre-approved by the authorities and if the race missed its time window it might have to be abandoned.

The weather was perfect, everything was set up, and runners milled around feeling a bit glum. It is odd to prepare oneself for a race, have an early breakfast and warm-up run, and then … nothing. I began to feel hungry; the plan was to do the race and have a second breakfast afterwards, but I did not want to eat again before running. 

After 45 minutes or so there was some good news. The race would go ahead, the start time would be sometime after 10:00am. I had a chat with the two 1:40 pacers; they said they would try to keep an even pace despite the hills. I would therefore fall behind initially but hoped to catch up and overtake them later.

Nutrition? I tend to take a half marathon in my stride as far as possible. Early breakfast. One gel before the start and then nothing, I did not stop at the water stations.
### Race
At 10:15 the race began. I started just behind the 1:40 pacers and as predicted, they disappeared ahead as I laboured up the first hills. The 1:45 pacers passed me as well. Nevertheless I felt pretty good; one redeeming feature of this course is that the starting climb is the worst and there are some nice steady downhills to come. We reached the junction with Kilham Lane on the left and the famous Clarendon Way on the right, the road levels out, and I began to speed up. You need to average 7:38/mile pace for sub-1:40; mile 3 I did in 7:16, mile 4 in 7:00 and mile 5 in 6:39 (yes it is downhill!). 

I thanked the 1:40 pacers as I passed them and they told me that all I needed to do was to stay in front. Well I knew that; but “drained battery” was still to come.

You reach a charming village called Hursley with is the far point of the race. Next comes a relatively gentle climb up a narrow country lane, back to Oliver’s Battery which is on the outskirts of Winchester. Grind up the last major hill, and then the last 4.5 miles are easy. My time on the dreaded segment was 5:22, beating last year’s 5:39, and I was pretty sure then that I would achieve sub-1:40.

The last 4 miles have a few twists. There is an underpass where you actually have to go down steps; I tend to be cautious here for fear of falling over! Then there is a steepish descent, too steep for an ideal pace, followed by a flattish three miles or so to the finish. I tried to keep up the pace, foolishly hoping that I might win my age category. Back into the city centre, under the historic Kingsgate arch, around a few corners, then the sprint to the finish, rudely overtaken in the last stretch by a runner perhaps half my age!
### Post-race
1:37:17 and an improvement of over 3 minutes from last year, but also a bit of an anti-climax. I realised that the not-very-generous race organisers had 10 year age categories so I had no chance of winning (I was 4th out of 24), and also discovered that I had apparently failed to order a t-shirt. 

On the plus side, Starbucks were offering a free coffee to all finishers and I wandered along to collect my tall Americano which turned out to be more tasty than expected, possibly improved by post-race thirst. It was now lunchtime and too late for a second breakfast so I wandered home instead, thanking the excellent marshals en route; a tough day for them since they had been out longer than expected and remained super cheerful and encouraging.

### Training
My [M33] training began somewhat around 13 months ago. I had not run more than maybe 1.5 miles since I graduated college. I decided I needed to get healthy and began running and taking my diet more seriously. I was briefly interrupted due to having my tonsils removed but kept going after. 

My more structured training began 26 weeks before the race. I used Runna as I do well with structured training plans like that. I know it isn’t the best training plan or generator but I really felt myself progressing each week.

Then came the major interruption to training. My wife and I welcomed our twins 6 weeks early and had a 2 week NICU stay. On top of that we faced some major colic and digestive issues once we finally got them home. I was not able to run for almost 10 weeks straight. 

Around 10 weeks before the race I finally got back to being able to run. I restarted my plan and prayed for the best. It was a rough 10 weeks but we made it. All in all, I lost around 45 pounds through training. 65 over all since I started running. 

### Pre-race
Pre-Race was pretty much the same as pre long run. Toast with some peanut butter(I usually have jelly.), a granola bar and some electrolytes. It was a rainy morning but luckily was down to a drizzle by the time I was leaving. 

### Race
The course was a double out and back. That made it a little bit hard to estimate other runners as I wasn’t sure if they were shooting for a 10K or half. I felt decent to start despite getting some lack luster sleep. 

The first time out was pretty good. There were some really slick spots from the rain. Both myself and some other runners almost fell a few times. By the time I was heading back at around 5 miles the humidity was getting to me. I was sweating much harder than normal. 

Between miles 9 and 10 I really hit a wall. I had to stop and walk for a second for the first time. I was starting to get pretty achey and felt like my right leg was cramping. As I got to about 1.5 miles left my right calf was really cramping. Walks became more common. As soon as I realized I wouldn’t hit sub 2 hours I was pretty bummed but I knew I could still hit a PR. 

The twins greeted me at the finish line which really helped!

### Post-race
My legs were toasted. I cramped hard as hell as I waited to grab my medal and see where I placed in my age group. I crushed some chocolate milk they had.

Now I’m gonna crush a pint of Ben and Jerry’s tonight.

1ndmeks,HR training models for couch potato with low RHR,"I'm getting into running and I thought HR training might be a good way to start without overdoing it. There are so many HR equations/models out there that I'm getting a bit overwhelmed and since Google sucks these days, I figure my best bet would be to ask for input here.

The sticking point for me is that my resting heart rate (RHR) is kinda low (\~48-55bpm) despite being a couch potato for years. Cardiologist said its prolly just high vagal tone and nothing to worry about impacting exercise. But since my RHR is so low, I feel like I need to pick an HR calculation that accounts for it because low RHR may violate the assumptions of the more simplistic HR training calculations.

I'd like to ask for some suggestions on how to pick a training strategy from there. I'm the type of person that just needs to pick a prescription/schedule and once it's set, I'll run with it (heh heh). I just want something that isn't wildly off the general range i need to find myself in. Even just linking some resources would be helpful cause again, Google sucks these days. Or telling me that I'm over thinking this and that I should just shoot from the hip and pick one would also be helpful.

Sorry if this is a redundant question. I tried poking around your sub but didn't find anything addressing HR training for someone who is both a couch potato and has low RHR (although I def could have missed something). Any links to previous relevant posts also very much welcome.

Update for anyone bothering to check:

I decided to table HR for now like many here have suggested. Maybe a couple months from now I'll revisit the specific HR recommendations I've seen here. I've been sticking to a 30 min run 3x this week which is 10 min up from the 20 min runs i was doing in prior weeks. They haven't been that bad actually so next week I'll set 3x 40 min runs and then maybe after that I'll do the 2x 30min and 1 x 1hr depending on how i feel. I'm gonna have to plan around activities if they get any longer lol.

Even though i wasn't going to try to run faster, i've been playing around with posture and step length and i found that if i tighten my core and take longer steps, i can go way faster without really expending any more energy (y'all probably already know that). Also, I really like finishing a run at a cruising pace so i've been running incrementally faster each minute to a full sprint in the final 6 min just cause i like the feeling of finishing a run out-of-breath. I feel like that scratches the speed itch I'm still feeling without overdoing it and still making sure i get enough time/distance in.",1757529205.0,11,18,running,fitness
1ndav4l,Are carbon-plated shoes really only effective for faster runners?,"I often see people say that carbon-plated shoes only really help at faster paces, and I’m trying to wrap my head around that.

For example, a runner who’s “fast” at 5:00 min/km (around a 50-min 10K) has a completely different running economy than someone who’s fast at 3:30 min/km (around a 35-min 10K).

From my own training, running at 3:30 min/km feels almost like a sprint — especially during strides — and I feel like I’m putting a lot more force into the ground with each step. Meanwhile, faster runners can cruise at 3:30 min/km with much more efficiency.

That got me thinking:

- If I’m running at 3:30 min/km, am I using the carbon plate more than a faster runner at the same pace?

- Do I get the same level of benefit if I’m working just as hard (relative effort) as a faster runner?

- And finally, would heavier runners see more benefit at slower paces since they’re applying more force with each step?",1757501348.0,227,155,running,fitness

To the more experienced runnitors, if something is a good question or answer, add it to the FAQ.

Post your question -- stupid or otherwise -- here to get an answer -- stupid or otherwise. Anyone can post a question and the community as a whole is invited and encouraged to provide an answer. Many questions get submitted late each week that don't get a lot of action, so if your question didn't get answered, feel free to post it again.

As always, be sure to read the FAQ first. Also, there's a handy-dandy search bar to your right, and if you didn't know, you can also use Google to search runnit by using the limiter ""site:reddit.com r/running"".

Be sure to check back often as questions get posted throughout the day. Sort comments by ""new"" to be sure the newer questions get some love as well.

1nbjz6a,Long runs on hilly terrain as a beginner,"I've been running for 2 months, I ran my last parkrun in 24:45, and I would like to train 2-3 days a week to bring my time down to about 22 min. 

The problem is, I'm now back in my hometown, where it's nearly impossible to find a flat path. After three attempts at running 5k at my race pace, I finally managed to get under 25 min again, but had to walk several times to recover during the run, which didn't happen in my last parkruns. I tried my first 'long' run today, but I really struggled to find a conversational pace when going uphill and had to walk to stop gasping for air. I only did 7k in 46 min, probably less than 6k of actual running, with an elevation gain of 183 m, and I feel more tired than I should after an easy long run. 

There are a lot of threads here about the optimal pace for a long run, which usually recommend going 1-1:30 min/mile slower than racing pace, but I haven't found much advice about hilly terrain, especially for inexperienced runners. So my question is: does a conversational pace even exist when running such steep roads as a beginner/intermediate?

1myutub,What’s the culture on the roads like where you live?,"I do most of my running in 2 places: South Florida and Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The way I’m treated as a runner on the roads in these places is wildly different, and was wondering what it’s like in other areas.

Florida: Even at a crosswalk, cars don’t yield. People with dogs on leashes do not shorten the leash or move so they aren’t taking up the entire sidewalk and I’ve been clotheslined more than once. Dogs off leashes can’t be trusted not to chase you. People walking or standing around chatting, even when they see you coming, do not shift over to let you pass. Cars don’t give you any extra room even if the other lane is empty. Cyclists are hit or miss. Some yield to you, some force you to pull a Homer Simpson in the bushes kind of move to avoid being hit. Other runners wave or nod maybe 1/4 of the time. In short, every person for him or herself. And I hate it.

Massachusetts: Entirely different story. People in cars stop to let me cross even if there isn’t a crosswalk. The cars wait for the other lane to open up so they can give me more room. So much more awareness and consideration to others sharing the road, sidewalk, or trail. Rules generally followed about which side to bike or walk on, and cyclists yield to runners. Eye contact when we pass and some kind of acknowledgement.

I often say we have a culture problem here in Florida, and it transfers into so many aspects of life. It’s very me, not we.

It’s just such a drastic difference. So I’m curious what it’s like in other states and countries.",1756040075.0,559,259,running,fitness

\### Training

I've never been much of a runner. Never really liked any kind of sport. But like a lot of people approaching the wrong side of 40, I needed to lose weight so I started jogging. No plan, no programme, had flunked out of Couch to 5K a few times so I just said I'd run to the next lamp post, the next Pokestop, whatever. Gradually, it became easier to run for a whole song, then a few songs and so on. It got to where I needed to buy proper trainers, proper shorts, something to hold my phone, that kind of thing. Wasn't breaking any land speed records but I was able to do 5-6 km at a time a few times a week. For a few years now, an Autism charity in Ireland has had a 5k run event. It's advertised as accessible and for all ages, abilities and so on but I'd never had any interested in going. This year, as I was starting to get into running, I said I'd sign up. I'm autistic so I figured it would be nice to raise some money for the charity and give something back to my community.



\### Pre-race

My wife was working and I didn't really have any friends who were interested in coming along with me, so off I went on the day on my own. The race was due to start at 12 but the event started at 11, so I said I'd get there for 10:30 to beat traffic and crowds. I figured I could sit in the grass and read my book or just relax and wait for the event to start. The first thing I noticed was how busy it was already. Everyone had my idea, get there early. There was plenty of space but it was already kinda hectic. Next thing was: no bag drop. I had just a change of shirt and some food but there was nowhere to put it, which I thought was a bit of an oversight. I think I was quite unique, almost everyone there had someone with them that was waiting around the finish zone that was holding their stuff. It was definitely more of a family fun day than a race event. Waited around until 11:40 or so and then they kinda called everyone over to do some kind of warm-up and have a little talk about it. They say to not change anything on a race day and I guess that really applies to Marathoners but for 5k, it's probably less important. Still, the race was starting way later than I'm used to (I usually run before work around 7am) and so that was a bit different for ""fuelling"". The other thing was that I never really do a warm up. I stretch my legs a little and walk to my starting point and then run a little slower than my pace until I feel warmed up. This warm up was pretty full on, something that actually tired me out quite a bit ha ha.



\### Race

Eventually, we all got warmed up and lined up and here we go. As the event was accessible, there was plenty of non-runners, walkers, kids on bikes or scooters, people with dogs, everything you could imagine. There was no instructions from the organisers for people to line-up by category or ability or anything (part of the event is the idea of giving everyone the same chance in life, so it all feeds into that). This meant a solid kilometre of having to dodge around people, running on grass and whatever way I could to get around them. Again, as someone who only runs on my own at unsociably early hours, this was a new experience and I didn't care for it. It also meant I went out waaay too fast and had to really reel it back in. I guess some form of adrenaline or excitement kicked in. I eventually found my rhythm, even settling in with some people around the same pace as me (I assumed). One group would walk for half a k or so and then run for half a k. When they walked, they blocked the whole path and I had to run around them to get past. When they ran, they would overtake me comfortably and then spread out in front of me again when they slowed down to walk. That annoyed me a little but at one point I overtook them and they never came past me again, so I guess I won.



Another thing was how hot it was. I know other people run in hot weather but I am not used to it. Usually by the time I finish my run, it's way before the hottest part of the day. It was 22c by the time we got going, unbearably hot for me when I'm not running, never mind when I'm trying to do a 5km. I could really feel myself flagging for the last 2km and they were below my pace. Luckily, my first 3 were fast enough that I was still able to finish under 40 minutes. I don't know if this is normal for an event like this, but the run tracker I use was a little off, not showing 3k until I was about a minute after the marker. On the final stretch, the markers said 500 m to go but my tracker was saying 700 meters. Then, right at the finish line it synched up to 5km and I was so tired I didn't know what had happened (except that I had finished and hit my target). Not sure if that's normal. They also told me the course was flat but my Runkeeper told me I'd had the 3rd most elevation change of any run I'd ever done, so something's not right there ha ha



Something that was a little fun was right at the finish line, two little kids had their hands out to give 5 to the runners but no-one running past was paying them attention (at least from when I spotted them). So as I ran past, I somehow mustered the strength to stoop down and slap their palms and they seemed delighted. I have seen people do this at race events so I was glad I was able to do it, as silly as that sounds.



\### Post-race

Finished the race and got my medal. Felt good. Found a patch of grass and sat down to take a selfie and show off my medal, message my wife and friends and just catch my breath. The post race zone had a water station, so I went over and had some water. Everything else was really busy (coffee place, ice cream van and a sandwich place) and I was pretty exhausted and didn't fancy standing around for much longer, so I headed off. If I was to do this again, I'd make sure I had a few people with me, even if they're not running, because it's more of a family event. I'd also probably get a bit closer to the front for the start to avoid people pushing buggies and with dogs on leads. Speaking of pushing buggies, a guy ran the whole race in front of me pushing his kid in some kind of sports buggy and when I got to the finish line, they were giving the baby a medal. I didn't see if they awarded any dogs a medal. A running club near where my dad lives is doing a 5k for the same charity in November. It's not a family friendly event so I might sign up for that to see what that kind of race is like.



Overall, my first ever running event, I didn't have a bad time but I like running solo for now.

I'm looking to try to bring my time down towards the 20 minute mark over the next few months with a mixture of interval workouts and easy long runs.

I'm doing my easy runs on an 11km route, with the aim of doing 5:30/km pace. I wear a watch to try to maintain that pace, but any time I stop looking at it and try to run for a couple of minutes, I start running 5:00-5:10/km pace and then have to consciously slow myself down again. I barely notice that I'm doing it, it just happens.

I'm finding it frustrating because I'm really not chasing speed or times on these runs. They're purely about getting kilometres into my legs and I do them without the added risk of fatigue, but it's almost as though my body/brain thinks I should be going faster unless I'm spending the entire run staring at my watch.

Does anyone have any methods they use to keep the pace down on easy runs and control their speed? I just want to enjoy them more without having to consciously apply the brakes every couple of minutes.",1755789986.0,381,351,running,fitness

### Background
I [M41] never intended to run a marathon this year. But I had been running consistently since 2023, had two [half marathons](https://np.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1d2i8ub/calgary_half_marathon_a_flawless_training_block_a/) under my belt, and had just wrapped up a [10K training block](https://np.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1l7ztxx/10k_time_trial_chasing_a_stretch_goal/) that ended with a result I was really happy with. So I figured I’d keep the momentum going and aim for something bigger. That ""something"" turned out to be the Edmonton Marathon.

Initially, I set my sights on a sub-4:00 finish, based on my VDOT-predicted time. But I quickly revised that to something more modest: just finishing, ideally around 6:00 min/km. And I was totally fine with revising _that_ upwards if things went south [_Narrator: Oh boy, and did things go south!_]

### Training
For training, I made what I now see as my biggest mistake: I relied on Garmin’s _Daily Suggested Workouts_. The mileage was consistently low; even lower than Hal Higdon's Novice 1 Plan. I was running five days a week, but my weekly totals hovered around 40–45 km. My longest run, in mid-July, topped out at just 17 km (1:48:00).

With just four weeks to go before race day, I realized I had plateaued far short of where I needed to be. At that point, I asked ChatGPT to sketch out a plan for me. It did; and that meant bumping up both weekly mileage and long run distance very quickly. I ran 55 km the first week, with a 25 km long run. The following week, I hit 60 km, including a 28 km long run. On both long runs, I ran the final 5 km at my target pace.

I knew it was risky to ramp both weekly mileage and long run distance so quickly, but I went in prepared to pull the plug if anything felt off. Miraculously, I made it through injury-free, probably thanks to the intensity of my 10K training block and the base building I did before then. 

Still, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. Family and work commitments meant I was up at 4:30 am most mornings to run, before heading straight into a full day. Sleep was poor; often under six hours a night plus a 20-minute afternoon nap.

A month before the race, my wife finally put her foot down and insisted I start going to bed by 10:00 pm. That one change made a huge difference. Within days, recovery improved dramatically. My runs felt fresher, and I had a lot more energy to give.

### Race Day
Edmonton is known for being a fast, flat course. Combined with how my long runs had gone, I felt cautiously optimistic. The weather, though, was a concern: 12°C at the start, climbing to 21°C by late morning.

The race started on the dot at 7:00 am, and the first half went smoothly. I cruised comfortably at 5:50–5:55/km. My heart rate stayed near the lower end of Zone 3.  Fueling was consistent: A gel every 30 minutes, and small sips of water every two km or so. Around 20 km, I felt a tiny twinge in my left hamstring, but a short walk break cleared it up and it never returned.

At the halfway mark, the course loops past the start/finish, and my family was there, cheering me on at the top of their voices. It was the perfect morale boost!

Things started to shift after 25 km, when my pace drifted to 6:20, then 6:30. I wasn’t too worried. My goal pace wasn’t set in stone; I was more focused on finishing well than hitting a number. 

And then, right at 32 km, [the wheels came off](https://imgur.com/11TU34j) -- almost comically in line with what so many other race reports on this sub describe. 

First, I felt a cramp in my right shoulder, followed quickly by one in what I think was the serratus. Like the hamstring earlier, both cleared up quickly and never came back. Finally, my calves started spasming. Not really painful, but on the edge of locking up if I didn’t back off and walk. From then on, I alternated short runs with frequent walk breaks. 

Meanwhile, the sun was out in full force, the temperature had climbed above 20°C, and the course felt endless. Edmonton’s route isn’t exactly scenic: mostly suburban sprawl, no shade, nothing to distract from the grind except for a glimpse of downtown at the start/finish. I was miserable.

I tried to set small targets -- run 1 km, then walk -- but even that became too much. At times, I could barely manage 500 m before the calves forced another break. My pace cratered to around 8:15/km. Strangely, I didn’t feel all that fatigued. Maybe the walk breaks kept my heart rate low, or maybe the calf issues just masked everything else.

Crowd support kept me alive. Every cheer, every clap, helped me shuffle forward. And in the back of my mind, I kept telling myself: ""My wife, my kids, my parents are all there to watch … _no way am I DNF’ing_.""

Eventually, I crossed the finish line, _running_, in 4:39:30. Way off the sub-4 dream, and far from the strong finish I imagined, but it was a finish. My family was there cheering, and that moment made every bit of suffering worth it. And to top it off, I walked away with a massive medal haul: the kids made full use of the activity stations and proudly draped their creations around my neck afterward.

### Assessment
This not the race I dreamed of, but exactly the kind of first-marathon experience I half-expected: plenty of suffering, plenty of lessons. Here are mine:

* A marathon training block is intense. 60 km/week stretches you thin when you’re juggling work and family.

* I can't trust Garmin's DSW for race-specific training anymore. I’ll stick to one of the established plans next time. A longer buildup and more volume are essential to make my legs marathon-ready. Higdon's Novice Plans seem to work well for most people, and they also cut down training days to four a week. 
	
* ChatGPT makes for a passable interim coach, or maybe that's just my survivor's bias talking. 

* Summer marathons are brutal. Running in 20°C+ with no shade is not my idea of fun. I’ll stick to spring/fall races next time.

* Marathon fatigue hits differently. In the final third of a 10K, I’m usually gasping for air, heart redlining, lungs burning. In the marathon, the wasn’t my heart or lungs that failed me, but pure muscular breakdown.
	
Despite the blow-up, I’m glad I did it. I knew a debut could go sideways, and it did -- but I learned a lot. I stayed injury-free, gutted it out instead of stepping off the course when things fell apart, and crossed the finish line.

I get to call myself a ""marathoner"" now. That is good enough. For the time being.

1msru1r,"Zone 2 not intense enough for optimal exercise benefits, new review says","So I think we've all heard the idea that zone 2 (described as an easy intensity where you're able to hold a conversation) is the optimal intensity for most of your runs and the best way to build your aerobic base. Beginners should focus on this zone and they will get faster even by running slow. When you're more intermediate, you can start adding intensity. This was what I always heard when I started running more regularly this year. And I believed it to be true, so most of my runs have been at this zone 2 type intensity.

Well, turns out that this idea is not supported by evidence. A new review of the literature suggests that focusing on zone 2 might not be intense enough to get all the benefits from exercise that you can get from higher intensities.

The review **looked specifically at mitochondrial capacity and fatty acid oxidative (FAO) capacity** and makes the following conclusion:

* ""Evidence from acute studies demonstrates small and inconsistent activation of mitochondrial biogenic signaling following Zone 2 exercise. Further, the majority of the available evidence **argues against the ability of Zone 2 training to increase mitochondrial capacity** \[my emphasis\], a fact that refutes the current popular media narrative that Zone 2 training is optimal for mitochondrial adaptations.""
* ""Zone 2 does appear to improve FAO capacity in untrained populations; however, pooled analyses suggest that **higher exercise intensities may be favorable in untrained and potentially required in trained** \[my emphasis\] individuals.""

What does this mean? My takeaway is this: There is no reason to focus on zone 2. In order to get better at running in the most efficient way, you need to run the largest amount of time in the highest intensity you can without getting injured.

I'm curious to hear your reactions to this paper. Does this change anything in how you approach your training?

They found that the usual acute:chronic ratio (e.g Garmin training load) type thing isn't predictive of injury. The risk was basically flat or even decreased slightly both with increasing training load and increasing weekly distance. Instead they say if you run more than 110% of the distance of the longest run in the past 30 days, injury risk goes up significantly. 

I'm coming back from a long-standing injury so I thought it was pretty interesting. I don't know if I'll disregard weekly mileage or load totally, but this says you should also watch the per run distance and ramp that up slowly.

EDIT: I probably got the definition of acute:chronic ratio ACWR wrong above. It’s not TSS or Garmin training load. It seems to be defined as (running distance in week 4) / (average running distance in weeks 1,2,3) where week 4 would be the current or latest week.",1755206584.0,656,200,running,fitness

1mlseeu,5km training plan for fit(-ish) people who aren’t necessarily runners,"Hello everyone, long time lurker first time poster. This didn't feel like it fit in the training or race report threads as my aim is to share this resource to those in a similar position as I was and endorse this training plan!

Briefly, I do not identify as a runner in particular, but am generally well rounded in fitness training. A few months ago I signed up to a charity race with some colleagues (several of whom very much are runners!) and we made a commitment to all try and set PBs with sub-20 minutes 5km race time, whilst raising money for a good cause.

As someone who would run every now and again as part of a training history that in particular pays more attention to strength and conditioning, I sought out a training plan to focus these efforts for someone who has some base fitness, but isn’t a particularly advanced runner. I came across \[this article\](https://www.mymottiv.com/5k-race/advanced-5k-training-plan) by Amanda Wendorff. I bastardised an intermediary of the 8 and 12 week plans into 10 weeks, then followed the programme damn near to a T. It took my 5km time from an (estimated) 23min down to 19m29s and I would like to share my experience here as an endorsement of this article / the training contained within.

***Background***

Male, mid-30s, 5’10”, military background (so on the fitter side of average but nothing special). Past few years have been strength training focused and not much intensive running since late 20-teens. Before this programme I would do the odd park-run type thing or charity race, the kind of person who would sign up to a 10 miler and without training specifically for it finish in about 80mins. At the start of this training I weighed 91kg. I have no fancy trainers or running gear and used a Garmin Instinct 2 for pacing and HR monitoring throughout training. I took no supplmentation whilst running, although from approx week 5 (as described below) did modify my diet slightly to aid weight loss as we got closer to race day, at which point I was approx 87kg. I do not smoke, I drink sporadically / socially (avg 1.2 units per day across this training period) and generally prioritise rest & sleep sufficiently to recover well.

***The Programme***

Following the above linked article, training weeks were split into 4 sessions. To fit my work schedule, I planned Mondays as the “intense” run (generally high interval and anaerobic training), Wednesdays as the “steady” run (threshold and tempo training), Saturdays as the long run and Sundays as the easy run.

All intense / steady workouts have a planned 10min warm-up (with strides) and 10min cool-downs which are supposed to be HR based – in reality, my warm up was running to my preferred running location, which included a big old hill, at a comfortable slow jog with strides down the far side of the hill. Generally this naturally kept to the HR limitation and my cool-down would involve the reverse of said hill, so no way in hell getting my HR down to the target zone, but albeit an easy(ish) jog of 9-10min/miles was typical. During the 20 training sessions, I completed at least 15 of the planned warm ups / cool downs, but a few were halved in time to fit the training in on certain days when I was forced to run during lunch breaks at work etc..

Paces for easy and long runs were based on Z1 and Z2 heartrates, so realistically for me meant HR<150 bpm being the determining factor for completing these workouts.

Paces for intense and steady workouts were formulated in accordance with the article and therefore based on my \*target\* speed of 6m27s per mile (unapologetically I work in miles, sorry!), using Z3-Z5.

With paces and zones all calculated, I created my training plan using Garmin Connect and at the start of each week deleted the previous intense / steady run plan from my watch and uploaded the 2 new ones. Simple! About an hour’s prep and then minimum fuss to follow for the 10 weeks after – I am not one who enjoys having to think about what I’m doing when running, I like the technology to be counting / timing and pacing for me.

I was very keen to keep strength training concurrently during this programme, lifting 4x / week at a low volume and predominantly upper body... but by about week 4 the cumulative fatigue was simply too much and I could feel both lifts and runs starting to suffer. As a result, I cut resistance training and had 1 full body session (low volume) once a week, usually Thursday as advised by the article but occasionally Friday.

About this time I had noted that my weight had dropped slightly – not unexpected – and around 5 week made a concious effort to allow this to continue. The only modification to my diet was to replace my not inconsiderable work lunch (5x / week) with Huel and otherwise eat as I normally would, including snacking on various fruit across the day. That was sufficient to keep the weight loss at a steady 0.5-0.75kg/week, and although often peckish during the day, not feel like I was depriving myself at any stage or overly hungry.

Otherwise I stuck religiously to the programme. I made all paces programmed with the exception of Intense 2 and Intense 7 – the intervals were too hard and I slipped out of goal paces for multiple intervals in both as the workout progressed. Having pace targets of a range was gratifying in that I could achieve the vast majority of workouts even on low energy days, if I put in a great deal of effort. And on high energy days I would be in the faster range of aim pace. So in both respects, the mental battle / post-workout euphoria was always gratifying! I did not feel myself getting faster or fitter particularly, but in hindsight progress week to week was a steady improvement that is visible over the month-to-month span. The programme ends with an intentional taper as expected before a race.

***Race Day***

For the actual race, our strongest runner (who very much does identify as a runner and as has a sub-17m 5km time!) acted as our pacer and intentionally wanted to “save a little time in the bag in case we needed it” towards the end, so was pacing us to 6m18s miles – something he only told us as we started and too late to discuss! Given the programme does not really simulate a 5k well in the weeks leading up to the race, it was very hard to gauge if I would have the legs and I had to put complete faith in the training plan. And in truth, without the pacer I doubt I would have put in as strong a performance as I did on the day. Either way...

It worked. Finishing the first mile was difficult, but I wasn’t blowing as we hit our first 6m18 aim – the second mile was starting to kick in as a real mental effort to keep going as we approached 13 minutes, but knowing you’re two thirds complete is a huge boon to carrying on… as the finish came into sight with a third of a mile left to go, our pacer silently increased slightly to 6min/miles and I started struggling for breath – around 200y from the finish, I was in full tunnel vision and gasping, fell back from the main group shouting at them to carry on. Hindsight checking my garmin, they must have gone for the sprint finish we’d all joked about as my ‘falling back’ pace to the end was 5m50s/mile and we all smashed our sub-20min target by at least 30 seconds. My HR hit 194 for 30 seconds in that last stretch (it had never exceeded 190 in training), but the 40 training sessions totally approx 35hrs running did the trick and I cannot endorse \[this training article\](https://www.mymottiv.com/5k-race/advanced-5k-training-plan) by Amanda Wendorff strongly enough to anyone of reasonable shape who wants to chip down their 5k time relatively quickly.

1mgqbfp,Race Report: 10K PR After 1.5 Months of Focused Running (7min Drop from Previous Best),"# Race Info

* **Distance:** 10km (solo time trial)
* **Date:** 02.08.2025
* **Finish Time:** 55:00
* **Previous 10K PR (1 month ago):** 1:02:02
* **Pace:** 5:30/km
* **Previous Pace:** 6:12/km
* **Goal:** Sub-57 – ✅

# Background

I’m a 32-year-old male, currently weighing 70kg, down from 75kg when I started training about 1.5 months ago. Until then, I used to run casually — maybe 7km per month, never more than 20km per week.

What changed? I committed to daily running, dialed in recovery and nutrition, and got myself a proper GPS watch to track VO2 Max and effort more accurately. **I’ve gone from a VO2 Max of 43.5 (lab) to 53 (watch)**, and built up to 85km per week of running.

So far, **I’ve logged 330km in total during** this new chapter.

My Zone 3 pace is 5:30/km at 153 bpm, and I ran both my recent 10k and the previous one at that exact HR — so the pace improvement has come from efficiency gains and consistent training.

# Plan

I’m currently following a Garmin Coach plan with a goal to run a 10k at 4:40/km pace by October 1st. So far, the focus has been on consistency, aerobic base, and staying injury-free.

# Training Choices

* Running almost every day (mostly Zone 2, +1-hour runs)
* VO2 max and sprint intervals a couple times a week
* Cross-training with bouldering and calisthenics
* Core strength training
* Volume at \~85km per week with minimal burnout

# Pre-Race

* Ate a banana \~30 minutes before starting
* Wore my Asics Novablast 5 (first race in them)
* Carried a trail vest with electrolyte drink (sipped every 15 mins)
* Took carb gummies every 15 mins — trying out fueling strategy for longer efforts

# Race Breakdown

* KM 1: 4:20 – went out too hot
* KM 2: 5:13 – reeled it back
* KM 3: 5:20 – started locking into rhythm
* KM 4–10: steady between 5:35–5:45/km, doing loops around a 1km park– relaxed form, focused breathing, consistent cadence

# Mindset

I feel like I'm entering a completely new zone. Running gives me this insane feeling of peace — like I’m in a Zen temple retreat, totally in the moment. No distractions, just me and the movement. That feeling has become just as important as the metrics.

# What’s Next

* Keep building toward my 4:40/km 10K in October
* Incorporate more strides, hill sprints, and strength work
* Stick to the joy: running + bouldering + calisthenics
* Run my first ultramarathon before the end of the year

Also worth noting: **My race prediction from the watch has gone from 4:08:46 to 3:31:28 for the marathon.** I haven’t actually run a full yet, so I take it with a grain of salt — but it keeps me motivated and dreaming big.

# Would love to hear from you

* Is this progress promising for someone aiming to move into ultras, and in general, a beginner?
* Have you made the jump from max running half-marathons into ultras? If so, how has this journey been like?
* How much trust do you place in Garmin’s race predictions? 

Thanks for reading — I’m just getting started and really open to sharing progress stories. Let’s gooo !!!",1754245035.0,66,21,running,fitness

1mfa4ab,"How did/do you combat days you felt/feel heavy, mentally done mid-run or cant be asked to go on a run? Especially when you just started out!","Hi! So kinda long:

I began running last year using couch to 5k and got to running 30 mins consecutive (I was a whole 10kg heavier when I started). Took a 7 month break from November for health reasons and returned and trained up again around June. Got to running 30 mins by the 5th week, skipping bits of couch to 5k and l've been doing that three times a week for two weeks now (6 weeks now into this).

Only problem; these last three runs have been crazy difficult - mentally and also my legs feel heavy? Like I know I can run 30 mins but I keep telling myself I'll stop in 5 mins to get through it, and my legs are like dead weights. My speed's dropped a bit and my heart rate readings seem like they've gone up a bit (I segment every 5 mins on the workout Apple Watch so I can look back on it). I'm kind of confused because before 15 minutes would pass by quickly and I could keep a faster pace throughout with a sprinter finish.

Today's Friday so l've done my third run of the week, I have two days before my next run, my week usually looks like this: 
run + strength, 
Pilates, 
run, 
strength, 
run, 
Steps and some light core 
rest

and outside of running I get 10k steps in every day even on my rest days. I don't do heavy lifting just body weight and a little extra.

I do my workouts at home and it's nothing crazy - usually push ups, weighted table rows, wall sits, leg raises and glute bridges, dead bugs, Russian twists etc. Depending on the day.

I'm a bit perplexed. Not sure if it's just me still adjusting to 30 min intervals considering so far it's been progressive overloads? I wanted to increase the run length to get to the stage where I can run marathons but I don't know if now's the time for that when I'm ready to just stop after 15-20 minutes.

Before this happened, I was genuinely enjoying running, l'd be smiling through it (until the last stretch where l'm tired but still able to get a sprint finish in and go really fast - for me) and it felt freeing. I did think it was maybe down to my cycle, but then it also doesn't make sense because when I was meant to feel lighter I felt dead.",1754086993.0,53,63,running,fitness
1mf7g5h,Learn from my injury recovery mistakes!,"Skip to the end for TL; DR.

Back in December, while training for my first half marathon, I twisted my ankle in a deep hole in the sidewalk. I went down hard and ended up a little bloody. I could not bear any weight on my ankle and had to sit on the sidewalk for several minutes before hobbling home. Once home, I RICEd it and went on to work. I knew it was sprained; it was obvious by the swelling and pain, but I figured it would go away on its own. I am one of those stubborn men that doesn't like going to the doctor for these sorts of things because they will ""get better on their own."" After about a week, I tried to run on it again, even though it still hurt and was clearly swollen. This made the pain and swelling worse. Fast forward three weeks, and several more unsuccessful attempts to run on it, and my wife finally convinced me to go to the doctor.

At first, they thought it might be fractured, which would have sucked, but I told myself I could deal with the downtime. Then we did an MRI just to make sure it wasn't something more serious. Spoiler alert, it was! Turns out I had a grade three ATFL sprain. Yikes! Treatment? One full month non-weight bearing, followed by another month of light weight bearing (in boot), and then PT for a minimum of 6 weeks. Double yikes! Thank the Lord they didn't want to do surgery, but this recovery timeline still sucked. The ortho and my GP made it pretty clear that had I gone in sooner, there may have been a chance my recovery would have been shorter, and there's a good chance it wasn't that bad until I tried to run on it repeatedly.

Honestly, the physical part of the recovery wasn't so bad. I think that is because I followed my PT's advice very carefully when it came to my rehab exercises. However, I struggled mentally. Pretty hard. You see, before I started running and eating a clean diet, I was borderline obese. I started running as a means to lose weight, which I did successfully (down 60+ pounds), but it went from a chore to a hobby very quickly. I ran for the fun of it, not out of necessity. It became a very important outlet for me, like my own therapy in a way. A time for me to unplug, get outside, and just connect with myself. Not to mention how great it felt whenever I achieved a running-related goal that I once thought was impossible. Now, in my mind, a very important part of my routine, and honestly my life, had been forcefully taken away, and I could do nothing but wait until I was recovered.

I started to over-restrict my calories. Started overdoing it in the gym in other ways. Started to eat more ultra-processed foods that I had previously given up. I tried to live a more ""gym-bro"" centered life. I was terrified that if I didn't do SOMETHING, then I would lose all my progress. What I didn't realize was that I was likely making things worse by doing this. The wake-up call again came from my wife, who saw my gloomy mood, saw that I was reverting back to bad habits, and realized that this whole thing was taking its toll on me. One day, she finally said something to me, and it woke me up. I realized how terrible I felt every day, physically and mentally, and thought back to how I felt before when I was less restrictive and just focused on eating for health vs trying desperately not to gain weight that took me more than a decade to gain in the first place. I was overtraining any way I could without injuring my ankle more in an attempt to keep myself busy and find an outlet, even though I likely should have been resting more and allowing my body to heal.

So, I started to focus more on wellness again, treated my body with grace, and now seven months after my injury, I feel better than ever and I am running again! Everyone focuses on the physical part of recovery, but man does the mental stuff take its toll. I definitely learned a lot through this experience.

TL; DR - learn from my mistakes. If you are injured or think you may be, don't ""wait it out."" Get it checked, and for the love of all that is holy, follow the physio/PT's guidance and timeline. While recovering, don't be afraid to talk to someone about your mental health if you are struggling.",1754080369.0,178,25,running,fitness

There's the store owner of your favourite running shop who's also been a runner and trainer. There's ""Born to run"". There's the community. There are doctors. Every group seems to recommend the one best shoe type to use in the long term for mid to long runs.

Is there some up-to-date science that would either recommend something like ""minimal shoes will prevent most injuries in the long term"" or ""cushioned shoes will do that best""?

Or is it - like so often - rather a ""it depends""?

Which type of shoes (or none at all) will support ones feet in the terms of least injuries if one takes the time and training required to prepare the feet and legs properly to get used to them?

Is there an answer?

**Edit: TL;DR: of the answers so far:**

*No, there is no clear evidence of any specific shoe type reducing injuries if compared to other shoe types.*

The types of injuries one gets are specific to every person and a special shoe type might reduce injuries for one person, but not for another, let alone in general.

The best advice is to have different types of running shoes and rotating them between the runs, as they pose different forces to one's feet and legs, so different muscles will be trained by that rotation.

In the broader view, muscle training is a key ingredient to reducing injuries, not shoes. To that respect, barefoot and minimal shoes can help, but there is no advice for (or maybe rather even advice against) using barefoot/minimal shoes without long and good training and without rotation with other types of shoes (unless you grew up without wearing any shoes, then pure barefoot running might be the best choice).",1753729669.0,65,53,running,fitness

# Training

Followed Runna's 10k plan, 3x runs / week for 8 weeks and found it very encouraging and achievable.  Mostly long runs, easy runs with at least one interval or strides run per week.  For my next race I plan to increase to 4x / week.

# Pre-race

This is the first race I've signed up for in a long time and I wasn't really a runner before so it never occurred to me that there could be ""scam"" races out there. The ""we'll send out the course map a few days before the race"" description should have been a tell-tale sign and sure enough, a week before the race we get the ""course"" map: A stretch of running path that is approximately 0.7 miles long.

It wasn't until the night before the race that I realized the ""course"" was 0.7 miles, I mistakenly thought it was 1.5 so I'd only need to do two out-and-backs.  But I used a footpath app to see it would in fact be...four-ish out-and-backs.

What's worse? There's an intersection right in the middle of this 0.7 mile stretch :facepalm: that I had to cross 8 times.

Anyway, the organization consisted of: two very nice and helpful coordinators who gave out bibs, a snack station near their sign-in area, a couple traffic cones by the ""starting line"", and instructions that ""you can start whenever you like.""  The organizing body is called ""The Best Races"" and I get the impression all of their events are like this.

There was a pretty decent turnout.  But about half of the people who showed up were wearing shirts for some charity run to fight breast cancer.  Turns out ""The Best Races"" was hosting the same run with two brands - the one I signed up for and [Run Together Against Breast Cancer](https://findarace.com/us/events/run-together-against-breast-cancer-5k-10k-13-1-los-angeles).  I would seriously question the legitimacy of the charity run.

For some reason, a week or two before the race, the organizers encouraged registrants to select a starting time but this turned out to be pointless as no one was organizing heats of runners on the day-of.

# Race

Whatever, I trained to crush a 10k and that's what I set out to do.  Like every rookie runner, I started too fast, even though everyone says not to start too fast, and regretted that around mile 3.

Occasionally I had to sprint to make it across the intersection before the light changed (or sometimes right after) and that messed up the consistency of my pace almost every time.  Once or twice I had to stop and wait for the walk sign.

Around miles 4 and 5 I saw my pace slipping but didn't feel like I had the energy to bring it back up.  But I remembered a ""secret weapon"" I discovered during training which was faster cadence - by increasing my cadence and maintaining a good posture I would run faster without feeling like I was exerting more effort.  Worked every time!  Runna didn't prepare me for this, a random coworker mentioned it, so thanks for that, Bailey.  This kept me within my goal pace the rest of the way.

# Post-race

Got a banana at the check in station, walked around Santa Monica's running path / pier a bit.  Street parking was free until 9am.

So I wouldn't say this race was a scam, exactly, it just had many scam-like qualities.  But they did mail me a race shirt, hand out bibs and snacks, and gave out stickers.  And parking was super easy and free.  I guess I don't mind too much that I did this instead of a legitimate race because I'm just getting started, but guaranteed I will not be doing a ""The Best Races"" run again.  Especially when the strand beach path that goes miles and miles along the beach was right that and would have been a much nicer alternative.

1m9xg5q,Lace pain from locking heel,"I was recently told by my podiatrist that I need to wear a larger size shoe (in general, not just running). Basically, I was using a tight heel and toes to keep my foot from sliding in the shoe, which was bad for my nail matrices. After reading a bit, it sounded like many people like a thumb width between their toes and the end of their running shoes, so I also bought bigger running shoes (up 1 1/2 sizes, which tells you how cramped they were).

Edit: to clarify, I was wearing 1 - 1 1/2 sizes below what I measured, so he was not suggesting wearing some that was 1 -1 1/2 sizes too big, just bigger.

My problem is that now, in order to keep my foot from sliding forward, I have to use the laces to lock the foot back. I've tried several ways to tie my shoes, including the traditional method, the runner's lock (creating loops in the last two eyelets that the laces then pass through), and several modified versions of the lock. Regardless of what I do, to keep my heel back, it feels painfully tight on the tendons right at the bend (under where the laces usually cross last). Even avoiding having the laces cross directly over that spot by going from the upper eyelets directly to lower ones, only helped slightly.

I can run with it that way, but it is not at all comfortable, leaving that spot tender afterwords. I've experienced this in both Hoka Clifton 8's and Saucony TR17's.

Am I missing something? Any suggestions? Padding?

1m9gqvc,What are running groups like in your area?,"I spent the past 13 years in NYC, running almost as long, and started attending running clubs maybe four years ago. Running groups are plenty in NYC and tend to be informally organized and smaller (<30 people). Even the most well-known clubs aren't that big. Most groups host runs at least a few times a week and do something after (e.g., a cafe). With the small size, it's super easy to get to know regulars and make friends.

Cue my surprise coming out to LA and being told by locals that running is big here. For such a big area, LA really doesn't have many run clubs, and they're all HUGE.  The Venice Run Club apparently gets hundreds of people per run?!  The only run club that size in NYC is Midnight Runners, which I didn't like attending because it's too large and too anonymous.  Run clubs are super polished and manicured, too, with slick websites, branded merchandise, etc.

I'm surprised because LA is huge geographically and there are so many places to run, and commuting sucks--you'd think there would be smaller micro groups, but there aren't (or at least, I have not found them).

That makes me wonder about running club culture elsewhere. What is it like where you live? Is LA the norm? Is NYC? Somewhere in between?

I’m athletic and love sports but man I hate running. So like any sane person I signed up for the Chicago marathon and got it. I’ve been training for a while now since I can’t run a mile without walking. I’ve gotten my mileage up to ten miles so far and am on track with a marathon plan. It’s just I’m super slow (13 min miles since I’m walking parts) and I feel like everything’s going wrong. Turns out I have mild compartment syndrome in my calf and my doctor wants an mri for my other knee since he thinks there could be complications there too. I just feel so injury prone but I’m doing everything right (PT, stretching, doctor). I want to do this. I want to run the marathon and I think I can I’m just scared. What if I do it and don’t finish? I know it happens to people and that’s their story but I would be embarrassed and sad and just I’m scared. Thanks for reading my rant and I guess I want to see if anyone else was scared before their first marathon and how do you get over it/what was making you scared or not scared

Positive vibes only please

Edit: addressing some comments - I do have the okay from PT and doctor to run it. I’m not worried about what my final time would be, I just want to be able to cross that finish line!",1753358941.0,107,101,running,fitness

1lzipim,New study shows accumulated distance (10% rule) less important than single run impact,"I just heard an interview with the people behind this study, the Garmin Runsafe study (link below), and they say that we should worry much more about the impact of the single run than the accumulated runs over time (the 10 percent rule etc) when it comes to injury.

""The study suggests that overuse injuries don’t develop over time, as previously believed, explains Rasmus Østergaard Nielsen, associate professor and senior researcher at the Department of Public Health at Aarhus University and one of the researchers behind the study.

“Our research shows that overuse injuries occur much more frequently during a single training session when the runner runs too far compared to what they are used to,” he says.

So even though some running programs suggest increasing your distance by 10 or 20 percent on your next run, according to the new study, that's far too much, says Rasmus Østergaard Nielsen.

“If we want to stay somewhat safe when increasing our distance, a five percent progression is more sensible. If you're used to running five kilometers, that means you can add just 250 meters on your next run,” he says.

This means that if, for example, you want to train to run 10 kilometers, you’ll need to set aside a longer period than some running programs recommend.

Additionally, there are many other factors that can influence your risk of injury. According to Rasmus Østergaard Nielsen, the study’s findings likely apply to other changes in your running routine as well.

“That could be running much faster than you’re used to, running in a new pair of shoes where the load is different, or suddenly running a lot on sand when you're used to running on asphalt.”

There has previously, including in the research community, been a narrative that overuse injuries develop gradually over time, but that cannot be documented, according to Rasmus Østergaard Nielsen.

“We’ve been pulling our hair out for 20 years trying to figure out why we weren’t finding anything. We looked into the individual training sessions, and that’s why we believe our research project has such great potential—it changes the narrative of how injuries occur.”

“We should view injuries more as something that happens during a single training session, rather than something that develops gradually over time.”

The study is the largest study of running injuries ever conducted and is based on data from more than 5,200 participants.


My thought is that some of the metrics in our running watches needs to be looked at.

1lzigd1,Have We Been Tricked by Running Shoe Companies? Do Super Cushioned Shoes Actually Reduce Injuries?,"I’ve been thinking about all the hype around running shoes over the past 10years. Super cushioned soles, maximalist shoes, “super shoes” with carbon plate. It’s like every brand promises we’ll run faster and stay injury-free if we just buy the latest pair.

But has any of this actually reduced injury rates? From what I’ve read, the answer seems… not really. I’m in my forties and returning to running having been out of the game for 8 years and it is so strange going to the specialist stores, the sole thickness is off the charts and the staff are describing the benefits in almost exact opposite terms to the early 2000s. My preference has always been to have a good feel for the ground, not in a barefoot running way but in a what I would class as normal sole kind of way but options like that seem long gone. So, what do you all think, have we been duped or are maximalist shoes truly better? Lightweight as a goal always made more sense to me than bulky and squidgy.",1752487438.0,261,318,running,fitness

1lzau4x,Running shorts for thick thighed women,"Exactly as the title states. I have a bubble butt - thick thigh combo, and every time I try something other than a biker short or a short with a very long inseam, it fails me. It’s a little harder because my waist is slimmer than my lower body, so it either fits one or the other. I often see women running with the cute V-cut shorts that are a little flowy I am wondering if I’m missing out! I’m kind of sick of the daily runner biker short only look, they’re definitely functional and they prevent chafing (until they’re worn through) but maybe I haven’t found what will be my new bff for the cute but functional chafe game! I do have bodyglide and I lay it on thick but sometimes it just doesnt cut it and the shorts I do have ride up (which is rather unflattering and uncomfortable digging the fabric out every 2 minutes). Maybe I’m looking for something that doesn’t exist. Maybe you wonderful people will lead me to the promised land product. I figured if anyone would know, it’s yall! Bonus points for high waist, maybe with a drawstring to actually fit the waist, and pockets. Thank you in advance!! 

P.S. if there’s any general tips on sizing/fabric/ styles please share! Would love to know what has worked for you in the past💖",1752460030.0,56,72,running,fitness

I came 37th in my category (age 20-24 F), average pace 4:37, with a time of 1:37:37!

### Training
I'm pretty new to running, so it was a hell of a learning journey for me. I still have a workout preset saved on my watch called 'Tempo 1' consisting of x5 1 km (I thought anything over 800m was too long to count as an interval). I was anxious about never having done any serious training or anything close to a half-mara distance before, so I trained for about 20 weeks all up (albeit starting at a pretty low intensity/mileage of 20-30 km per week for the first half of training).

Goals-wise, I had initially just set out to finish somewhere within 1:46-1:55 when I signed up for the race in January, but as with training going well I decided to push harder for sub 1:45. After a particularly good track session about 8 weeks out, I was feeling competitive and cranked it to 1:40, although I didn't actually think I could do it once the cockiness wore off a few days later. But I decided to stick to it anyway because 'aim for the moon and you'll land among the stars'.

Over time, I developed a 4-run weekly split which normally looked like the following:

Tuesday: 7-10k either tempo or easy

Thursday: a track session - either I'd do a progression run (if I'd done an easy run on Tuesday) or intervals (8x400, 4x100, or 6x1k) with a long warm up/cool down. This would usually total 10-13k in distance.

Saturday: fast parkrun, followed by another easy 5k

Sunday: long run of 10-16k typically, with the longest being 18.5k

I peaked at 51 km 5 weeks prior to the race, but kept running 45+ km for another 2 weeks before tapering.

My final run before the taper was a particularly fast 12k progression run one Saturday after a Friday night out, which resulted in me straining my left achilles (which still hasn't gone away completely). I felt the niggle as I was walking home, not thinking much of it - I actually thought it was a surface wound and I'd just nicked the skin from walking too far in heels the night before.

Went out again for my usual Tuesday and Thursday runs (both short and easy, about 5k at 5:30/km pace for my taper) and it wasn't going away. I was scared out of my wits since I'd heard for years that there was no running injury more vindictive than an achilles. But I could still walk, it wasn't hurting enough to stop me from running completely, and I had faith.

I began fanatically researching, icing, and eccentric heel-dropping with only one week to go. Bought KT tape, kept stretching and resting, only ran easy, about 16 kms in the final week before the race on Sunday. I'd developed a habit of going to parkrun every week, so I went as usual for my shakeout to help settle my nerves. It felt good, the air was nice, the achilles felt ok, and I was feeling at least sort of confident for the race again.

### Pre-race
I got out of bed at about 3:30 am after a night of tossing and turning. The night had been a cycle of reading race reports on this sub and then drifting off phone in hand, only to start awake after 20 mins, convinced that I was already late. But race day adrenaline REALLY is something else. My heart was pounding through to my skull already, and I was ready to jump 6 feet into the air at the slightest sound outside on the street, even despite getting barely any rest.

I made and ate my breakfast of oatmeal and frozen raspberries with peanut butter and honey. Drank my coffee, which did what I needed it to do after some squats and lunges. Full makeup and braided my hair - got to be prepared in case those race photos were going to be my last.

My parents took me (dad drove and mum came with me to the start line), about a 30 min drive. The whole way there I sat in the back like a little kid, rocking back and forth in my seat, shaking quietly and questioning why I thought this was a good idea.

Got there at about 6 am for a 6:40 start in the B wave. I (very stupidly) thought that 30 mins before the race start would be enough for a bathroom trip since the toilets were close by - it definitely wasn't and I could see the lines bending around the portables. Seeking alternative solutions, I set off circling the area for bushes to pretty much no avail - there was a bit of shrubbery in a patch of mud but I didn't want to ruin my white shoes and risk slipping in the mud with my shorts around my ankles.

Decided to just hold it - I wasn't busting desparately anyway, and it might've just been me starting to overthink every small twinge in my state of pre-race panic. Taped up my ankle, tied my ribbons into my hair, chugged the rest of my Gatorade (yes despite my bladder concerns minutes earlier), and made my way into the corral.

### Race
Typical rookie move of starting out FAST. My goal pace was 4:46/km (or a few seconds under) to finish in 1:40, and setting off I felt pretty steadied and was shuffling along with the crowd at what I thought was a fairly conservative speed. Glanced down at my watch about 1 km in and I'd gone through it in 4:36.

I was surprised and I also wasn't given the adrenaline wave I'd barely been bridling, but I was anxious that only 5% into the race I might already be heading towards a crash and burn. But it was race day and I couldn't have stomached holding back and leaving anything on the table - what if I could push through? I decided I'd hold steady for the time being and just dial back if I started feeling it too early.

The first 10k felt amazing, the course was scenic, and there was a beautiful sunrise coming up as we ran by the water (a very nice change from the neverending laps around the same two concrete circuits and red 400m that made up most of my training). It wasn't overly busy just yet and I could see quite far ahead, which made it easy to run the tangents and I was cruising through the almost totally flat paths thus far. I went through the 10k mark at 46:12. Started thinking, maybe I really can do this.

Stopped (well, still half-running because I was terrified of slowing down) at the aid station 12k in. My steps threw half of my cup of water in my face, so I probably gulped a quarter of it and wore the rest. I was still feeling all right, not fully suffering yet, but my heart rate was rising from the steady low 150s to the high 150s and entering the 160s. By this point, I was halfway and starting to think about the end - the first half was good primarily because I didn't let myself acknowledge the distance left (I don't think I could've held pace if I'd told myself at 4k that I'd have to do this for another 17). 9 km left was at least in the single digits, a lot less threatening. But my legs were starting to ache, blisters were coming in, and I had now reached the roll of the first hill.

The strait of 12k to 16k, it was like all the runners were surfing a massive 4 km long wave. The uphills were difficult in either length or incline, but not both, and there was still plenty of relief in the downhill we were rewarded with for every climb. I think I made a lot of my race in the first 10k and also in this section, as I kept a pretty straight path and used gravity to fly down the hills (slow cadence, long strides, low arms) while I slowed to save energy on the ascents. Actually, this was pretty much the theme of the rest of the race as the hills got steeper, which you can see from my splits in the last half. Funnily enough, I finished with 4 back-to-back 23-minute 5ks - exactly 4:37/km pace in each segment. It evened out I guess!

The push through 17, 18, 19k, fighting demons. That one climb at 17k was UNRELENTING (Anderson St Hill - straight from hell). You could feel the evil force of gravity trying to drag us all backwards and tumble us on heavy legs that didn't have much left to resist with. In my photos you can see me leaning forwards almost clawing my way up, I felt like somehow I could pull myself upwards by the arms to the crest.

What got me through this was my mum finding me just at the relief of that ascent as I passed the 18k mark. Once I saw her, I yelled, waved, I felt a sudden rush and picked up the pace, and went for the full send. 3 km left, it was go time - I was gritting my teeth and ramping up for the last push to empty the tank.

As I hit 20k, I looked at my watch again and it said 1:32:something. That left me with over 7 minutes to run the last 1.1 km, which I knew I could do even on my worst days. I wish I hadn't looked, because I was in pain by this point and I might've been able to push harder if I hadn't had that confidence that I would reach my goal. But I crossed the finish smiling wide and happy that I'd made it. (Before doubling over in direct line of finishing photography.)

### Post-race
My mum was there to catch me at the finish line and she told me my result - she held my phone during the race and the preliminary result had already come through. Almost 3 whole minutes ahead of my target!!! Now I'm not usually the most physically expressive person ever, but there I was jumping for joy, whooping, arms in the air, feeling like I'd just conquered the world.

We walked back towards Flinders after, coffee and cake at Brunetti, the best cheesecake I've ever tasted. Grill'd for lunch too, I was almost expecting not to have much of an appetite but I ate like no tomorrow. We talked about the race, went through all the photos, laughing at the race shots (glad I lived to tell the tale because those photos could CERTAINLY not be my last). I'm so beyond grateful to my mum and I could never had made it without knowing she was cheering me the whole way.

After getting home: ate, bath, bed, movie, 8 hr sleep. EXCRUCIATING DOMS.
I'm walking, but it will be more of a hobble for probably at least the next couple days.",1752457937.0,61,20,running,fitness

### Training

This was my first time joining an organized race; Training plan was self designed at 3 runs a week, increasing by not more than 10% weekly mileage with a back off every 4th week. One run would be some kind of speed work, one long run, and one easy run.

I had 6 months to build up, but did pick up a hip injury halfway thru which took me out for 3 weeks. In the following 3 months, training wasn't ideal either as I was plagued with peronneal tendonitis on both feet and had to reduce my mileage (any tips for prehab?)

My peak volume was 31km at 3 weeks out, with a long run of 17km. Was supposed to do a 18km the following week but feet were hurting so I cut it to a 15km.

Did NO long runs in the final 2.5 weeks, which I thought was a death sentence to any respectable timing. To make things worse, my right peronneals were flaring up real bad in the final week so I did not run at all in the 8 days leading up to race day. 

### Pre-race
The day before race day, my peronneals hurt so much (every step was sore) I was super bummed and mentally prepared to just walk/run the course. Being my first running event ever, I just tried to tell myself to enjoy the experience. I tempered my expectations from a sub 2:20 to a 'dont DNF'

Race morning, I had a can of Milo and some Julies peanut butter biscuits. Race fuel was 1 SIS gel, 1 GU Cola gel, 1 PURE gel, 1 GU choc (I felt GU gives me the most 'boost' but eating too many GU gels makes my tummy upset, so I tried to mix it up. SIS and PURE go down more easily for me)

I also taped up my right foot based on some random Google link to help my peronneals; midfoot hurt a bit still so I also wrapped 2 lines across my midfoot. Shockingly, this helped immensely and I didn't feel discomfort in my right foot all race!

Weather was 10 deg C which is a very cold run for me, coming from a country with lowest temps at 24 deg C (SG). Donned a secondhand sweater waiting for the start, which I shed before the gun. Race attire was an UA tee, arm sleeves, shorts over running long tights, and gloves.

Was also supposed to start in Wave D (>2:06)), but we (me and my friend) got tired of walking down the long line and just slipped in with the Wave C runners (1:56-2:06) and decided to pace ourselves.

### Race
0-10km:

We didn't agree on a pace, but I knew she wanted to finish under 2:10 if possible. I initially wanted to go more conservatively because of my injuries but I decided to follow her as long as I could, as it felt nicer to run with someone.

She set off pretty quick - my target race pace was 6:30/km (easy run pace during training was 6:50-7) - we were going at 5:15-6:00 in the first few km with some downslopes but settled at around 5:45-6 in the mostly flat first half.

The first 10km felt pretty chill physically. My feet weren't hurting and 6:00/km was theoretically a fast pace for me, but somehow in the cold weather it felt perfectly manageable and very comfortable. I shed my gloves after about 5km, though with the random gusts of cold wind, it was still an overall very cold race for me even after my body warmed up a bit.

The route brought us back into the CBD, away from the event village, which meant virtually no supporters. The segment ended off running alongside the river with a nice view of the yachts and city skyline, and we crossed back towards the Royal Botanic Gardens.

10-15km:

My wife was waiting at the Gardens so I was looking forward to this segment and got a hi-five boost at about 11km. This was also where more and more spectators lined the course and made for a more motivating environment. The course was mostly flat still; my ankles and feet started to get more fatigued from this point, but I was surprised I could still hold my pace and keep a steady rhythm.

15-18km:

The start of a series of climbs. You can actually anticipate it due to the route looping to a turnaround at 15km so you pass everyone coming back on the gentle climb from 15-17km.

I lost my running buddy as she held a strong effort and I just tried to keep a steady rhythm to not blow up as I passed some walkers. The climb got a little steeper 17-18km before levelling out. My left foot had began to hurt but nothing that went beyond 2/5 so thankful for that. 

18-20.7km:

I had taken a gel at 5km, 9.5km, 14km. I had planned for one more at 18.5km but my stomach was feeling slightly weird so I skipped the gel but took a full cup of electrolyte drink at the aid station instead.

This segment was as good as a victory lap. Mentally I knew I was not going to stop even if things started to hurt so I pushed and maintained my rhythm.

There were many more spectators and you can feel the vibe shift as you get nearer to the end. Every runner was pushing harder which made me push harder too (tho not really reflected in my splits)

There were still some steep but short climbs near the end that threatened to cramp me up but turned out ok. 

Was such a rush running through the finish line with my arms raised as I acknowledged my imaginary fans... And was so pleasantly surprised to smash my goals despite the injury woes leading up to the race.

(The course length turned out about 300m short, but even if I added that I think it's a comfortable sub 2:10!)

### Post-race
We walked around the event village to snap photos, grab some small freebies - some choc protein milk, some candy, and nothing much. Is it normal for events not to give a finishers tee/ singlet? Was expecting one and bummed to only have a medal.

Quite an interesting first-time experience running a race effort for '21km', though it was only made possible with the cold weather (my usual training weather is 28-33 deg C). 

Had a cheeseburger for lunch but my body was having the shits for most of the day (from gels? From the hard effort?) so couldn't really stomach much food. 

What's next? Probably do a block of strength training for injury prevention before going into another HM training block to see if I can replicate this timing in hot and humid Singapore. Then maybe, just maybe, a full in 2026?

For now, everything is sore, but my heart is full.

I’m wondering if there was some new research or maybe an influencer that caused this type of training to boom.

Most of my training comes from the book Faster Road Racing where a zone 2 run would be a recovery run. The book makes it seem like it’s just a way to gain extra mileage in between hard workouts so I can’t understand why it would be popular for runners who aren’t doing structured workouts to begin with.",1752250845.0,347,302,running,fitness

1lwqced,Looking for advice on how to safely run on uneven terrain and hilly routes,"Hi everyone,
I’m 35, male, 171 cm tall and currently weigh 87 kg. I started running this year to improve my cardiovascular health and maintain a healthy weight (my family has some issues at this point 😅), so staying fit is a long-term goal for me.

I’ve got a sedentary job and lots of stress, so running became my go-to way to reset both physically and mentally.
Now I’m running about three times a week, carefully alternating techniques. I’ve read different articles on running form, and I try to keep my bounce low to reduce impact and avoid harsh landings. I also always do warm-up stretches before running and cooldown stretches after.

My diet is about 1500 kcal per day with balanced meals (veggies, meat, fish, etc).
After a while, I really fell in love with running. I’m not chasing pace, just trying to develop solid technique. My goal now is to recover from a minor knee issue and be ready to run a 10K during the Warsaw Marathon events this autumn, and maybe a half marathon next year.

The issue I’m facing is terrain. My city is hilly, and parks have very uneven paths. Many of the paths are slightly dome-shaped across their width and keep reversing, putting alternating stress on each leg. But running on sports fields became boring almost instantly.
Despite running carefully in road shoes (Skechers Go Run Max Road 6), the inconsistent surface caused a problem.

I’ve read through many posts here, but it seems I still haven’t found quite what I’m looking for. And I’d really love to hear from others who have dealt with constantly changing terrain.
How did you manage to avoid injuries when running on uneven surfaces? What helped in practice?

I’m really motivated to keep going, just want to do it safely and sustainably.

UPD: last time I got my knee injured, so I would also be really glad to hear your advices at this point.",1752186765.0,11,40,running,fitness

###**Using r/running**



The mods do their best to actively moderate this community. When posting, we expect users to make an effort to familiarize themselves with our rules and practices before submitting posts or comments. We suggest taking note of **Rule 2** *and* **Rule 7**, *since these are the most commonly broken which will result in a thread being removed.*

The mod team has tried to lay out the rules with some expected guidelines of what is or is not allowed, but there is always some gray area and posts are up to interpretation by the mod team.  We do our best to be consistent, but that isn’t always the case with multiple mods or even the same mod between similar posts.  The mod team wants to make /r/running a resource for new and experienced runners and to build a community between all types of runners.

Regardless of that fact, Moderators have the final say.  We are open to hearing differing opinions, but the mod team will make the final decision.  Visitors and posters in /r/running are expected to understand that the mod team are people too and doing the best they can to manage a very large sub with frequent posts every day.  If you do not agree with how this sub is moderated, we expect you to do so in a civil manner….and also know when it is time to drop it.

We are very upfront in stating that the sub is heavily moderated, but we do recognize that not every user wants that.  The wonderful thing about reddit is that there are plenty of subs to check out and hopefully find one more to your liking.  If you find the  moderation here too strict, some other related subs with less moderation are /r/runninglifestyle/, /r/BeginnersRunning/, /r/runningquestions/, and /r/Runners/.

###**Recurring Threads**

In order to reduce clutter and nudge you lurkers into posting, we have created a number of daily and weekly threads for you to read, make a comment, or ask a question. Unless you truly believe your new thread will make a new and interesting contribution to Runnit, please wait until the related weekly thread rolls around and post in there instead.  A more complete description of the threads can be [found in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_reccuring_threads).

Here are the current recurring threads with links to the most recent (hopefully) weekly thread:  

*Please note that the search links for the daily threads (Q&A and Achievement) will not work on mobile.  If you are using mobile, sort the sub by ""Hot"" and the current Q&A thread will be stickied at the top.  For the Achievement thread, sort by ""New"" and scroll down a bit to find the current Achievement thread.*

* [Daily Achievement Thread (Posted daily)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=%22achievements+for%22+author%3Aautomoderator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all): Any and all accomplishment posts should be posted here. Anything from new PRs, to longest weekly mileage, to running your first ultra – literally any accomplishments you experienced recently!

* [General Q&A Thread (Posted daily)](https://old.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=Official+Q%26A&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all): With such a large sub, there are a lot of running-related questions that come in every day. In an effort to keep the front page of the sub uncluttered and fresh, we ask you post your questions, particularly those one-off questions that are potentially short and don't necessarily provoke significant discussion, in the daily General Q&A thread.

###**Rules**
We have further [explanations of the rules in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_rules), but as noted in the side bar, please take note of Rule 2 and Rule 7 as they are the ones most cited for post removals.

 **(2)** - *Posts need to generate discussion and/or useful information that other searchers can then benefit from. Low-quality posts, recent reposts, chronically repetitive posts, posts not directly related to running, and questions that are easily answered by FAQ, searching r/running, or Google are subject to removal at the moderation team's discretion.*  

This sub attracts a lot of beginners as well as “drive-by” posting.  A major goal of the sub is to promote quality discussion and develop a community where information and experiences can be shared.  Many of the common questions have been answered, either in previous threads/FAQ, or could easily be answered in the daily Q&A thread.  Yes, circumstances can vary person to person, but it is expected that posters make an attempt to find these answers for themselves before making a stand-alone post.   Visitors should put forth some effort in finding the answer themselves and not expect the Runnit community to do all the work for them.  If the post/question is very specific to your situation (such that other general user won't get much benefit from the information), then it belongs in the daily Q&A thread.

If you do make a stand-alone post, please include info relevant for the community to help.  It is nearly impossible to offer any advice without sufficient background information.  Items that could be relevant:

* Age

* Sex

* Current MPW + pace

* Previous peak MPW

* Workouts you traditionally or recently have completed

* Goals (including specific races)

* Previous PRs

* Other things you think might be helpful to include

Below are some of the reason a post would be considered low-quality, thus being removed and directed to the Daily Q&A thread:

* ""Does anyone else..."" type posts?

* ""Is X a good time for...?"" posts

* If your post is a question in the title (including “See title” or “Title says it all” in the body).

* If your question can be asked in one sentence.

* If your question is very specific to you or your situation.

* If your question can be answered either with a yes/no.

* In general, it is helpful to include something that shows you made an effort to find an answer within the community and thus separate it from the numerous low-effort posts that are submitted every day.  

* Additionally, as rule 5 states, make your title descriptive.  If it is not clear what the post is about or asking, then it will not be useful in later searches.

Finally, while mutual encouragement and sharing of information is a very high priority of r/running, numerous motivational-type and PSA posts are not necessary.  A larger goal of the sub is to provide information to runners, beginners and experienced, which can get drowned out by these types of posts.


 **(7)** - *Do not solicit medical advice. This includes 'Has anyone else experienced this injury?' type posts.*  

While there is some leeway on advice for rehabbing some minor, common running injuries, this sub is not the place for a diagnosis, and especially not for advice on major injuries.  If you are hurt or injured, find a medical professional with the proper credentials to help you.  Not the internet.  

There is a big difference between ""Hey, my IT band is tight. Got any good stretches for it?"" and ""My shins hurt every time I run. If I run through the pain, will it turn into a stress fracture?"" If your question involves sharp pains, unknown/vague pains, or injuries/problems that have stretched on for long periods of time, then it is a question for medical professional.

Also, your doctor not being familiar with running injuries is no excuse.  Find a Sports Medicine doctor, Physical Therapist, or find another doctor.

This is inspired by eric\_twinge's fine work in r/fitness.

Upvote either good or stupid questions. Sort questions by new so that they get some love.

To the more experienced runnitors, if something is a good question or answer, add it to the FAQ.

Post your question -- stupid or otherwise -- here to get an answer -- stupid or otherwise. Anyone can post a question and the community as a whole is invited and encouraged to provide an answer. Many questions get submitted late each week that don't get a lot of action, so if your question didn't get answered, feel free to post it again.

As always, be sure to read the FAQ first. Also, there's a handy-dandy search bar to your right, and if you didn't know, you can also use Google to search runnit by using the limiter ""site:reddit.com r/running"".

Be sure to check back often as questions get posted throughout the day. Sort comments by ""new"" to be sure the newer questions get some love as well.

1loyz6b,Runner beats train to summit of Mount Washington,"[Below, as reported from WMUR in NH](https://www.wmur.com/article/runner-beats-train-summit-mount-washington-cog-joseph-gray/65243873)

""A runner from Colorado beat a train to the top of Mount Washington on Saturday [6/28/25].

Joseph Gray, of Colorado, was among about 400 participants in this year's Race the Cog event. He beat the 9 a.m. Cog Railway train to the top of the summit, according to Northeast Delta Dental President and CEO Tom Raffio.

Raffio said Gray was the only runner to beat the train. He completed the race in 39 minutes and 54 seconds. Gray had to run through fog and light rain on steep terrain to complete the run. By beating the train, he got a $1,000 bonus from Northeast Delta Dental, Raffio said.

Gray also beat the lead Cog train in 2022. Raffio said beating the lead train to the summit has only happened twice during the event, and both times it was Gray who accomplished the feat.

Runners from across the country take part in the Race the Cog event each year. The course starts at the base station of the Cog Railway in Bretton Woods.""

More info:

The race is as follows: ""Runners will take the path alongside the tracks to the summit of Mount Washington racing the cog [railway] the whole way up! The course begins on dirt/gravel where it gradually becomes steeper as you approach Jacobs Ladder which is about a 37% grade. From Jacobs Ladder the runners will begin to experience the large boulder fields that make up the Presidential Range, one of the most technical areas in the country.  The grueling race then concludes on the lofty summit of Mount Washington, finishing a true test of endurance alongside The Cog. The weather can be extreme and vary significantly. Temperatures can be in the 70’s at the base and then snowing at the Summit. "" Mt. Washington's elevation is 6,288 feet. The race course is about 2.75 miles long and follows the tracks the entire way. The total climbing is 3,500 feet with more than 1,000 feet of climbing per mile.",1751368590.0,367,60,running,fitness

# Training

Bit of background for me - I'm in my mid 30s and very active with a lot of running, cycling, hiking, trail running, ice hockey and golfing (walking when I play 99% of the time). The last 6 years I've been a lot more consistent with running as my primary exercise and keeping a decent baseline of fitness. I typically will do at least 1 half marathon race per year and a few other 10k, 10 miler and various trail races to keep things interesting. This would be my second marathon with my first being Jan 2023 which I finished 4hours23minutes.

Since the first full, my running got more consistent and my goal for this was to go sub 4 hours. Through my increased training and other half marathon races I've done, I felt it was achievable but would be tough. My stretch goal was to go sub 3:45, but this was something I didn't really think possible until the race itself.

My friend found this event last year and we planned a vacation to Norway for it. I live in Colorado so the altitude for training would give me an advantage here as well as this is at sea level. For those not in the know, the race takes place in the arctic circle in a small town called Tromso way up north in Norway (highly recommend visiting if you can!). They do it on June 21st on the summer solstice when the sun never sets and the race starts at 9pm. It was quite bizarre to a) have a race that takes place at night like this but b) be running in complete sunlight at what should be night time. There are huge parties that go on all over Norway during the summer solstice but Tromso especially was wild with the race going on too.

After deciding to sign up, my goal was officially to go sub 4 hours. I built a 4ish month plan running 5x per week starting in March based on something I found on the runnersworld site. I got some advice on my plan from some people in my run club who are more seasoned which was awesome and helped a lot.

The weather in Colorado can be unpredictable in the spring, but thankfully it was mostly good for training and only had a few days where I was forced to use a treadmill. My baseline mileage before starting was about 15-20 miles per week so I did not have any issues with the training. My rest days I would try to do some dedicated stretching and light weight lifting to give my legs a rest. Generally speaking, each week was broken down into this:

Monday: Rest

Tuesday: Tempo or Interval Run

Wednesday: Easy Run at varying distance or time

Thursday: Tempo or Hills

Friday: Rest or cross training with yoga/weights

Saturday: 30minutes easy run

Sunday: Long run - 8 miles all the way up to 20 miles then tapering back down a few weeks out

I was able to stick to this format for the most part and only had some slight knee pain towards the end on really big weeks which I would then adjust distances on the other runs as to not over train.

Near the end of the block in May, I ran a half marathon race which I substituted a long run for to get a baseline of where I was fitness wise and double check nutrition/gear. The race could not have gone better and I finished in 1hour53minutes and had plenty of gas in the tank left afterwards. This gave me serious confidence I was on the right track and wouldn't have any issues on the full.

Nutrition wise I've been using the same gels, gummies and recovery drinks the past few years so none of that was new for my body thankfully. I also was somehow able to stay healthy and not get sick at all during the training block which was a huge blessing.

# Pre-race

We flew into Europe the Wednesday before the Saturday race to give us plenty of time to get on schedule there and get some rest. Sleep was interesting with the sun not setting basically at all, but the 2 days before the race I was able to get 2 nights of 8 hours proper and feel good. We spend 1.5 days in Oslo where I did a 2 mile shakeout run, then after arriving in Tromso Friday AM I did a quick 1.5 mile run there as well with a local run club.

As this again was a night time race (yet in the sunlight) starting at 830PM, I was a little lost at first of how to handle logistics. I wanted to make sure I was properly fueled, but not too full so I came up with this idea: Day of the race, have a big breakfast, moderate size pasta lunch, then a snack later in the day. I didn't want to have a big dinner right before and be too full or risk GI issues during the race. I also tried to hydrate throughout the day with a few nuun tablets, stay off my feet as much as possible and try to have a quick nap. Thankfully I got good night sleep the day before and slept in a bit, followed by an epic breakfast buffet at hour hotel (European breakfast buffets FTW!)

We met up with our friends for some pastries and coffee an hour after that and then rested for a few hours. I had a nice pasta dish for lunch around 2pm with some bread and my 2nd nuun tablet/water there. Following lunch we went back to the hotel and I tried to take a quick nap and get some rest in. The pre-race nerves started kicking in and I couldn't nap so I started getting my race clothes ready and gels/bib in order. About 6pm I ate a banana and some leftover pastries which were nice and stretched for about 30 minutes.

This is where I can really appreciate morning races because from here, I still had an hour and a half until start time with not much to do. My stomach was starting to act up due to nerves so had to deal with that as well and try to rehydrate a bit. For gels I had 6 Gu Roctane's with me for the race. 3 with caffeine (strawberry kiwi) and 3 without (lemonade). These are the same ones and amount I used on my first marathon and it worked out super well for me. I use the same on half races (2 instead of 6) and also trained with these on my long runs too so my body was well ready for them.

Luckily, the start line was about 500ft from our hotel so I didn't have to stress about getting there at all. About 30 minutes prior to start time I got dressed, put some vaseline on the bits and armpits, had a bit more water and went down to stretch and get lined up.

The weather was a bit of a toss up too for me as it was forecast to be between 44F and 51F during the race and humid. Typically, i'll wear just lined shorts and a tank top but I was between that and a heavier t-shirt due to the wind/temps. I ended up going with the tank which I later regretted, but for the most part worked out. I did a quick jog around the block to get the legs warmed up and some final stretches then got situated for the start. There were no starting groups, just markers for finish times so I got near the 345-4h marker.

# Race

Lined up for the start I was feeling good, temperatures were nice in the high 40s, felt ready to attack the course at sea level. The start line was next to the local cruise port so as the countdown hit 1, the cruise ship docked blasted its horn which was a nice little touch. The first mile goes through downtown Tromso with loads of people lined on the streets, then immediately turns to go up and over the famous [Tromso bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troms%C3%B8_Bridge). It's not a ton of incline but still right at the start I was aiming to go intentionally slower then blast down it to continue on course at my planned pace.

My planned pace for the race was around 8min50s miles and trying to start out a little slower than that due to the incline. My first few splits ended up being 8:49 (+127ft gain), 7:56 (-133ft), followed by \~8m30s miles until mile 17. My heart rate was in a really good place too so I decided not to modify things and push on at this pace despite being a bit faster than I wanted. The elevation outside of the bridge was pretty steady and the temperatures remained great from what I could feel. My watch pace alerts were yelling at me, but I pushed through and surprised myself with how easy the miles were coming and going.

The first slight issue I had was that after maybe mile 3 or so I was getting hungry and realizing I should have possibly eaten a little more. From past experiences I know its better to get ahead of hunger on course so I took my first gel around 25 minutes into the race vs the 40 minute mark which I planned. This kind of threw me off schedule with the gel and I got in my head about this. My hunger eventually went away, but the aid stations with water were at odd intervals (or so it felt) so it became difficult to manage the timing with those. I eventually was able to turn off my pace alerts that were interrupting my music which was good.

The 2nd issue faced was my big toe on my right foot catching the front of my shoe in a weird way. These were my Altra Vanish Carbon race shoes which I've wore for a half marathon and about 15 miles or so otherwise of training so they were well broken in. The socks I was wearing I had worn before too so this was something totally new and unexpected. Managed to push through but it was pretty painful the last 10 miles or so and here I am 9 days later with a black toenail which will surely come off.

The course was absolutely gorgeous. I probably lost a few minutes fiddling with my phone to take photos and videos but i'm glad I did. It was so surreal running through the nordic countryside with stunning views of mountains and the water everywhere. There were also tons of locals outside their houses and flats with Norway flags, bonfires going, and people passing out beers and shots.

Thankfully once I was on course my body didn't really register what time it was at all and I was locked in on the race. After hitting the half marathon marker and seeing I was at 1hour 50 and getting a PR there, I knew that sub 4 or better was definitely possible. I tried to let off the gas a little bit as I knew it would be tougher towards the end as it was during my first marathon. With some elevation in favor, I continued around the 8m30s pace until mile 17 or so then as I returned to cross the bridge again I pulled back to 9m+ miles for the remaining.

Mile 20, like in my first marathon, was again a big struggle moment knowing I still had another 6 to go. I passed some of our friends watching which gave me some temporary energy but it was quickly gone as fatigue set in, the toe pain got worse, and the gels started to not settle well. It's hard to remember exactly, but I took my last caffeine gel around mile 20 and it seemed to sit in my upper chest and not really go down. This is something I've not really had happen ever during a race or training so I was lost on what to do. I walked the 2nd to last aid station to try and get it down but it still wasn't quite right. Feeling weak and knowing I was slowing, I tried the last gel at mile 23 and the last aid station and that one too didn't go down well. I ended up not finishing the gel and throwing some sports mix on top to push it down which didn't work either.

My last 3 miles were \~10min10seconds and very painful. I was genuinely trying to just keep my feet moving and not puke on the side of the course. I slowly got into downtown where the finish was and felt worse and worse. I saw my wife and friends near the finish cheering me on as I passed through the finish line and stopped my watch. I was briefly so stoked about my time but I immediately felt terrible as the endorphins died off.

# Post-race

I slowly collected my medal, extra ripe banana and cold bottle of water and tried to find a place to sit down. I drank the cold water trying to catch my breath and decide if I was going to puke or not while my friends and wife came to congratulate me. At this point, my body started to drop in temperature as it was close to 40f now and I was in wet shorts and a tank from the sweat. I sat there for 5 minutes as my buddy got me a cup of warm water from a nearby store which helped a lot. I was dizzy, nauseous, freezing and wet. I questioned if I pushed too hard or was just dressed poorly and didn't eat enough, but at that point I just wanted to get out of there.

We took a few photos, hobbled back to the hotel where I ultimately puked up the last 2 gels and a lot of water. I've never puked after any running event or physical event for that matter so that was new to me. Immediately my stomach felt better thankfully and I was able to get down my tailwind recovery drink with some bread and take a hot shower. At that point, the stoke came back and I couldn't stop smiling that I smashed my goal of finishing sub 4 and all the hard work paid off.

All in all, I would HIGHLY recommend this event to anyone who can make it up to Tromso. It's by far one of the most beautiful places I've ever been to and the event was great from start to finish. The training block I did was a huge success and I am super thrilled with the result and hitting personal bests in almost all categories for me. I told myself after the first marathon I wasn't sure if i'd do another, but after this one I'm almost certain I've got more in me.",1751319228.0,48,19,running,fitness

I fill my soft flasks and Hydrapak \~75% full, freeze them overnight, and then fill the rest on the morning of my run.

1llqb4m,Unique case of runners toe.. help!,"Hello, I’m relatively new to running, but my big toe nails, specifically ONLY on the INNER side of the big toe nail (next to 2nd toe) are getting purple and very painful. I’d estimate about 1/3 of the nail is turning purple, area closest to 2nd toe. It happens on both feet.

I’ve been trying to solve this issue for months and can’t find any discussions of someone having this specific issue. I’ve tried 3 different sizes of shoes, tons of socks, but it’ll still happen even after a 5-6 mile run. I have other foot issues too like blisters but recently found some relief from Balega Blister resist. Thicker sock seems to help way better than the thin feetures. I’ve also tried different shoe brands and Hokas have been the best, although I’m open to trying something new again if needed.

I tried the heel lock method but that made my heel hurt because it was so tight. I am almost 100% confident this issue is not caused by my toes hitting the front of the shoe because otherwise it would be the whole nail, or at least the front. Anybody have a clue what’s going on? I keep my toe nails very trim, and I don’t have this issue on any other toes whatsoever.

I’ve been contemplating trying the silicon toe caps. Would this have something to do with insoles? Why is this happening only after a few miles? It’s stopping me from progressing in distance.

I have not been running consistently, but every now and then I keep going back to it, while also doing other forms of excercise.

I am now a mom to a 2 YO and I find that running is the easiest way to get some excercise, so I am getting more and more into it. I still use Runningt by Adidas, but I am not too happy with the training programs they have on the app.

I read somewhere that they were planning on phasing it out at some point in 2025.

On the positive side though it is a completely free to use app, as I bought it once and do not have an ongoing subscription. 

  
So my dilemma is I would like to try another running app, that might be better at tracking and with better training programs (I have done 5k and 10k runs in the past, and would love to try a half marathon!), but at the same time, is it really worth getting a subscription app just for a small improvement?

1lhz5er,I want to stop using so much sunscreen. Any recommendations for a lightweight/breathable/UV-protective jacket or sun shirt with a pocket for phone?,"**tl;dr: any suggestions for a lightweight breathable sun shirt or jacket that has a pocket for an iPhone 14 Pro, that I can wear while running in hot/sunny conditions (\~25-35C/80s-90sF)?**

Hello,

I'm looking for a jacket or sun shirt that I can wear while running when it's really hot and sunny. I'm trying to decrease my sunscreen usage. I would like to wear only a sports bra under the jacket or shirt on these hot days.

**Desired features:**

\- weight: 110g or less  
\- hood  
\- sleeves I can pull over my hands (thumb loop is nice but not required - I'll just pull the sleeves all the way down)  
\- pocket that fits iPhone 14 Pro or something similarly sized, and which won't wildly bounce around (my usual running pants don't have pockets)  
\- high albedo, I want protection from UV exposure  
\- breathable  
\- I figure I'm going to be a sweaty mess if the temp is high, so it's okay if sweat builds up inside and stays on me (the fabric contributes to humidity)

**I've tried on:**

\- [Dooy Sun Protection Jacket](https://www.amazon.com/Dooy-Cycling-Protection-Windbreaker-Windproof/dp/B07ZM8NWCH) in white and gray colors - I looked like I was wearing a trash bag.  
\- [Patagonia Airshed Pro Pullover](https://www.patagonia.com/product/womens-airshed-pro-running-windbreaker-pullover/24197.html) in Wispy Green color - It worked well enough, and I like that it can zip over my mouth (more sun protection coverage). However, the one annoyance is that the chest pocket is so roomy that when I zip the bottom chest zipper up (to allow for airflow), my phone flops around wildly (it still flops around a lot when I have the chest zipped fully shut). Also, not sure the fabric actually protects me from the sun?  
\- [Arcteryx Incendo Airshell Hoody](https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/womens/incendo-airshell-hoody) in Arctic Silk color - This had more airflow than the Patagonia Airshed because it was looser in the torso. Hand pockets held my phone pretty well. Not sure if it actually protects me from the sun? Anyway, no huge complaints with this jacket, but it's $240. If I can't find anything else that checks off all the above boxes, then I guess I have to wear a $240 jacket. I'd be so worried that I'd rip a hole in a $240 jacket (the fabric is ""lightweight nylon ripstop with DWR finish provides light weather resistance / Double weave textile for all day comfort and durability / Clean finished seams""). On the other hand, what is skin protection worth to me? A lot.

**I haven't ordered/tried on but have looked at:**

[Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell](https://blackdiamondequipment.com/products/w-distance-wind-shell) \- This seems sort of similar to the Arcteryx. I confirmed that the pocket fits my phone. The Glacier color (teal) probably has higher albedo than the Blue Ash color (gray).  
[Nathan Stealth Jacket 2.0](https://nathansports.com/products/womens-stealth-jacket-2-0?variant=40623032270936) \- I confirmed this pocket does not fit my phone.  
[Salomon Sense Aero Wind](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/shop/product/sense-aero-wind-lc12979.html) \- I confirmed this pocket does not fit my phone.  
[Janji Sunchaser 50 Hooded Long Sleeve](https://janji.com/products/ws-sunchaser-50-hooded-long-sleeve) \- This lacks a pocket and it weighs 150g. But reviews say it's great for running in the sun. But I really would like a pocket so I don't have to carry my phone in my hand the whole time.

Thank you so much for any insight you can share.",1750627636.0,33,80,running,fitness

### Preamble
The Manitoba Marathon? That seemed perfect. I was scrolling through a list of races 7-9 weeks in the future, trying to lift my sprits after cancelling everything for Boston 2025. 

In 2022 the Manitoba Marathon was my first attempt at the distance. I went into it with big goals – sub 3 and BQ – my pair of trusty Nike Pegasus and no idea what I was doing. As it turns out my lack of preparation somehow wasn’t what doomed me, as the race was stopped after about 90 minutes due to extreme heat. I would go on to finish the course, but the timing equipment had been turned off and I received no official time and was listed as a DNF. That felt harsh.
 
Three years later with maybe slightly more of a clue about running and even bigger goals it seemed like good symmetry. Or at least a good story. 

### Training
I registered 9 weeks before the race. Boston was scuttled because a significant issue with my IT band and quad. Disappointing as it was to miss that race, I wasn’t willing to the risk of not addressing it early and, with the injury hitting right at the start of my taper, I thought I had the opportunity to salvage my fitness. Recovery, with support from a physio, left me 6 weeks to execute a mini build and taper for Winnipeg.

My plan was focused on sharpening my existing fitness and staying healthy enough to give a good effort on race day. I wanted to hit some key workouts to gauge my progress along the way both in terms of fitness and how my body was holding up: 
Week 1: 20 miler with 15mi easy and 5 at MP
Week 2: Half-Marathon race a little faster than MP
Week 3: 20 mile LR workout feature 6x1mi repeats at threshold
Week 4: Half-Marathon race at HMP

The two half-marathon races were already on my calendar, so I’m not sure if they were ideal but they were fun races that I didn’t want to miss out on. I had physio session at the end of each week to make sure I was still on track and otherwise just ran based on how I felt. After the end of week 4 I went into my taper, with only a little more tempo work before the race. My last proper workout was 10 days out.

### Pre-Race
I flew out to Winnipeg on the Friday, two days before the race, with my Wife and Mother In-law who came out to visit some family and visit around Winnipeg for the weekend. In the past I’ve maybe been guilty of overdoing it in the days before a race, so I mostly spent the warm afternoons inside and off my feet. Friday and Saturday I ran an easy 5kms with a few strides on Saturday and got a few walks in, but otherwise rested. 

Sunday – race day – I woke up shortly after 4am to for some coffee and breakfast. I’m apparently slow to digest so even with just a piece of toast, jam and banana the early start was normal and necessary. I sipped on some Maurten caf 320 on the drive down to the start. 

I arrived with about 1:20 minutes before the start. To help manage my ITBS I had a lengthy warmup and stretching routine to go through. Somehow that took even longer than expected, and by the time I had my race shoes tied up and gels tucked away I could hear ‘O Canada’ being performed at the starting line. 

Normally I’m pathologically early to the point of comedy, so feeling late was uncomfortable. I jogged up to the start corral with few minutes to spare to realize that I had no idea how to get in. In the distance I could vaguely see a point where people were entering but it was far back and I’m not one to try and push my back up to my assigned corral. A runner in front of me was in the same predicament and recruited some help to hop the barrier. I grit my teeth and followed him over – without help – clambering over the short steel fence without much dignity and landing way to hard on my Endorphin Elite 2s, “bottoming out” the soft foam. Shoes not necessarily made for jumping – noted. 

### Race
The race went off and after reassuring myself that I hadn’t wrecked my shoes I was eager to settle into an early rhythm, aiming for even splits on the flat course. About 150 meters in I heard something clatter to the ground nearby, turned and realized one of my Caf 100s had fallen from my pocket. Not ideal for my nutrition plan but also painfully expensive, especially since the Caf 100s aren’t available in Canada. I buried my second one further in the pocket, an action I’d forget 25km later when I reached for it, couldn’t find it, and assumed I lost that one too. 

Early on I tucked in with a pack of five including a local runner - the greetings and cheers he exchanged with spectators gave me away - a youngster clearly running well slower than his fitness, two running much faster than their fitness, and myself. 
Somewhere around the 5km mark we were set to make a turn onto one of the large boulevards with a traffic lane coned off for runners. Only this lane hadn’t be closed yet. A police officer directed us onto the sidewalk, calling unhelpfully from behind, “don’t worry, they are closing it now.”  

I could only laugh at the symmetry between this and the 2022 race when we had also initially been directed onto the sidewalk after the race was cancelled. After about 1km we rejoined a now closed road.

A large deer crossed our path as we entered Assiniboine Park, and we briefly became a pack of 7 when we picked up a runner who’d fallen off the lead pack and a spectator started running beside us while clapping and (hopefully) cheering in a language I didn’t understand.

On the other end of the park, I dropped back a little when the young fast runner sped up and the others attempted to follow. The runner who had dropped from the lead pack fell back next, followed by another who had be labouring for some time. We passed 25km and I started to feel tightness in my right quad. That was supposed to be my good side, but it didn’t seem too serious yet. I was sure I could make it to 32km and then I’d see what I had left. 

The young fast runner was long gone and so was the pack of five. The local was still about 20 meters ahead but the others were out of site behind before 30km. At 32km the local fell back to me. I checked my time and decided, since quad hadn’t gotten any worse, to make a short push. During my last marathon (Marine Corps 2025) I’d gone through 32km feeling very strong but faded badly over the last 5. I was resolved to hold my pace as best I could this time. 

I can’t remember exactly when it started but a patchwork of runners from other distances began populating the course. A 5k, 10k and Half-Marathon were being run at the same time, and now that I was nearing the finish I’d be running through the slower parts of those races. In the cancelled 2022 race the only other runners I remember over the last few kilometers were faster marathoners who’d burned themselves out in the heat and were now walking in. This time around I weaved, dipped and ducked through the thicker crowds and narrowing course. I became more frustrated in my desperation to maintain what momentum I could and worried about also running an 8-year-old down from behind. At 40km I ran into a woman who abruptly stepped in front of me to give a spectator a high-five.

The race finishes at the University/CFL stadium. Having picked my way through the crowd I made a right hand turn into the finishing chute that led into the stadium and onto the field. Instinctively I followed the runners ahead onto the left-hand side of the coned-off chute, wondering the whole time who thought it was a good idea to make me run through this mass of humanity.

 I stepped across the line, veered towards a volunteer who handed me a medal, doubled over and stopped my watch. The clock when I finished read 2:39 and change, but that I was for the half-marathon. Did it start 5 minutes later? I checked my watch. 2:44:45. Under the goal.

### Post-race
All my previous marathons have had distinct moments that live clear as day in my memory. At L.A it’s watching the mass of runners charge down the street from the top of Vin Scully Ave, at Erie 2 it’s the Banana Man who I had to pull back onto the timing mat, and  at Boston 2024 it’s dying on the crest of heartbreak and the kind woman who told me not to give up when she saw me about to stop and walk. What I hope to remember from this race is the image of my wife cutting through the crowd to get to me.

 “You did it!”, she said, her eyes shining with sympathetic joy. 

I asked if she knew my chip tip. 2:44:25. 

“That’s under your goal,” she reminded me, “and I bet you would have been faster if you’d gone down the marathon finish on the right-hand side, dummy.” 

A fitting mistake and another opportunity to be grateful. This was a good day.

This marathon was SO hard but taught me SO much about finding joy when things don’t go to plan and trying to avoid an all or nothing/results orientated mindset!

Training:
I followed the pfitz 18/55 program. I got so fixated on improving in something that I was finally passionate about, after being a hobby hopper all my life! I knew it’d be a challenge, especially for how slow I am running, but I knew my body could recover pretty well. I got lucky with the weather for the most part and felt good all throughout my training! I had to decrease the mileage on some weeks but still ran an average of 40 miles/week, never missed a day except when sick, ran 3 20 milers and my last 20 miler, i did 5 miles, then 10 miles at goal marathon pace (9:09), followed by 5 miles. I felt good! Garmin was predicting a 3:57, and I knew garmin was pretty accurate for me based on my last race. However for like the week leading up to the race, I was so nervous! I’ve never thought about myself as a nervous person before…but i was getting worse quality sleep and stomachaches. First lesson learned, I shouldn’t have had a pace goal for my first marathon!!


Pre-race

I didn’t run at all the week before the marathon, just because i was kind of feeling burnt out from running, and I wanted to be extra fresh for race day! I probably would’ve ran if it wasn’t for the heat wave in the twin cities right now…
I got 6 hours of sleep and woke up to the race being delayed 30 minutes. At this point I just wanted to survive and have fun, so I adjusted my goal time to 4:10 based on a heat-training calculator. Oh yeah…this race was hotttt! It fluctuated a lot but the last 6 miles of the race were in the low to mid 80s. 

Race

So one thing about me is…I’ve never done well in the heat, I almost never go a day without sweating even in the winter. So I’ve been getting up at like 5am for the past month to run, and so far I haven’t had to run in temps over 75 and most were under 60 (all the long runs were cool too). That’s just how I like it and how I will actually enjoy running, because otherwise what’s the point! I guess it’ll never be perfect though, because if I do a summer marathon then my training will be ideal, but then the marathon might be really hot and vice versa for a fall marathon. I guess a winter marathon would be ideal, but they don’t really exist in Minnesota lol. Anyway, first mile and BAM 185 heart rate at a 9:19 pace and my garmin says i’m at a -6 performance readiness and I’m drenched in sweat. I also have to pee bc i’ve been downing water at the start line and the lines for the portas were so long, so I only got to go like an hour before the race started. It also just feels…weird to be running but I figured I was just warming up.
9:30 pace was feeling comfortably hard, despite my HR averaging in the high 180s (max is around 202). Lesson 2, I just need to buy shokz man…my beats headphones kept slipping from all the sweat which wasn’t really a problem before. I took gels every 3 miles and water at basically every aid station. Around mile 16 was when it got a lot harder to hold the 9:30s so I’m like ok that’s way earlier than I would fatigue on my long runs but that’s chill, I’ll do 10:30s. There was a moderate hill at around mile 21, I was able to slowly run up it, then run the downhill that followed but after that it got sooo much harder! This was also when it got a lot hotter because we weren’t getting the wind off lake superior anymore. My hamstrings probably hurt the most, my upper back and stomach too. Before, I would briefly walk through the aid stations but now I was walking through the entirety of the aid stations and at other parts too. I’ve never felt that much fatigue from running it’s crazy! I thought Id feel that as I was booking it to the finish line but nope…those 11:30s got handsssss. This was so different from the half marathons I’ve done, I’ve always had something left in me to do a fast last 5k and mile and sprint to the finish, but this one I had nothing left in me! I thought maybe there was some kind of mental barrier since I could sprint finish before, so I tried to pick it up at mile 25 because if I finished the last two miles in under 20 minutes I could maybe break 4:30 but nope, that wasn’t happening either. At this point I was a bit confused about how my body was feeling and just because of how far off my time was going to be, even though I quit looking at my watch a while ago. All the volunteers and cheerers were amazing though it was so wholesome! I loved the live music, dancers, and some people I didn’t even know looked at me and cheered my name! In any other scenario I’d be creeped out but I was just so happy at that point. One thing that I was glad I did was take out my headphones once I got to duluth because it was so fun! My heart goes out to the people experiencing dehydration or other medical problems, as there were quite a few, I hope you’re ok!

Post-race: My hamstrings are so sore! But otherwise I’m very happy I did it. I’m a marathoner!! One thing I was struggling with afterwards was the slight disappointment of training at specific paces and running on average 8 hours a week+2/3 hrs of cross training (with a few 10 hour weeks too) and not even being close to my goal. Im so used to setting goals, that’s how I motivate myself to do anything. But with a marathon, especially a first one, just showing up and doing the best you can is enough. I know one hard race doesn’t negate all the work I did, but idk it’s hard not to think about it like that. I just have to remind myself how lucky I am that I get to do this. Also comparing time trained to race time is just a recipe for bitterness and jealousy, definitely still need to work on that i’ll admit it. I guess that was lesson 3 and 4?

Disclaimer: you should always check with your OB-GYN wether running is an appropriate form of exercise for you and take it easy postpartum until you are cleared to exercise again.

Running shape before I got pregnant: ran between 1-3 times every week for years, participating in one half marathon race every spring for the past 10 years, best half marathon time is 2 hours 3 minutes, worst is 2 hours 17 minutes. I'd call myself a consistent but slow runner.

Adjustments while I was pregnant to keep running:

1. No morning runs before breakfast. This was a big adjustment for me, since I usually trained early in the morning. But having low blood sugar while exercising when you're pregnant is not fun (it makes morning sickness symptoms worse) and not a strain you want to put on your body.
2. Invest in a good quality maternity belt. Think of it like a sports bra for your growing belly. It reduces the discomfort of your belly bouncing up and down on your bladder and pulling on your muscles and ligaments.
3. Don't exceed 140 bpm heart rate. This was the recommended max heart rate from my OB Gyn, I used a smart watch to track my heart rate. Most of the time I did not have the energy to push myself harder than that rate anyways, the only exceptions were running up hill and running at a higher altitude.
4. Find a different way to stay fit once running is no longer an option. At 7 months I had to throw in the towel because running went from uncomfortable to painful. I am lucky enough to have easy access to a pool, so I started swimming 30 minutes every day instead. This was amazing for two reasons: I stayed fit so I had the energy to go through labor (which they say is the equivalent of running a marathon) and I got all the happy effects of swimming (getting my heart rate up, feeling weightless, cooling down).

Actions I took postpartum:

1. Walk every day until cleared for other exercise. The first six weeks are very limited in what's allowed, I was advised to only go for walks and slowly increase the distance I walked, which is what I did. I started with walks around the block and slowly increased them to walking for an hour or two each day with the baby in the stroller. Also a great way to get indirect sunlight for the baby to help them overcome their jaundice.
2. Buy myself a new pair of running shoes with extra cushioning. I gained 40 lbs when pregnant and quickly lost about 25 lbs in the first few weeks postpartum. That still puts me at 15 lbs over my pre pregnancy weight and the extra cushioning helps my knees and ankles feel better. I also treated myself to a new pair of walking shoes to make my daily walks more comfy as well. Definitely worth the investment.
3. Buy myself new running shorts that fit comfortably for my new body. I might lose the weight I gained, but the best way to do that is by exercising and I feel more motivated when my clothes fit well and are not too tight. Worth spending a couple of dollars on shorts I will wear constantly for the next couple of months.
4. Stretch stretch stretch. Constant walking made my glutes and upper thigh muscles pretty tight, which is not good for my lower back. Doing a daily yoga routine of cat cow, reverse pigeon and supine twists really helped my back. I also pay more attention to the position of my pelvis and the tightening of my abs when walking and running to prevent myself from training with a hollow back (9 months of having a belly pull your spine forward requires some active focus to get your posture back).

The result: I went for a run the day I was cleared for exercise at six weeks postpartum. It was amazing. I ran for 30 minutes straight at 10:30 per mile. I felt like I was flying around the trail and I was so happy to be able to run again I kept taking little sprints. Afterwards I felt great. The next day I was a bit stiff and my next run was significantly slower at 11:30 per mile. Since I've been cleared I've ran roughly every other day and I'm fairly confident I'll be able to run a half marathon in fall.

1lf5ubx,Broløbet: the bridge run (half marathon),"“Run across the bridge.” That was the pitch for this unusual run, the bridge in this case being the Øresund Bridge between Copenhagen, Denmark and Malmo, Sweden, on the 25th anniversary of its official dedication in summer 2000. This was the third such run, the first having 79,719 finishers on 12 June 2000, still the world’s largest half marathon; and the second with around 30,000 runners in June 2010.

Someone in our running club mentioned it early in 2024. The first adventure was signing up; tickets went on sale on 1st February 2024 and sold out 40,000 tickets in a few hours, with the web site barely functioning under the load. Nevertheless a dozen of us signed up; and 18 months later arrived in Copenhagen, city of parks and bicycles, ready to run.

The run was organized by two running clubs, Sparta Atletik in Denmark and MAI (Malmö Allmänna Idrottsförening) in Sweden. There were expos in both countries, with the Copenhagen one conveniently positioned by Fælledparken parkrun where some of us ran on the Saturday before the race. Bib pickup was as the expo, which was fun with a nameboard showing all the runners, discounted shoes and other goodies. Along with the bib, runners were given a handy folding bag which was required for bag drop.
I had not trained specifically for this run, taking the view that I would still be fit enough following Manchester Marathon at the end of April. In fact my fitness has dropped a bit but not disastrously so. I had signed up for the 1:30 – 1:40 wave and was nervous about completing it in the time but figured this race was more about the experience than chasing a PB (personal best). This put me in the third wave (yellow), starting at 9:50, though bag was to be dropped by 8:45.

Being a get-there-early sort of person, I arrived around 8:00am at which time it was easy to use the facilities and have a wander round; not much to see other than the gathering runners and a stand from sponsor Boozt. Weather was sunny and we had been warned of a warm race so slathered myself with suncream and did my best to hydrate. Organization until this point had been fine but there were a few issues in the start area; not enough portaloos was the biggest problem.

We left the pen shortly after 9:50 as planned. This was not the start though; we were walked around some roads and waited a bit, so Garmin tells me the actual start was 10:26. The course ran through Kastrup and then down into the tunnel that precedes the bridge. It was warm until we entered the tunnel, then nice running conditions in the shade of the tunnel, busy with runners but not too congested. My first miles were the fastest, then it was a gentle uphill out of the tunnel and towards the bridge. As we emerged from the tunnel there was a noticeable headwind but the sky was overcast and it was not as warm as expected, phew!

By the time we got onto the bridge proper it was about half way through the race. Plenty of water stations with drinks in cardboard cartons; quite good for holding though I am not good at drinking much while running. The course did not allow for much in the way of spectators though stationary traffic on the other half of the bridge gave us some honks and cheers.

The nature of the course is that you have a long gentle climb until you reach the centre of the bridge, and then a long gentle downhill to the finish. I should have been able to speed up more than I did, but not being in peak condition I continued at just over 7:30 mile pace. Coming into Sweden and off the bridge there were spectators and some nice crowd support. Then into the park, past a sign that said “200m to shine”, and a little kick at the end to finish on 1:39:34, just within my start wave prediction, 2895 of 40230 runners, and 6th of 340 in my age group VM65.

The finish area at this point was busy but not too crowded. I received my medal and banana, got a free “selfie” from a Boozt stand, and wandered through the finish field looking for the bag trucks which turned out to be at the far end. Then I returned to the finish in search of friends and family.

Oh dear! I am not sure exactly when things started to go wrong, but the runners finishing at what should have been just under two hours, and later, were not able to run over the line because of congestion. They were forced to walk to the finish, with some complaining of 10-15 minutes wait; frustrating for those aiming to beat 2 hours. The reason was that the immediate finish area was not being cleared of runners fast enough; I remember from Manchester (a mere 30,000 runners) that this needs to be done quite aggressively by marshals otherwise you get exactly this problem.
The situation was worse because there was no segregation in the finish area between runners and general spectators so it was hard to move through the crowd. There should have been a sizeable runner-only area at the finish allowing a clear space to move into after completion.

Another common complaint was lack of signage, particularly to the bag collection area. Bag collection was fine for me; I was served by the same person who picked up my bag first thing in the morning. Later on though things fell apart; the trucks were apparently out of numerical order, bags were strewn around, spectators were allowed into the bag collection area and some thefts were reported.

Worse still was the transport away from the finish. There were coaches both back to Copenhagen, or to the nearest train station at Hyllie. There were no organized queues but lines formed, though with no real clarity as to which line was for which coach, and some ignoring the lines and heading straight for the road side. There were not enough coaches, and it began to be whispered that a collision on the bridge had delayed the Copenhagen coaches. Mobile internet or even voice calls barely worked so communication was poor.

Many of us took what seemed to be the least bad option, a 5KM walk to Hyllie, despite a friend messaging “don’t come to Hyllie” because of overcrowded platforms and lack of sufficient trains. For us, once we got to Hyllie all was well and we stepped straight onto a train to Copenhagen and even got seats.

This was not good though and many of the problems seemed to be avoidable, particularly the organization of the finish area, lack of finish area marshals, lack of communication, and shortage of food and water during the long enforced wait for transport.

Of course all these problems soon fade from memory; it was a fantastic run and an unforgettable experience. Nobody knows when or if there will be another bridge run and I am glad to have been part of it.

Plan is to do a 5k race every 4-6 weeks to keep me motivated. However, what I’m starting to realise is I’m just feeling perpetually… underwhelmed? Disappointed? I don’t know the right term. 

Regardless of how much I improve, I just can’t feel happy about it. When I started back running in February, I was doing a 28 minute 5k. By my first race in May, I was down to 24:56. My PB from 2024 was 24:32, so I wasn’t happy with that. I started training properly (intervals, etc. which I had never done) with the goal of going sub 24 by my next race in late June. I got 23:18, well under my target… and I was just disappointed I didn’t get sub-23. Everyone was celebrating, people delighted going sub 30, sub 28 etc. and I was just there being like “right, not good enough. Sub 22:30 by July race”.

Set a goal, beat it, be disappointed, set new goal.

It’s a cycle, and I just want to know is it typical? Do you ever feel content with your running? Or is it always “must do better”? I don’t mind it, I just thought I’d feel happy with each milestone and I don’t. ",1750285010.0,147,120,running,fitness

\### Training

I came off a spring marathon a few months ago, and mostly focused on hill training between the marathon and this event.  I did one trail 22-miler about a month before the race, and I did a couple of hilly 15-16 milers on roads.  The race only had about 6k feet of vert over the 50 miles, so it actually wasn't insane.  I turned out to be pretty prepared with minimal training outside of a good marathon block--at no point in the race was my fitness a serious problem.  



\### Pre-race

My husband drove me to the park (we live about an hour away), dropped me off with my stuff, and then went to a hotel where he would be spending the night in a moderately comfy bed while I ran around in the woods.  The race was set up as a loop of about 26 miles, which you run twice.  I had two drop bags.  One was at the start/finish area, which I passed at mile 26, and one was at the other main aid station, which I passed at miles 10, 13, 37, and 40.  I had a bunch of snacks in each bag, consisting of dried fruit, those little fruit pouch thingys that you give to toddlers, rice krispie treats, and super sour scandinavian swimmers (they're the trader joe's version of sour patch kids, they're amazing).  I also had a ton of electrolyte packs, although I ended up only using 4 of the 12 that I brought.



\### Race

The race was super well-organized, and it started just a few minutes after 6pm on Saturday.  It was pretty hot at the start, maybe low 80s and humid.  It got much cooler starting around 7:30.  The first 15 or so miles were super uneventful.  I hit the first aid station at mile 10, snarfed down a Reese's cup and some watermelon, ran the 3-mile loop and came back to the aid station and snarfed down another Reese's cup and some more watermelon, along with a couple of quesadilla wedges.  By this point the sun has gone down and I've pulled out my headlamp.



At mile 15, it starts to rain.  Torrential rain. My eyes kept stinging and my sweat rag was the only item of fabric on my person that did not have bug spray on it, so I kept using that to wipe my eyes.  My glasses had so much water on them that I couldn't see very well, and the rain was obscuring visibility as well.  Needless to say, this stretch of the race kind of sucked.



It was still raining when I rocked up to the start/finish/halfway point.  I had a full change of clothes (including socks, shoes, and underwear) in my drop bag there.  I decided to change despite the rain, on the grounds that for one brief, glorious moment, I would be dry.  As it happened, in the 7 minutes that it took me to change clothes, the rain stopped.  I have literally never been so happy in my \*life\* to see the weather clear up.  I hung out at the aid station for a few minutes, ate some boiled potatoes and another Reese's cup, refilled my snacks, and headed back out.  



Around mile 28, I briefly got lost.  There was a stream crossing that I hadn't remembered (on rocks, no getting wet involved), and at 1am I could not for the life of me figure out where to go.  Some dude came up behind me when I'd been wandering around confused for about 5 minutes and showed me where to go.  He and I ran the entire rest of the race together, and the company was super nice.  We were moving at about the same pace, and having a little bit of conversation and navigational consulting was really really helpful.  



We hit the aid station again at mile 37.  Y'all, they had pierogis.  Hot, delicious, wonderful, magical portable potato pockets.  I had four.  Then we ran the lollipop bit, and I grabbed a couple more pierogis for the road at mile 40.  At this point, we were probably running half and walking about half.  I started getting blisters around mile 38, probably from the wet socks, and the blisters were consistently the limiting factor from there on out, rather than my fitness.  



By the watch, the race ended up being 53 miles.  I got exceedingly grouchy in the last 2 miles, because I was mentally prepared for 51.5-52 miles, but not for 53.  But we finished!  My running buddy was encouraging me and pulling me along for the last few miles, which I really appreciated.  I might have given up on making the cutoff without him.  



\### Post-race

I crossed the finish line, heard tons of people cheering, and then collapsed onto a bench at a picnic table.  I caught up with all the people I'd chatted with during the race to see how they'd all done.  All of them finished!!  Including two guys doing their first ultra.  Seemed like most people had a really good night, despite the rough conditions.  I ate a couple of pancakes, and my husband picked me up from the finish area.  



He took me back to the hotel he'd stayed at so that I could shower.  Guys, I don't remember the last time a shower felt that good.  I smelled like wet feet at the end of the race, and cleaning off all the mud/sweat/bugspray felt amazing.  I made him stop at Chipotle so that I could get a 10:30am burrito, then I napped on the way home.  I napped for another couple of hours once we got home, and felt surprisingly okay afterward!  



The only serious physical consequence is that my blisters alone should really qualify me for short-term disability.  I have 12 of them, mostly big ones.  One on the bottom of each toe, and one on each heel.  I have one on each foot that goes between my big toe and the next toe, so right where flip flops sit.  I intend to whine about them extensively until they heal, because whining about minor self-inflicted injuries always makes them heal faster.



Otherwise, I'm feeling great!  I'm burning some sick leave today so that I don't have to go to work, but now I can stalk ultrasignup to find my next race :)

1lc1393,Dehydration… what am I getting wrong?,"I started running last year and this is my first year of entering races.

Every race I’ve run bar one (which weirdly enough was my longest, a half marathon) I have felt seriously dehydrated afterwards. I’m talking headache, nausea, upset stomach, sometimes chills, general shittiness.

I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong; I drink a lot of water throughout the day usually, minimum of 2L a day, and I make sure to drink before/during the race, including with electrolytes. After the race today, I drank 1.5L in the car alone, and then water at home, before the headache kicked in.

I think it’s also important to say that I sweat A LOT. I always have done - I just get SO hot. Like sometimes I feel like my head is gonna pop with the heat, and it’s the heat I struggle with before anything else when I’m running.

I really don’t want to have to stop races because I love them, but this is getting really difficult to deal with and it ruins the experience for me. Any advice will be appreciated!",1749996218.0,87,83,running,fitness

1la00lu,Entering races as a trans woman,"I’m hoping for a mature, positive discussion on this, although I know it will be controversial for some. I looked through old threads about the topic, but most discussions were based on outdated rules/policies as well as a completely different political environment.

Age: 50-55
Gender: F (born male)
Pace, etc.: see below

I’m transgender (male to female), and although I’ve been running for almost 4 decades I’ve only recently run in my first 5k. It was a Pride race, so being trans was a non factor.

But now I want to enter more races, and I don’t want to stir the pot or cause any controversy. Most runners I know are very inclusive and welcoming, but I know there are exceptions. Entering a race as a “man” when I’m absolutely not would be traumatic enough that I would likely not run at all. So, do I enter as my correct gender and hope it doesn’t become a big deal? Do I contact the race organizers each time? (a very uncomfortable conversation when I just want to run) Some considerations:

-I do not “pass” very well at this point. If someone looks at me closely they can generally tell I’m trans.

-I have been transitioning for 2.5 years. My hormones have been in the correct range for a significant time, and my testosterone levels are actually lower than cisgender women.

-I am not an elite runner by any stretch. My 10k PR is ~58 minutes and my 5k just under 27. The one half marathon I ran (by myself, not in a race) was over 3 hours.

-I won’t be entering any races where I might win any monetary or other tangible awards, so I wouldn’t be “taking” anything from cisgender runners.

I’m open to hearing conflicting opinions, but hopefully this can be civil.",1749767682.0,353,577,running,fitness

My circular route around my house is very hilly and so my pace varies wildly in line with the undulations (04:45-11:00min/km).

My question is, how do I incorporate tempo and interval runs when the terrain (i.e. tree roots to trip up on), and elevation gain/loss, dictate my speed.

My nearest track is a 45 minute drive away and there isn't really anywhere flat to try out speed work within walking distance.

I presume others have a similar issue, so how do you adapt your routine? Or have I just missed a key bit of reading?

1l86dr6,What helped you become consistent with strength training and stretching?,"I feel like it is a common joke among runners about how much we hate taking the time to do strength training or stretching. Personally, I have had so many false starts - I tell myself, ""this is the week"" and I maybe get through a half-hearted session or two, but then I just completely lose interest. It's so boring. It's so repetitive. And running is SO MUCH MORE FUN!

And yet... I'm constantly getting annoying injuries. One months it's ITBS. The next it's PFPS. Next my hip starts hurting out of nowhere. I've managed to adjust my running and still complete a couple marathons over the last year, but these injuries are such a drag.

So I'm curious to hear - if you're someone who used to hate strength and stretching, but it's now a regular part of your routine, how'd you do it?! What changed? What enables you to be consistent? Was it finding the right plan (and please feel free to drop your plan in the comments!)? Was it seeing results? Was it something else?

### Background
When I wrote [my last half marathon race report](https://np.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1d2i8ub/calgary_half_marathon_a_flawless_training_block_a/), I decided that a full marathon wasn’t on the cards for me. I didn’t have the time or energy to commit to that level of training, and shorter distances seemed like the more practical path.

So this year, I set my sights on the 10K at the Calgary Marathon. My primary goal was to break 50 minutes. My stretch goal was a seemingly impossible sub-48:00; a time that felt a little out of reach. To put my fitness in context at the start of this block: my personal bests were 4:21 for a kilometre, 7:45 for a mile (4:49/km pace), 24:49 for 5K, and 52:50 for 10K. The idea of holding something close to my fastest mile pace for 10 kilometres felt borderline delusional. But if I pulled it off, I’d be running at a pace I once thought was pure fantasy. And if I blew up? It would still make for one hell of a story.

Life being what it is, family commitments meant I couldn’t actually race at the event, but I decided to go through a full training block and time trial it anyway.

### Training
I used the new Garmin Run Coach for this training block. I had already spent about three months training under Garmin’s Daily Suggested Workouts (without a race goal) and felt that I had built enough of a base to handle a more aggressive program.

My weekly mileage was modest—the average hovered around a 30 km, with my peak week hitting only 45. On paper, this looks a little light, but it was quite demanding in practice. I was running five times a week: two easy runs, a long run, and two quality sessions (a rotation of tempo, threshold, VO2 Max, anaerobic, and sprint workouts). The overarching theme was low mileage, high intensity. Fortunately, with decent sleep and solid nutrition, I was able to handle the grind without falling apart.

That said, Garmin’s Run Coach is a little quirky. The 15-week program was divided into Base, Build, Peak, and Taper phases — but instead of building progressively, my training load would drop at the start of each new phase before climbing again. It made for some head-scratching moments. For instance, my highest 7-day average load actually occurred at the end of the Base phase.

I did catch a couple of colds and missed about a week of training twice, but even factoring that in, my training load felt suspiciously low for the goals I was chasing.

### Time Trial
When race day (or more accurately, _time trial day_) arrived, my confidence was not exactly overflowing. I debated between two options: either aim for a ""safe"" sub-50, or go for broke with the sub-48 attempt. Naturally, I picked the reckless one. ""Nothing ventured, nothing gained,"" I said to myself, knowing full well it could end in a spectacular blow-up.

I had picked a flat, fast route (the pathway along the Bow River) to give myself the best shot. The temperature was crisp 4°C, and a helpful tailwind was an unexpected stroke of luck. I aimed for a slight positive split: start at 4:42/km, finish at 4:50/km, hanging on for dear life in the later stages.

After a short warm-up, I took off. And immediately found myself at 4:35 pace. Rookie move! It took considerable discipline to rein it back. I knew from experience that the first few kilometres always feel suspiciously easy, but there’s hell to pay on the way back.

The first 5 km unfolded exactly as planned. Steady pace, controlled effort. My original plan was to turn back at this point and head back to the start. Half a kilometre into the return trip, the breeze that was a tailwind earlier had turned into an bothersome headwind (_Shocker, I know!_). So I turned back again, and decided to take an Uber back to my car after finishing.

This is where things began to unravel. Fatigue hit, I started to run out of breath, and I had to take brief walk breaks nearly every kilometre. The stopping and starting slowed me down. I was a few seconds ahead at the halfway point  but started hemorrhaging seconds after 6 km. Kilometres 7 and 8 were absolute misery. A 30-second walk break at the 7 km mark pretty much torpedoed any shot at breaking 48 minutes. Thankfully, sub-49 was still within reach.

I summoned whatever scraps of resolve I had left, pushed through to the finish, and crossed 10K in 48:30 … half a minute shy of my stretch goal.

### Assessment
Did I nail sub-48? No. Was I thrilled? Absolutely.

At the start of the year, breaking 50 minutes felt wildly optimistic. Running 48:30 -- and hitting PBs of 7:29 for the mile and 23:37 for 5K along the way -- made this a huge personal win.

Once the high wore off, I started dissecting what I could’ve done better. The most obvious area was my training. The low mileage remained a consistent concern throughout the cycle, and I’m fairly certain that adding more volume would’ve helped me claw back those 30 seconds.

Next, I turned to the race itself. Could I have paced it better? Maybe started a little slower and gone for a negative split? It’s a tactic that has worked for me in a half marathon, but a 10K is a different beast. The intensity is higher, and it’s less forgiving of mistakes.

Lastly, I wondered if I could’ve just toughed it out -- pushed through the pain, skipped the walk breaks, and hung onto my goal pace. It’s an easy thing to imagine in hindsight, but in the moment, it would’ve been nearly impossible. The fact that I was forced to walk, not because my legs gave out, but because I was gasping for air, told me I was already operating close to my limit.

The more I thought about it though, the more I realized how many things _had_ gone my way that day. First, I had the luxury of choosing a nice, flat course, and revising it halfway through: not at all possible in a sanctioned race. Certainly not in Calgary, where the organizers love tossing in a few hills. I also ran exactly 10 kilometers as measured by my watch. In an official race, you always end up covering a little extra distance, and those final few hundred meters eat up valuable seconds. The weather too, was close to ideal: cold, with a helpful tailwind. And, for the first time, I was wearing supershoes (Endorphin Speed 4’s). Had I run the Calgary Marathon 10K in my regular trainers, I doubt I would have gone under 49 minutes.

### Closing Thoughts
The most meaningful takeaway has been realising how far I’ve come. [Just two years ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/running/comments/13v8fhw/race_report_2023_calgary_marathon_10k/), the idea of running a 10K in under 55 minutes felt daunting. I remember looking at those numbers and thinking, ""_how do people even do that""_? And now, here I am---finishing six minutes faster!

And it’s not just my race times that have improved; I have become much fitter as well. My VO2 Max has climbed from 46 to 51. My easy run pace, which used to hover around 7:30/km to 8:00/km, now sits between 6:15 and 6:30/km. I’m leaner, stronger, and just generally in a better place than I ever was.

In the end, while there’s always room to improve -- more mileage, smarter pacing, tougher mental game -- it feels like several stars aligned for me that day. And honestly, given where I started, this was probably the best result I could’ve hoped for.
