1qak271,GKI Level After Eating,"Is this a good level to be at after a full day of eating? 

BG 112mg/dL Ketones 1.4mmol/L = GKI 4.7.

This morning before I ate, I didn’t get to test, but this was my afternoon level after eating lunch: 

BG 84mg/dL Ketones 1.6mmol/L = GKI 2.9.

I test my GKI twice a day sometimes (probably too often), but it’s been 11 days of being strictly keto and I haven’t seen much in terms of beneficial results. I am 5 pounds lighter but my weight normally fluctuates that much in any given week anyway. I also have a new skin rash and my body is having hormonal changes that I personally perceive as negative. So I know I’m definitely making an impact, just not the impact I was looking for. 

My starting weight was 175lb, I am currently 170. I’m 5’5, female. 25 years old.

Left: me this morning at 144.9.

2 months since exercising, currently working on dropping back down to 140 from 150.

Right: 140 lbs lifting 5 to 6 days a week.

I started working out again last Sunday. I burned myself out by just sticking to lifting. This week I just did what I felt like doing. Lifted when I felt like it, cardio when I didn't want to lift.

I first started with an hour walk. I used the treadmill on a cold day, realized pretty quickly, I can't jog for long. Hit the treadmill 3 times this week. Jogged 3 miles without having to stop in 35 minutes or so. I even finished off the last 5 minutes of the hour jogging.

I've decided to lift 4 times a week mixing some kind of ab exercises in there so I don't burn myself out again. Jogging 2 times a week to break up the lifting. 

Wish me luck 🙂

1qafdeg,Struggling to restart,"6 years ago just before COVID started I heard about keto. And got really into it. Literally became my way of life for a couple of years and I changed so many bad habits.
It was the best I felt and I lost close to 20kg. Then one day the carbs crept back in and I managed to keep about majority of the weight off. I had a child in 2023 and went back to 100% eating everything and not worrying. I was breastfeeding so of course barely put any weight on. 
Now I’m currently at my heaviest I’ve ever been. Having a child has played havoc with my mental health so badly.  
I need to lose the weight but for some reason keep self sabotaging myself. I’ll do well for a couple of days and then go right back to eating crap. 
My husbands 100% supportive if I go back on keto as he saw how much I benefited from it. 
I know what I have to do but it seems getting myself to do it is a massive struggle.

How do I get back into that mindset? 😩


EDIT:
Wow this group is so supportive! I even rewatched a documentary during my daughter’s nap time. Fat Fiction which reopened my eyes again! I’m feeling more motivated. I know I won’t be perfect, I’ll have slip ups but I want to make this change again. I want to feel good, I want my clothes to fit me comfortably! ",1768175968.0,26,28,keto,diet

1qacxgo,help me with this,"shory story. I tried carnivore a few times. I do a few days, actually lose 2-4 kilos fast and then from the craving I go and binge on processed food, hot dogs, shawarma, sweet stuff like this. A few days, all the weight is back plus some more. I want to transition rather than go full in as Im not resilient enough. For carbs I can do either fruits or raw milk, Ive got access to 2 great sources so the milk its not a problem

Would the fruits or the milk be better source of carb till I trainsition or both. How many carbs should I go 30, 50, 100, more, less? or just do daily when cravings come. or maybe daily when cravings are really bad. I could even try instead of daily to wait till I cant resist so a few days and then instead of junk just eat fruit. what do you say. I want to eventually go full carnivore as I got to lose big weight about 45 kg. I become somewhat a recluse from the shame of becoming obese over a relatively short period of time, I dont even want to go outside. its a tragedy how much Ive let myself go. I do need advice

Also tho least important question, I do not understand what being in keto actually does, like if you go 10 carbs a day surely you are in keto so you say you burn fat effeciantely, but even if you go 300 carbs a day you will lose fat if you are in a deficit, so what does it mean to actually be in keto. is it just the hunger supression of having no carbs.",1768169936.0,3,3,keto,diet
1qacg8t,What extra flavor to add to this carnivore burger thngie?,"It's a pound of hamburger, cooked to crumbles. Put in baking dish and pour over mix of 6 eggs, 1/2 cup heavy cream, and 1 cup grated/shredded Parmesan cheese, and salt to taste (which means I forgot to add salt until once I was eating it).

In and of itself, it was okay. Added salt and even extra cheese when I was eating it. But it still overall tasted mostly like hamburger. 

Not to be dissuaded, I'm currently making a double batch and adding extra parm. I've thought perhaps I should fry up some onions in the beef fat and add that. And I know the cheese is rather mild tasting. It freezes well and nukes well.

With this basic recipe (my next try will have extra sharp cheddar and maybe some bacon), what flavor addition would make it more full-bodied?",1768168818.0,5,33,keto,diet

It will be 2 years since I started this plan and I wanted to post an update for those who, like me, get discouraged when you don't get big results quickly like some do. 

First, I am (almost) 57 yo female, postemopausal. I've been doing IF and low carb since Jan. 31, 2024. Many days are true keto, some days are not. I have not yet started exercising and have a sedentary job. 

As of today, I have lost 75 lbs. exactly. My A1c is down to 5.5. I am off blood pressure meds. My cholesterol med is reduced to the lowest dose. 

The 2 years have gone quickly, but when I first started, I thought I'd never get here. 

I am a little over halfway to ly goal, but now believe I'll succeed.

8 weeks into successful keto, lost 25 lbs (195 to 180) 6ft 1"" 56 male.   

For the last 5 weeks I've been focused on protein pulses, with enough fat but still caloric deficit.  Been tracking ketones with meter.

I play soccer and previous to keto had a lot of aches and pains.  These aches I felt in my joints making walking without grimacing hard after playing and into the next day.  I'll call these ""legacy "" aches because keto made them go away for the most part.  Felt miraculous.

Another type of ache I have had in the past were ""workout "" aches , maybe delayed onset muscle soreness.   Let's say I did three sets of squats after a week off.  I'd feel soreness in big muscle groups of legs The next day or two   But these were the ""good"" kind of ache, the kind that reminded me that I exercised well, and these wouldn't impede me like the ""legacy "" aches.

Well in the last couple of weeks, I have experienced a new type of ache.  It's in the muscle, typically quads.   It makes me feel restless.   At night I'll try to ""kick"" my legs to subdue the pain.  

I'm playing more soccer - up to three days a week sometimes three days in a row.  I don't notice a correlation between that intensity and these aches.  

I take 400mg of mag glyc and mag mal, potassium citrate. My sodium intake I'm beginning to suspect.  I put a lot on foods, but have not been hitting 2 tsp of table salt.

1q9wdlj,Feedback on my meal plan.,"Morning all. I'm starting keto in February and would like some rough feedback on a meal plan.

Just some prerequisites:

I don't eat salad / raw veg (with very few exceptions). Most of my veg I oven roast in avocado oil with salt and pepper.

I really dislike condiments, so stuff like mayo, salad dressing etc wont work for me. I'm not even a huge fan of butter, though I do eat it from time to time.

Veg I usually eat:

* Broccoli
* Cauliflower
* Green beans
* Mushrooms
* Brussel sprouts
* Tomato (usually if I'm making some sort of sauce)
* Courgette
* Cucumber
* Chives, watercress, rocket, lettuce, spinach

Meat wise I usually eat pork and chicken breast during the week, and on weekends have either beef, ostrich or venison. I also have a ready supply of Biltong. I also usually eat cheese, eggs and peanuts.

Fish I eat tinned tuna or sardines.

I do drink a fair bit of coffee, usually with a splash of whole fat milk. I would ideally like to keep to that if possible. I'm not a huge fan of cream and really dislike milk alternatives.

Lastly I intermittent fast from 12pm until 8pm, and usually get hungry around 1pm.

I'll likely just eat egg, cheese, Biltong and maybe some fish for lunch from Mon - Friday as I generally don't eat a lot in the day.

Dinner wise I'm planning to eat pork or chicken from Sunday - Thursday, then having burgers / steaks of one of the more exotic meats on Friday and Saturday. All of this will be done with a tray of the above mentioned veg in various quantities.

Some days I don't feel like roasting I'll do something like a casserole with everything in it.

I know this is super basic, but I usually don't put much thought into my meals, I like doing something that's mainly set it and forget it.

If there's anything I could potentially add or something I'm clearly missing from my rotation please do let me know. I'd like to go into this as properly as possible.

I also drink a reasonable amount of water (1-1.5l daily).",1768128260.0,3,8,keto,diet

I posted here years ago when I was 18, keto did wonders for me then, brought me down to the lowest weight I had ever been (around 207lbs), plus the energy and the appetite stabilization helped significantly with my ADHD and with CICO.

Of course, life happened, and eventually years later I hopped on the scale and saw a terrifying 345, I carry my weight pretty well, and I knew I was much larger than I had been, but that number made me want to puke. 

After a lot of feeling bad about myself, I tried calorie counting, visited a weight loss doctor who advised broad life style changes, had good and bad days, but the lifestyle changes I made had good effects and I lost maybe 15 pounds in half a year. This also netted me the benefit of accepting my body, and continuing the journey mostly for health reasons, and not the judgement of others.

Keto though, has finally pushed me down to 299 today! The lightest I have been in years, the diet does wonders.I also have started exercising again and doing my prereqs for nursing school (we'll see how my nutrition teacher feels about it lol). When I log my calories for the day, I actually have to *tell* myself to eat more, because I stop being hungry at 1000 calories! Something that I forgot was even possible 

It's always a pleasure to browse this subreddit and see everyone's success stories, and I'm happy to share mine! I'm very excited to talk to the doctor again, and hope I can post when I reach my my goal weight!

1q9kxv0,People don't Understand Keto,I have lost over 67 lbs since May and I'm going to 100 lbs. One thing people from the outside looking in don't understand about keto is its an all or nothing diet. You cant just get pizza one day and go about your business. It resets your diet and you have to start over. My family and friends dont understand that. When I tell them im on keto they look at me like oh you should just get on a calorie deficit and still eat what you want. They act like getting on a diet is something so simple yet its not. A calorie deficit never worked for me as I lost only 2 lbs a month when I tried that as opposed to keto where I have lost significantly more. Why do people treat keto like its just some fad diet?,1768092209.0,385,188,keto,diet
1q9ge7y,1 week on keto in body scan results,"Hi!

  
I'm sure many people are curious about this as we know water weight gets shed in the beginning. I lost 5.4 lbs (starting weight 150) with skeletal muscle mass at 56.9 lbs and body fat percentage at 31.8% and ECW at .372.

1 week later SMM is 54.5 lbs and body fat percentage is 32.3 but ECW is .370!

(Not a doctor, nutritionist, or personal trainer so don't take any of this as bible)

  
For anyone not too familiar with these, this is all good for Keto. Glycogen storage can be read as muscle mass and dropping 2 lbs of muscle in one week would be insane, so the scan is likely picking up on that change. The BF % increase is due to not have lost much fat yet but shedding a lot in water weight. And the ECW drop can indicate that water retention drop or possibly some loss of inflammation. 

  
So anyways, if you're curious there's my results. I stayed strict under 20 g net carbs a day. I know that now the initial water shed and adjustment is done I'll be moving into solid fat burning zone. Happy to update further if anyone is interested as I go. ",1768080850.0,5,0,keto,diet
1q9gb78,Strange effect on my vision?,"I had a retinal fold with psuedomembrane formation.  Required retinal surgery 5 yrs ago.  Then had to have cataract done in the same eye.
So after the surgery the doc said they really don't know how much sight will be regained.  It was slow but I regained sight in my eye except vision in that eye was just blurry.  Lost depth perception and had a bunch of falls but im used to that now and Im more careful on stairs or uneven terrain.
The blurry vision really hindered my ability to drive and I got in 4 accidents.  2 were in my own driveway!
Anyway I've been on keto about 4 or 5 months and I noticed my vision in the eye is much clearer!
I think it's due to the keto lifestyle and must have been related to some degree of inflammation the doc couldn't see.
Just to back up at my 8 months follow up he told me that there would be no further progress.  I'd just have to live with blurred vision.

I have been prediabetic for the past couple of years. I tried several approaches but could not reverse it, and it seemed to be progressing toward diabetes. Recently, I also developed mild fatty liver. I started a **ketogenic diet (carb<30 g/day)**, **calorie deficit (<1200 kcal/day)**, and **intermittent fasting (18:6) simultaneously**. I have been following this for about a month.

My glucose level is now \~5.0 mmol/L (it was \~6.5 mmol/L for about a year). I have lost \~10 lb. It is still too early to draw conclusions about my liver condition.

**My questions are:** Is that really it? was it actually this simple? is this improvement permanent of temporary? how long should or can I continue this approach? I am somewhat concerned because I am consuming very limited fruits and vegetables and do not feel I am getting enough energy. To be safe, I am mostly relying on multivitamins. What are my options here? I want a permanent solution that I can maintain for a healthy life.

1q8ub0k,How often do you actually add extra fats to meals?,"I've done keto a number of times before, and always had success with it. This time, feeling much more experienced and not needing to track every calorie and macro anymore, decided to get back on keto for a much longer term thing.

In the past, I've most likely not had quite enough fat, and a bit too much protein. So I've made it a point to add extra fats to my food after cooking. Mainly adding olive oil on top of whatever meal I've made for myself. After doing this for a few months, I finally weighed myself and found out that I actually GAINED a few pounds. 

Throughout these few months, I've actually been tracking my ketones with a blood monitor occasionally, and I HAVE been in ketosis the entire time it seems like. I'm quite active, and although I still eat a good amount, I'm not overeating by any abnormal amount.

The only conclusion I can come to, is that adding the extra fats to my foods has added way more calories than I thought, and it's caused me to still be putting on extra weight slowly.

It’s a narrative review so it’s pretty readable, free and most importantly to me seems very reasonable in its approach: basically it accepts a lot of the general benefits of keto and focuses on specific medical reasons why (as the title says) keto may not be for everyone. It also clearly acknowledges what isn’t known, and for most conditions is careful to distinguish between keto being a bad idea and being cautious.

Lo and behold, I was soon wide awake. And up until 3 am! I now notice that when I drink coffee, I get perked up. It works!

1q77mew,Early keto hunger is louder than I expected,"Ok, real talk: everyone warned me about the “keto flu,” but nobody really prepared me for how weird the hunger can feel in early keto. It’s not always normal stomach hunger. Sometimes it feels like a restless, edgy “I need something” feeling, even after I just ate a decent meal.

I think part of it is that my body isn’t fully efficient at using fat yet. Carbs are lower, glycogen is dropping, and my brain is still learning to run on ketones. So when energy dips, my appetite shows up like an alarm system. I also realized I was under-salting everything. Once I added electrolytes, the cravings calmed down a bit, which shocked me.

Right now I’m trying to be smart: I’m not forcing low calories, I’m prioritizing protein, and I’m adding enough fat to stay full, but not turning it into an all-day snack fest. If you remember the early stage, how long did the hunger roller coaster last for you? Any specific meals or routines that made it easier?",1767865310.0,41,64,keto,diet

Hormones?,"I’ve been noticing a weird pattern: I’ll feel solid during the day, eating keto, feeling steady, then overnight or early morning it’s like my body hits a different setting. I wake up hungrier than expected, sometimes a little wired and it feels like my ketones are lower in the morning even if my dinner was totally keto.

From what I’m reading, hormones might be involved. Like cortisol rising in the early morning, the body making extra glucose to help you wake up and that temporarily pushing ketones down. It makes sense in theory.. but it’s still frustrating when you’re trying to stay consistent and you wake up feeling like you “lost progress” while you were asleep.

I’m not looking for perfection, I just want to understand what’s normal. If you’ve dealt with this, did anything help? Earlier dinner? Less late-night snacking? More electrolytes? Better sleep?

I keep seeing people say “just keep carbs low and you’ll be fine,” but it’s been more like I’m bouncing in and out depending on sleep, stress, and even workouts.

What’s confusing is that I’m not doing anything wild. Mostly whole foods, no huge “keto desserts,” and my carbs are pretty low. But if I do a harder training day, or I eat later than usual, I feel like my body flips into “need quick fuel” mode. Then I’m craving salty stuff, and sometimes something sweet, which I wasn’t expecting.

I’m trying to treat this as an adaptation phase, not a failure. I’m focusing on consistent meals, enough protein, and not under-eating. But I’d love to hear from people who’ve been through this.

That is the past though. I’ve lost 30 pounds so far and have 50 to go. I lost the 30 through eating a balanced diet of clean foods, but I stalled. So I started eating keto (with IF) again last week.

Life is overwhelming for a lot of us these days and that only threw my mental health more all over the place until out of a desperate last attempt, i said ""screw it"" and jumped back on keto after 5 years.

Once I am fully use to this way of living again, I am considering talking to my gp about tapering off some of my meds or at least reducing the amount.

History of ED and past failed attempt.,"So back in 2019 I tried going keto for a few months and didn’t have great success on it due to me having gallbladder issues that later resulted in a cholecystectomy. I also, for some reason, felt like I never fully got adjusted to the diet, even after two months of trying it seriously. I was exhausted and starving, constantly thinking about carbs, which inevitably led to me binging on them. I have a history of binge eating disorder which gets worsened when I restrict my diet.

I feel like no matter what I do I’m always still in pain and nothing is helping. I am really desperate at this point and I’ve read a lot of antidotal experiences from people who suffer with fibromyalgia that going on a Ketogenic diet has significantly helped them manage their pain and symptoms. I am honestly willing to try anything to just get my life back. I’m only 27 and I can’t imagine myself living the rest of my life like this. I seriously don’t know if I could keep living if things don’t improve soon.

I used the original recipe - it appears there are some updated versions that do not use egg whites, but I have not graduated to that

also, did the total rookie mistake of not leaving the oven closed for the ""cool down, do not fall"" part so it was a little odd.

my thinking is the recipe would really lend itself to the eggnog rolls, pretzels and chocolate over the standard bread option.

has anyone else tried this?  it does seem as if so much still is better if it is made at home - so few keto friendly foods that truly are.  (like I am going to waste 11 carbs on on slice of bread? ah, no).

EDIT

as per the request here are links to some of the recipes.  please read u/novel_mouse_5654 's comment as she mentions how important the resting option is to keep the bread from bricking There are a few more out there, and she has updated to only use egg white powder for the bread.

1q448rl,Xylitol causing me some issues,"Just putting this out there as a potential danger for anyone that consumes a lot of xylitol. I got my bloodwork done recently and everything came back fine except my LDL was a bit high. My main take away though was the phlebotomist mentioned how it was really difficult to draw my blood and asked me if I hydrated beforehand. I drank a lot of water so I was a bit concerned. 

I had also recently developed a clotted hemorrhoid that is taking a while to go away. As well as noticing some heaviness in my legs and shortness of breath indicating circulation issues. So I started analyzing my diet and through some research found out that high intake of xylitol can potentially lead to increased blood clotting. 

I had been popping xylitol mints throughout the day because I've been struggling with dental issues and xylitol can help with that. I think I was incidentally increasing my blood clotting with that high dose xylitol so I've stopped that for now to see what happens. 

I know people here will use a lot of sugar substitutes so it might be something to consider if you consume a lot of xylitol and are having clotting/blood thickness issues.

I am starting up keto and I wanted to run my plan by the subject matter experts to see if there were any fine tuning suggestions or blantant issues that need to be adjusted. 

Nutrition is 16:8 fast with a macro split of 60 (fat), 30% (protein - 170g), and 10% (Carbs...realistically under 30 net).

Routine starts with a minimum 30 minute treadmill walk immediately after waking up at 5 am. I work a desk job for 8-9 Hours and plan on doing resistance training in the evening after work.

Resistance training will alternate days between full body large muscle groups and full body smaller muscle groups.

I began my journey on December 15th, starting at 175lb as a 21yr female, and I was feeling quite down on myself and suffering from constant cravings and also simply coping with food when I was sad and like a treat when I was happy. Felt like a never ending cycle. 

It has been less than a full month and I have lost 10lb so far! I’ve done this by staying under 20 net carbs everyday. The best part though, is I don’t bored eat or cope eat anymore because it feels like all the food noise has faded.

I still enjoy some of my favorite meals and simply change the ingredients to be keto friendly. I’ve lost weight in the past (50lbs) a few years ago but it was done in an unstructured and unhealthy way so I never maintained it. This diet has provided me the structure I’ve been seeking so desperately and the results so far have been beyond encouraging.

I only plan to pursue this diet for about 6 months as I’ve heard that’s the most ideal time frame and plan to maintain a low carb lifestyle moving forward. 

I don’t have many people to talk to about my excitement and joy for this journey I’m on with keto now so I am grateful this community exists. I hope everyone who is also on this journey stays strong and keeps reaping the amazing benefits of keto :3 ",1767463041.0,39,30,keto,diet
1q30mrg,Returning to Keto after a few months.,"I was diagnosed with mono late last year and it was advised to not do keto during that time due to elevated liver enzymes. I have since recovered, and returned to keto.

In the time that I returned to eating a carbohydrate-based diet, despite eating a very healthy version of said diet, I felt horrible. I ate high fiber meals like oatmeal with nut butter, consistently ate enough carbs to give me energy, got in plenty of fiber. Despite the carbs supplying me with energy, having to eat every 4 hours to have said energy was something I had not experienced long-term in years. 

Since returning to keto, I can literally eat breakfast and dinner, skipping lunch, and having stable energy throughout. I acknowledge that carbs aren’t the devil and for the average person, keto might not be for them. However, keto is what works for me and being able to eat this way again is extremely beneficial for me as I am very well fat-adapted. ",1767461694.0,14,18,keto,diet
1q2yjvs,Keto headache/irritated after year,"Dear fellow ketodieters,  
  
Im following a ketodiet for around a year now. The last month I notice something that I could be some kind of adverse reaction. Around eleven in the morning I feel agitated, can't concentrate well anymore and get a headache. Maybe you know what the problem could be?  
In mornings at seven am I eat three full spoons of whipped whipping cream (sometimes with some yoghurt) with some cacao, protein powder and blue fruits.   
Then around one I eat nuts or avocado or leftover or coconut milk.   
Then in the evening around six I eat meat with vegetables.   
As supplements I take methylfolate, magnesium and a bit of cod liver.   
I don't have health issues.

1q2ua3w,"Help me understand Cronometer's macro targets for rigid keto, is this enough protein?","I've been on a low carb diet since September and have decided to up my game and switch to ""rigid"" keto using Cronometer's parameters.  

My stats: 

Age:  54

Weight:  250

Height: 5'8

Activity Level :  Light exercising

Here is what the app recommends I eat per day on rigid keto:

Protein: 53 grams

Net Carbs: 20 grams

Fat:  178 grams

Total Calories:  1896

My concern is that I don't think the protein is high enough for my age, weight and height.  I entered in my stats in another keto website and it's recommending 139 grams of protein a day.   

I have double checked to make sure all my information is accurate in the Cronometer app.

1q2tpfe,"Trying to stay under 20g total carbs, need snacks that I can ""pick at"" while typing, that don't get my fingers too slimy and don't need a fork or spoon to eat?","What it says in the title. I am finding that net carbs just aren't working for me; before the holiday I managed to get under 20 total carbs and lost 5 pounds, but during the holidays I slipped back into using net carbs and gained, so my New Years readjustment is to go back to the total carbs. But I also ""type a lot"" and am looking for foods to eat that are easy to eat ""while typing."" Over the holidays I unfortunately got hooked on Quest's version of Reese's Pieces and need to break myself from eating those \[If I eat 2 packs of those in one day that is 6 net carbs\], I find the best way to quit one junky food is to substitute it with something else, but it has to be something easy to limit, so to begin with, a small bowl of nuts are not that \[I actually can't control those at all\]. But any other suggestions would be considered.

Update: Trying to make it clear that I don't eat between meals, when I say snack, I am trying to get closure to an actual meal in a ""dessert"" type format, only have it be healthy. I don't eat between meals and I am not ""mindlessly snacking."" I eat my meals in front of the computer. I have ADHD, and need to do two things at the same time to keep my mind from getting bored.

1q2i79d,Get back on track or fast?,"Hey everyone, and Happy New year! I’ve been at this are over a year, started 9/10/2024 after some very discouraging bloodwork, and obvious poor health habits. Started with a bout of depression that caused a serious fast (got help in that department thankfully) after the death of a best friend. Starting weight-345, height-6’6, zero exercise, and crap mental health. After my wife forced me to see a doctor, bloodwork came back brutal… A1C went from 5.9 to the 9s, with enough family history of diabetes, and all normal vitamin levels were low. The low vitamin D directed the doctors towards depression. After getting mental help I was still in a bad place health wise… I went zero sugar/bread for the A1C and noticed definite changes in mood and energy which caused me to go all out. From 9/10/24 to now I went from 345 to 200/190. I feel awesome, mental healths never been better, and overall health is good imo. I do pull-ups, dips, and pushups daily and walk a lot. The holidays really kicked my ass (stressful), been pretty strict diet wise and I don’t drink alcohol (clean 10 years). Reason I’m reaching out is, I’ve noticed a big change in my gut health. I’m able to connect how I use the bathroom to how good my diet is. I haven’t went off course, but I can see a difference. My question is, would a fast help me reset?

About me - 
5’2” Asian female in late 30s.

I finally got into ketosis this year and have stayed there for over five months now.

The weight just melted off during this time, so I reached my goal of losing 20 pounds, then I just let my body keep losing another five pounds (I am female, 5'5"", small/medium frame, 125 pounds now...started at 150, highest ever, was 170).

Now, though, I am noticing a psychological effect of how my clothes are fitting.

I used to wear solely baggy, loose fitting clothes...most likely, my way of ""hiding"" my body...now, I have had to buy some new clothes about two sizes smaller...but I can't get used to my clothes feeling ""snug"" on my body now...it feels ""tight"" but it isn't really.

Funny how we get used to things being one way for soooo long (35 years, for me), that it is startling, and a little scary, when it changes so drastically, so quickly...it was like my psyche wasn't ready for this quick change.

Well, of course I love how I feel now, but I am still adjusting to the ""fit"" of my clothes!  Lol

Reading what people were saying on this sub I didn't believe much of it regarding it not being bad for cholesterol.

Here are my before and after numbers, 120 days on keto.

Cholesterol 264 down to 225 , 200 is listed as normal for age 

triglycerides 134 down to 56 , 100 is listed as normal for age 

HDL 73 to 117, 39 is listed as normal for age 

LDL 164 to 94, 100 is listed as normal for age 

The blood pressure and lipid panel corrected better than pharmaceuticals would have. I've never taken medications for either, but was about to start. I've watched others and it took them a year to get under control, then side effects like being light headed and the unpleasantries of statins.

I would like to come off keto, despite not craving most of things I gave up. Have probably been saving money by not doing much in the way of restaurants, and sort of miss that. I've lost more weight than I wanted to. I find it difficult to eat enough to maintain weight. My exercise definitely is down, need to work on it. I'm giving up gym membership for the month as it will be too crowded until people drop their resolutions, dog walking is most of what I'm doing every day.

I ate a lot of canned anchovies then, but I am not feeling those much this time. Honestly, that is my COMPLETE list. I was eating ""keto"" sandwiches, but those big brand breads always kick me out. Can someone help me make a MAN SIZED shopping list, that doesn't require hours of prep, or that relies on me eating what I've made within four days, due to refrigeration limits? And I live in a house where NOBODY does their dishes, so I (the head of household!) have to clean dishes everyday for my food prep. I get lazy too, I want to have lazy days where i dont get booted out of ketosis because I'm not up to a sink full of dishes on a workday. AND: I entered Keto the first time 72 fast. Is there another way I can ""lock in"" ketosis within my five days off? Too hard to start when working....",1767207921.0,11,36,keto,diet

not only did it taste OK, it tasted sweet. VERY sweet. checked, double checked and triple checked the ingredients, and couldn't find any evidence that there was any sugar or artificial sweetener in the ingredients. But none of my other cinnamon teas had this effect. so I started to wonder, is it the 'hot cinnamon' that's making it sweet? 

purchased some hot cinnamon flavoring online, once again triple checked the ingredients, and added it to some plain tea. it was so sweet! so anyway, I guess I have discovered (unless everyone already knew this but me lol) a new way to sweeten things that isn't artificial and isn't sugar either. have about four gallons of tea in my fridge now. goodbye diet coke!

1pyqzhj,Critique my keto induction month :-) low histamine approach,"hi all, I'm (34, M) kicking off the new year with a focused keto induction. It's not my first time doing keto—I’ve done it sporadically over the past ten years—but my last attempt triggered quite severe symptoms (rash, swelling). I’ve identified the likely cause and am now planning a low-histamine keto plan.

**Meal structure:** Two meals per day, focusing on simplicity and histamine safety.

**Protein/fat staples:**

* 750 g total 15% fat beef mince
* 3 whole eggs daily
* Low-histamine vegetables: zucchini, spinach
* MCT oil from coconut for energy and ketone support

**Electrolytes:**

* Lo Salt (sodium + potassium)
* Magnesium citrate 300 mg daily
* Multivitamin + vitamin D

**Optional supplementation:** Occasional whey protein with water or full-fat milk

**My goals & concerns:**

* Prevent keto flu through electrolyte management (just make up a water bottle and sip it through the day)
* Minimize histamine triggers that probably caused previous reactions (was eating sausages/bacon/cured meats and cheese daily last time)
* Keep meals simple, IBS-friendly, and nutrient-complete

**I’d love feedback on:**

* Low-histamine keto strategies I might be missing (potentially to mix up the protein and fat sources occasionally – there's a hog roast lunch place who offer a box of shredded pork with salad)
* Electrolyte approaches or tweaks to avoid fatigue, dizziness and cramps
* Meal ideas that fit this template while keeping histamine low

I've included my keto calculator results below, with fat mostly from the beef mince, plus a bit for the cooking oil I end up using (ghee/tallow) and occasional avocado.

Lost around 15 pounds / 7.5kg. 
Experienced very little cravings, not macro counting, but I'd say kept it under 30-50g carbs every day.
I feel kind of like I cracked the code for a healthy diet for me – it's about reducing stimulants in life.
I cannot give this up, though might need to relax the carbs a little going forward, and allow cheat days.
I am due to have bloods done in 3 weeks' time, am hoping LDL is not haywire.
Had people complimenting me on looking younger / leaner a lot more often than usual.
Couldn't have done it without: M&S chicken and beef stock; savoy cabbage; almond milk unsweetened; rooibos tea, steak, tinned fish, eggs for every breakfast, cheese and mayo.
Focus and concentration at work improved dramatically, being in meeting felt much easier.
Thinking through problems, easier.
Interacting with people socially, so much easier.
Less likely to perceive events badly for me, less anxiety generally.
A feeling of being more in control of how you perceive your circumstances
Completely eliminating snacking between meals – it's just a procrastination habit for me.
Zero caffeine or alcohol, I'd broken the back of these addictions previously. Found Drop Beer, a very low call beer. 
Only supplements were a few capsules a psyllium husks and a vitamin tablet every day or so.
 
Day 1 - bit of a headache as day before starting had been a bit heavy, with ice cream
 
Day 2 - snapped at daughter unnecessarily; less bloated; heavy dreams as woke 6am
 
d3 - trousers still too tight, work bag felt v heavy, good mood morning despite early wake, felt balanced in office life and an evening entertaining clients felt much easier than usual
 
d4 - bit of heartburn, early wake up again, noticeable more chilled out, in situations that would ordinarily apply stress. and just generally equilibrium is noticeable and welcome, even after big day
 
d5 - intense and easy concentration for 3 hours on boring technical work, despite not wanting to or
feeling should have to do it. Flicker of frustration at lunch as couldn’t try a beautiful Guinness beef pasty puff pie in cafe. Again, didn't
sleep well
 
d6 - stiff and fatigued on waking; focused at work morning; snoozed a bit over lunch; bit lethargic and inertia
stopping my afternoon productivity; stable mood; no real cravings yet
 
d7 - first Sat at home, harder to distract than working day, bit stiff in morning, ok mood
 
d8 - bit of a reflection point, think this is very good for my mental state and mood. Anxiety v low. Resisted
sweets at school fair easily. Sugar is connected to feeling crap about news media etc.
 
d9 - waking easier, bit of numbness ache in hands / fingers, mood good, stable and positive. no cravings,
no keto flu. anxiety could be higher due to work events approaching, but is pretty much zero
 
d10, it's no panacea to points of distinct stress at work, but still a great advantage to have in dealing
with them, compared to others I see around me grappling with ups and down, and reassuring to know tomorrow will feel the same
 
d11, conference and party, was solid and fine all day, only needed small breathers between events, even
after heavy work party which was followed by more client entertaining in the evening, and managed the logistics of those things, sparkling water helps a lot
 
d12, as approach end week 2, feeling good. waist hasn't shrunk really, trousers still v tight, which is my goal to loosen
 
d13, second Friday better with having found a good low cab beer (although had lots of them) and fried nuts. No cravings
whatsoever. Need meal shake up, diff things for this week. a feeling of accomplishment, people have been complimenting me, face thinner, look better over Teams and in person
 
d14, smooth sailing still, jeans feeling a bit slimmer finally. felt fine despite late sleeping. cooking a whole chicken, concerns about cholesterol
 
d15, snapped shouted at daughter over timing in morning dressing, made her cry, felt very bad. Socialised well with colleagues on train, generally less anxiety but need to watch if don't make a mealtime I can lose temper too easily at small things. A few times found myself out of house but unable to get a compliant meal urgently, which is more problematic than if not doing keto
 
d16/17 - feeling good, stable, in control, but experiencing some familiar lack of motivation / procrastination at work, but perhaps more to do with work being slow overall. not losing waistline, trousers tight still yet not bloated from food
 
d18, ate less for breakfast, and half for lunch, feeling fine and better not hungry or heavy tum. Think I’ve been eating too much on this diet, unnecessarily boosting volume of protein to feel full, thinking I'm compensating for lack of carbs.
 
d19, realisation that I've been eating a bit too much each meal, after reading about carnivore diet meal prep, in fact it's just a normal meal ditch the carbs - i.e. cos also needs calorie deficit to lose weight, still feel stable, waking up a tad heavy, waking no appetite, yesterday had light meals save for dinner, ground meat is always good and fast
 
d20, another fine Friday nite, naturally able to get up reason early feel fine, snappy at wife but that's other
causes, peaceful walking around park which ordinarily would have irritated me
 
d21, really feeling the mental benefits, feel so calm it's impossible to make myself have racing, imaginative thoughts, even when out for a walk where my mind used to disappear off into such things, same with nodding off at night, just not obsessive planning, lack of sugar must be calming that part of brain, even no irritation when meeting and have to speak with people I dislike, no ripple in the pond even or residual pent up angst
 
d22, ate goulash meat dish for lunch bit carby, the carbs set me in my worst spin so far, fatigued and tired eyes till bedtime, bought electrolytes
 
d23, weighed self-first time. Must have lost 10 pounds, 5 kg, nice to see physical evidence as I was wondering. By month 2 will be lightest I've
been since my 30s.
 
d24, another good day, first time used electrolytes. worked well. getting more interested in cooking
 
d28, realised it’s just calories in vs calories out. It’s just easier to fill up following a keto diet because you eat more dense things rather than more delicious things that are hard to stop eating
 
d29, moving into month 2, something I ate gave me bad tummy, hence downloaded App for counting macros and trying to monitor keto more strictly going forward,
felt fine in morning

I've noticed my issue is being unable to stop  munching.  Even if I just ate, I always like to get one more bit.  Just a little bit more!!!  As a result my weight always plateaus or I simply gain a pound or two which then I lose a few months later, but I am stuck hovering over the same weight, might gain a pound o lose a pound but always go back to the same thing.

I have been analyzing why do I like to eat, put something in my mouth.  I've discovered I am an anxiety eater, putting some food in my mouth makes me cope even if it's just for a couple of minutes.



As I embark on this trip, I need to start tackling that overeating, I know it's not easy but I know I can do it with patience and persistence.

1pxmlde,What's A Snack You Eat That Makes People Disgusted By You?,"I've been known throughout my life to just do weird stuff. Because I find it delicious. So while on KETO eating the same things the same way can be boring.

Eggs, Bacon, Maple Leaf Hotdogs and Cheddar.
Pork Rinds and a Nut Smoothie every day.

So when I am lazy I try mixing random things together. So here we have one of those that seems to disgust A lot of people?

I use to eat raw cooked hotdogs as a kid so I though. Huh. Why cook, just nibble.

But then I said... Hmm why eat it raw when I like it frozen? Why eat it cold when I can eat it Warm AND cold!?

The Snack that seems to sicken people is...

A frozen maple leaf hotdog dipped in bubbling microwaved cheddar cheese. The cheese freezes around the hotdogs. You get a well coated delicious cheddar cheese hotdogs popsicle.

1px84zo,Need advice indeed DS-01 Daily synbiotic - Prebiotic and probiotic for women and men.,"hi all,

I need some advice on Seed DS-01.

i am on keto for the better part of 5months, since mid august. usually follow an OMAD approach. I’ve lost consistently 3-4lbs every week. this is the second time around from about a year ago, and worked very similarly.

now the culprit:

I started taking Seed DS-01 synbiotics beginning of October, for exactly 30days. and ever since third week of taking it, ketones measured in blood do not exceed anymore 1.0, and usually hover around 0.4-0.6, with blood glucose around 85-105. weightloss also significantly slowed down and the odd thing is that correlates exactly with my usage of DS-01.

I am eating in full keto mode, very very low carb, I have literally not changed anything else, except the DS-01. I also have to loose another 50-70lbs more, so it’s plenty of fat on me to loose further and no real slowdown should be happening right now.

any thoughts on a similar experience and how to undo the damage DS-01 has done to me, my microbiome?

I got rid of dairy and also got rid of gluten but kept eating other carbs. Symptoms reduced, but stayed. Began trying to gain weight, so upped the carbs, and back came the symptoms. 

Did some research, and realised keto may be a solution..and during 3 weeks strict keto the symptoms totally went. However my weight went down which is annoying for me.

ChatGPT thinks there is research to suggest that genetics and ancestry could partly influence how compatible you are to certain ways of eating.

1pwhgfw,Day 4 and I’m miserable even with electrolytes,"I normally follow a modified AIP diet and figured going keto wouldn’t be too bad. I’m doing it for two months to reduce inflammation and hopefully help with some health issues I’ve had since I got Covid in 2020.

Since I started on Tuesday, I’ve had persistent bodyaches, headache, increased sensitivity to cold (I have a medical spray that I use on my chest and back that’s 4 sprays 2x per day and it’s now excruciating), fatigue, sleeping for 10 hours and waking up a lot. Thankfully I meal prepped before I started because it’s taking all of my willpower to do simple things like brush my teeth or prepare meals. 

I searched the sub and it seems like the number one cause of this is not having enough electrolytes or fat. Yesterday I had 6,000 mg of sodium (not including my food), 1,000 potassium, and 400 magnesium glycinate. Bumped up the sodium today and that’s still not helping. 

Breakfast has been 8 oz ground beef, 1 avocado, 1 can of sardines in olive oil, and 2 cups of cauliflower. Lunch and dinner are similar with a vegetable, lots of protein and fat. I’m dreading meals at this point because they’re heavier and more calories than what I eat usually. 

I can’t eat a lot of things that are normally allowed on this diet due to my food sensitivities (dairy, coconut, eggs, chocolate) or my doctor telling me not to eat them (berries, peanut butter). Makes things a little trickier. 

Is there anything else I can try or do I just need to tough it out for a bit longer? ",1766789413.0,5,20,keto,diet
1pwabtt,Why did you wait so long (to lose weight)? 2 healthcare professionals asked me,"Sorry, I accidentally deleted this post. Many of you had brilliant responses. 🫣 Apologies.

Original post ...

In separate incidents, my GP and another healthcare professional saw my 110lb/50kg weight loss and were impressed. I made a comment about how hard it had been to be an overweight teen and young adult in the 70s and 80s (people were really openly cruel).

They both asked me, ""Why did you wait so long?""

This comment blew my mind. It's not like I hadn't been trying‐-really, really, really trying--my whole life.

Did they really think I was fine with being obese then just wake up one day and decide to try losing weight for the first time?

Several answers I've come up with later: 

• Because healthcare professionals like you have been advising me my whole life to continue eating carbs.

• Because multiple therapists kept convincing me my weight problem was not based in my damaged metabolism but in my faulty thinking. 

• Because private gym coaches kept giving me advice that was useless at best, dangerous at worst, for a middle-aged obese person.

I went on my first diet at age 8. My mom took me to my pediatrician at 16 who prescribed speed (basically). This set me up for decades of diet pills, starvation diets, and weight regain.

I ate macrobiotic for about 10 years and was described by one man as ""the only fat macrobiotic in New York City."" I was 20lbs overweight then.

I constantly dieted, lost a few lbs, gained more for decades on low fat, low calorie diets.

I tried low carb then keto a few times before but didn't do the meal prep and freezing that makes it succeed for me now.

So, I didn't wait. I jumped in wholeheartedly. I despaired often. I became depressed and hopeless. Then jumped in again.

I will be long gone before healthcare professionals begin to get a clue what chronically obese people go through.

Maybe diet advice should only be given by formerly obese people. [Edit: I don't really mean this, just frustrated.] [Edit 2 for spelling]

1pw3pn6,Keto and FHA,"So I have a history of not healthy relationship with food and body image, quick weight loss and regain (+/- 10kg) and each time I dibble in keto, it works very well for me in terms of controlling my hunger and the food noise. I'd like to go back to it, however I suspect my poor treatment of my body caught up to me and I pretty much stopped getting my period, I get it once every few months and to my best memory, last time was half a year ago ish.

 I'm not diagnosed, but I suspect I have Hypothalamic amenorrhea (or FHA for short) and read how keto can make it even worse due to the brain not receiving insulin spikes so it doesn't know it's not starving anymore and it's safe to reproduce.

 And while not having period is great, I'm only 26 so I know in the long run it is not healthy. I was wondering if anyone here was in a similar situation and could relate or share advice.

I always craving fatty food like hamburgers, fries and carbonara spaghetti especially at night

When I increase my fat intake like olive oil, butter and eggs.

This is where I learn omega 3 is essential fatty acids where body cannot synthesize this EFAs

1pvtk9w,How I manage cholesterol successfully on keto,"I posted awhile back and this is an update!

So I'm keto low carb. I exercise regularly (7-10 hours a week). I'm not on any statins. Since I do take in lots of fat on keto I keep an eye on my cholesterol numbers. I try to exercise low carb as well so my extended multi hour long sessions are powered by fat and protein. 

Here's a comparison of my results a year apart yesterday and last year. After last year's test I wanted to bring down my LDL abit and raise HDL abit. The main dietary switch was to go from breakfast of 4 eggs seven days a week to a breakfast of 4 eggs 4 days a week, and the remaining 3 days having avocado for breakfast instead. I guess that helped a lot with fibre. So still taking in significant amounts of fat as my endurance exercise is powered by fat/protein in place of carbs.

For those on keto, I would highly recommend regular exercise to help with your numbers.
For me incorporating avocado has also seemingly been very beneficial for my LDL and HDL!

I have medical reasons for keto, and I've been on it for almost a year. Editing to say that the reason is a nasty malignant brain tumor. 
I've recently began craving chocolate cappuccino, so I've been meaning to ask about milk replacements. How good is coconut milk, and cocoa?
To be exact, coconut milk and water in a 70/30 ratio, a bit of salt and a spoonful of cocoa. I don't consume any sweeteners, so that is off the table.
Also, I can't drink almond milk. It's like water with an odd taste. I'm used to thick milk with at least 5% milk fat.
I realize this is more like regular chocolate milk, but still. 
If it's important, I wouldn't say I pass 25 g of carbohydrates in a day, most of which come from peanuts. I eat meat and salads for the most part. A few months ago I found out that psyllium husks can be used as a replacement for flour, so I've been eating sandwiches with psyllium pastries.

1pv02tp,What to do when the food pantry gives far too many fresh pears near christmas...,"Hi all, currently not doing keto, more keto adjacent.

I'm a mentally disabled single mom living off snap and ssi. Food pantry items are a major part of my diet. Also, wiyh my ibsd i have more food restrictions. Can't eat several things common with keto unless fermented because I may like them but my digestion does not.

Recently both food pantries I hit gave a crap ton of pears and apples. Apples keep well, pears do not. Most of the vegetation i can eat is fruit, including squash and zucchini and the like. But also things like pears or other high carb fruit in moderation.

Sooo, im trying to use up the pears quick, but it's not easy. So then I decided to preserve some. Well, most. So broke out the crockpot, ground cinnamon,  acv, stevia and allulose and am making fruit butter. I also recently made skyr, so took some of the whey to pickle some pears. 

I've been eating some fresh too. But still, tomorrow is Christmas, still got plenty to dispatch. Now, when I make the fruit butter and pop in a jar, as it cools it cans. So thats covered. But it leaves a lot of juice so im using thst for water keifer sugar free sodas. 

But, im thinking of making a crustless sugar free pear custard pie (think pumpkin pie minus crust, made with pears). Hopefully between all of this i will end up using up pears. 

Also, some of the fruit butter im putting in yogurt or skyr to flavor which I think might be useful to those who want healthy flavored yogurt...

I know it's not 100% sugar free. I know pears are considered high carb. But keep the amount low it's really not out of bounds. 

I figured this post might help those on a budget that includes food pantries and they get given some things typically seen as very much not useful. 

I find solutions to that.  Though rice is one my son gets far more of than myself. He's mildly autistic,  has sensory issues so is very picky. Rn he's on a beef stew with rice kick. Both I've gotten plenty of from food pantries and the beef stew has ingredients I can't have. And the rice goes great in natto for a complete protien, but I still can't eat fast enough so he's getting it more than I am. 

Also, I thought the excess pear part woukd be a bundle of laughs for anyone having a not so happy holiday season to cheer people up and add some holiday mirth and joy. ",1766618746.0,17,19,keto,diet

1punn1b,Having Trouble with Keto? Try Habit Stacking,"Hey all,

Wanted to post some (unsolicited) advice here for anyone else who has struggled to get on keto and stick with it.

I feel like I've seen a lot of posts in the past saying something like, ""I've tried keto \[X\] times but I can never stick with it. How many times did it take for you before you were able to stay with this lifestyle?""

I was also very much in this camp, and probably would have kept cycling through vowing to do keto perfectly --> succeeding for a couple weeks --> feel great, get overconfident --> binge on carbs because I don't have enough time with the new lifestyle --> repeat, until I took a ""1% better approach.""\*

As an Autistic person, I'm very ""all or nothing,"" so when the wheels started to fall off of my keto lifestyle, I said, ""F\*\*\* it, I'll just start over tomorrow,"" and would go completely off the rails.

But all those ""last suppers"" add up, and were arguably the most detrimental habit getting in the way of sticking to keto and better health. So, instead of trying to be perfect right away, I got to keto in ""phases.""

First, I gave up alcohol.

After I stuck with that for a few weeks, I gave up ultra-processed foods.

Got that part of my diet cleaned up, so I phased out solo restaurant trips.

Alright, got some distance from that? Time to give up sugar.

Did that? Cool, take out any carbs left in your diet.

Ta-da! You're keto. And guess what? Since you've been gradually working on good habits for several weeks now, it's much, MUCH harder to throw away that progress and go back to square one, even if you have a lapse. I'm still not quite 100% keto, but even so, I've lost six pounds this month just by making small, incremental changes to get there.

Someone wrote on here once, ""If you make it a lifestyle, the slow start won't matter,""\*\* and it is SO true. Also, by getting out of the perfectionist mindset, I've been able to see the positive impact even small, 1% better changes can make. And that it and of itself has been really encouraging, and kept me motivated.

Anyway. Not sure if this will be helpful to anyone, but wanted to post this in case it might provide a new approach to someone trying to make a lifestyle change.

On 7th day i weigh 204 (but feel better and look about the same).  in past traditional diet i suffered bloating almost every meal (likely from highly processed carbs etc)...now I have zero issue with eating 2300 calories of Keto diet and its great. zero bloat. zero constipation.  no puffiness/water retention issues.  I believe my maintenance calories to be 2800 so 2300 is a moderate deficit to avoid any under eating issues.  I personally would be fine at 1800 calories but may be too big a deficit even though i see 1K caloric deficit is fine.  Perhaps you can weight in on this??  

Diet is primarily eggs/avocado/cheese/chicken thigh/ground beef/macademia nuts/pumpkin seeds/sour cream.  I drink electrolytes and salt food generously.  I enter everything into MyFitnessPal religiously and zero hidden sugars or processed foods are consumed. 

I have had zero keto flu.  feel great. best feeling is the zero bloat to be honest. Not sure if its placebo feeling or the electrolytes which im told is huge when starting keto to avoid the dizziness that comes from electrolyte imbalance.

I have the Keto Mojo blood monitor.  On day 7 my fasting glucose is 110 and ketones is 0.5   The fasting glucose throwing me off.  But reading up suggests its just the body releasing stored glucose as its not fat adapted yet.

I think this post includes all the relevant info?  I'm curious what to expect over the next few weeks.  I was told because I've worked out for years that Keto may take few months  for me to 'kick in'  I'm not frustrated as I feel great and the zero bloating is the best ever.  But i am eager to start shedding some of this gut so my overall physique looks better.

Thanks for reading up until this point. Eager for experienced Keto'ers to comment

1pujydj,Constipation: suffered long time and solved it,"Hi there!

Since I suffered so long with constipation in my life but especially with keto recently, I want to share my learnings and the solution that worked for me.  Here we go:

\- physillum husks did not always work. Taken late or too much , it made things worse or me just bloated. if you can spread it through the day, maybe it supports the motility but honestly it was not a good enough solution for me

\- salt!!! I read in a keto Reddit convo and I increased my salt intake. In the mornings and before bed a pinch of salt (maybe 2) with warm water. Helped definitely with the hardness of the stool

\- magnesium : I have different kinds and I tested a lot. What worked : magnesium citrate 260-300 g fist thing in the morning with warm drink. (Other timings did not work)

\- chia bombs made the main difference. 2-3 spoons in warm water , wait 15-20 mins. Eat it like that or with nuts , berries if you want. drink 500-600ml water. This is your final bite of the day. 

So magnesium citrate, salt water and chia bomb. That’s it! I am regular and not having hemorrhoids that hurt like hell anymore.  I don’t need to force myself to hit 25g fiber or 3.5 liter water or anything. I am back to my keto diet like I want. Sometimes very low carb even without veggies on some days. it works during my period as well. Sometimes I need to take 1 laxative during 1st or 2 nd day. (Once a month is ok)

I hope this helps someone that might be as frustrated as I had been!",1766570654.0,124,18,keto,diet

1puhsf0,Reached my goal weight!,"Hey all! 

A couple of years ago, I was around 95 kilos. Male, age 40 at the time. 182cm/6ft tall.

I started weighing myself every day, hoping to figure out some way to lose weight. I stopped drinking, started going to the gym 5x per week, lifting weights and doing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. 

All of that was great, but didn't actually cause me to lose weight. Actually, due to the weightlifting (and consequent eating) I was up to 98kgs, from 93 at the beginning of summer.

My goal weight in all of this was 90 kilos (198 pounds). And back in September I heard Tim Ferriss talk about ""sardine fasting"" on his podcast. I like sardines so I decided to try it out, and felt great... but I got sick of sardines after about half a day, and decided instead to look into keto. I read the FAQ here and basically just started eating meat (or fish) and vegetables. Pretty clean keto diet.

Fast forward, I've been doing keto off and on for 4 months (I'm off it when I'm travelling or around holidays, and on it when I'm just doing my normal thing at home). I'm enjoying it a lot, I can go to the gym for 2 hours and come out and eat some chicken with bacon and feel absolutely amazing. And it's helping me lose weight, when other things didn't really work. 

I also do some fasting (20 to 36 hours when I can fit it in) and that helps. This past week, I had a stomach flu that I decided to reframe as a ""72-hour fast"". And that finally pushed me down to my goal weight – 90 kgs, AKA 198 pounds, AKA Onederland!

As a result of the upset stomach, I've basically been eating one light meal a day for several days now, and that's certainly helped. Today I'm at 88.8kg and feeling very good. 

So I wouldn't wish my stomach flu on anyone, but it seems to be what pushed me across the finish line. 

Also, I've been doing waist measurements this whole time. At the beginning, I was around 105cm (which could be a sign of metabolic syndrome, from what I've read). The waist measurement was improving even if my weight wasn't, also on keto... today it's at 92cm which is a lot better. 

So my new goal weight is 85kg and waist measurement of 90cm. Thanks to everyone in this group, especially whoever worked on the FAQ, for all the information and support.

Merry Christmas to all!

1pug4o8,Keto on the Atlantic Ocean – looking for tipss,"Hey everyone,

In a few months I'm setting off on an Atlantic crossing by sailboat.  We're moving aboard permanently to live and travel as digital nomads, so this won't be our last long passage.I want to figure out a sustainable approach to eating keto on the water. The crossing takes about 3-4 weeks, so I'm looking for tips from people who have experience with keto in situations where you're without resupply for a long time.


What we have on board:
- Gas stove for cooking
- Small freezer and fridge
- Fishing gear (we're definitely planning to catch our own!)

My challenges:
- Shelf life: the freezer is small, so not everything can be frozen
- Variety: how do I avoid going crazy after two weeks of canned tuna?
- Calories: sailing is hard work, I need enough fuel

What I have on my list so far:
- Canned fish (sardines, mackerel, tuna)
- Frozen meat and fish for the first weeks
- Dried meat

\- Tofu
- Nuts and seeds
- Avocados and cabbage (apparently last a long time)
- Coconut oil and olive oil
- Eggs (unwashed ones keep for weeks without refrigeration, right?)

\*\*What I'm curious about:
- Which vegetables last longest without refrigeration?
- Smart ways to prepare fresh catch at sea?
- Keto snacks that don't spoil quickly?

Anyway, we talked about bloodwork and she doesn't do the particle blood work but she she does look at ldl and hdl but I guess the deeper level are the sizes. She says in her pov, you either take medication or not in dealing with high cholesterol,  independent of size.

Is she right in that way of thinking or I need to push for a doctor who does the particle stuff? We are meeting again in 3 months to compare and contrast so I guess from that perspective we shall see how the numbers are...

I guess how much ""leeway"" is it for higher numbers when particles are different etc.

egfr 112 so its good, throid and other markers good except:

Cholesterol total 230

1pt3zwl,What am I doing wrong?,"Why am I not losing more weight?

I’m 60 F, and would like to lose 25 lbs to get back to my previous lifelong weight.  (140 lbs) Afrer a few months just trying to eliminate carbs where possible (removing buns and bread from burgers/sandwiches and trying for more protein based breakfasts), in early November I quit all sugar and alcohol (very moderate drinker, but a habit to drink a hard cider on stressful eves). 

Two weeks later I started keto, following along in a 4-week class of being taught the basics. The main guidelines were to start the day with fat (cream in coffee etc), 3:1 fat:protein ratio, no carbs at bfast, 20 g or less if carbs, lots of water, lots of electrolytes once in ketosis). 

I got in ketosis pretty quickly, and have been tracking glucose and ketones through carb manager. A few times I have caved in the evening (some pizza etc) and see how I’m out of ketosis the next morn but usually back in by lunch.

I have been very good about no sugar either with the exception of a little dark chocolate.

I have sadly not been exercising. Life and days have been full, or… lately I have had energy crashes in afternoon or after dinner. Maybe not enough sleep. Too much stress. Just fried, melting into the couch. 

Anyhow, I went from 164 to 160, was thrilled to hit 158 last week, and now back up to 160. In six weeks. 

It sounds like lots of people would have dropped a lot more by now.

I’m also suddenly constipated the past few days,.. have been drinking a ton of Ultima electrolytes in hopes of relieving this, but no luck so far.

I’m kind of shocked that I haven’t lost more just through the total elimination of sugar and so low carbs.

I am finding it very easy to get lots of fat, but struggling to get enough protein that doesn’t also add more fat.

1ps26uu,[2025-12-21] - [Stocking Stuffer Sunday] – Fun Keto Victories,"Hello r/keto!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

When you are a kid, the big present under the tree was ALL THAT MATTERED!!!!  It captivated our imagination for hours upon hours.  Is it a new Big Wheel?  A huge train set?  Maybe even a new bicycle that we can put together.  Christmas day, we attacked that present like that bear would attack those 100 dudes--with total carnage.  At the same time, pinned to the mantle/wall was the stocking.  When you are 6 years old, the stocking is at best an after thought.  Typically it was socks and underwear and IT'S CHRISTMAS SO WHY IS SANTA GIVING ME SOCKS AND UNDERWEAR!!!!!!!       

Jump skip to today.  As an adult, the stocking stuffer is an AWESOME present!!! Oh, it's still socks and underwear, but at some point, socks and underwear became an awesome present.  Welcome to being an adult.  I'm so old Geritol is about to be my stocking stuffer.  FREEDOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     

We have created this super duper thread so we can all share our ""fun"" victories this week.  NOT the big scale victories, but the fun little victories.  Why do we need to share these victories?  Because pretty soon, you will learn that the small victories--the stocking stuffer victories--are the ones that keep you fired up.      

Every Sunday.  A chance for you to shout above the rooftops of the world the things that improved for you this week by eating a ketogenic diet.

Searched here and google and not really finding anything. Does anyone have a simple recipe to make their own protein bars that are low carb and tasty?

1prurg1,Sodium,"Hi all. I have a question/concern about my sodium intake. I feel like it's pretty consistently high (2300+mg/day, usually about 2700-3000 mg, sometimes lower and sometimes higher). I also feel like I mitigate it for the most part, because I exercise frequently (at least 350 calories, generally) and I drink at least a gallon of water daily.

I've dropped close to 70 pounds since starting this diet (mid-August) and really my biggest issue has been trying to keep my sodium intake in check, but I also feel like my water retention has been a non-issue, my heart rate has been pretty good, and have had absolutely no symptoms of excessive sodium intake. I sleep well enough, no confusion or bloating, no spasms, and my lethargy has drastically decreased since being on the diet.

I also feel like, if I'm just trying to hit my protein and fat goals it's really difficult to avoid sodium, even in non-processed foods (ie. fresh asparagus is crazy sodium, you guys).

1pre32z,high GKI on <20g,"I'm not sure if this is inflammation or just a really bad case of insulin resistance- or if I need to go hard lipivore.

I'm reliably under 20 grams of carbohydrate every day- 95% meat with some cheese, very occasional small salad. pretty stable, but nothing changes. sometimes omad, depends on if I'm hungry.

I'll get to a GKI of 7-8 in the evenings (ketones .7 to .9, bg 89-95ish) and before noon it's almost always more like .4 and 105-110 so GKI well over 10.

Doesn't seem to change if I just have a pound of steak mid evening, or whatever.

I'm not particularly vigilant about fat content, but I definitely don't trim any off and do add some butter to most meat.

haven't tried early AM dosing (like sardines), but I'm just wondering....

  
what's going on? an alternate day fast has like, zero effect on this, too.

I do have a lot of food allergies and inflammation issues. And I need to lose a significant amount of weight. (60-80 pounds would be good, 100 might be ideal)

About a week ago the weight loss came to a screeching halt and we haven’t changed anything so we’re confused. We are both stuck at our current weight and with the exception of starving ourselves it seems to be the only way to lose another pound. 

We’ve both been intermittent fasting, pretty much down to one meal a day, dinner. We’re in a calorie deficit and we’ve stayed well below the 20g of carbs a day.

1pqp2fw,"Keto, 10th try","On my the 10th tryu at keto, so it's not my first rodeo. My first time I went from 279 to 179 in 5 1/2 months. I was pretty religious about it. I didn't care about any numbers but carbs. 20-25 or less a day. And that's all I needed.

But, I gave the weight back. First 20-30. And I got back to 190. Then up to 230, and back to 200. And then it was 235 and bacm to 210.

Most recently I hit 239. It was a bit depressing that  I knew that I knew the way, but was doing this to myself.

So this time, I started keto with One Meal a Day and a daily workout regimen. Not even two weeks in (weights  one day, and ionce the bike came, bike the next) in, and it's the most I've ever worked out.

And I've made keto fun again.

Daily dinnners: Either Turkey and gravey on two pieces of keto toast, with brussel sprouts, or bacon and eggs with toast. THrough the day I'll munch a bit on Sonoma Cheese Crisps. (Tomato basil are tastiest).

Each time I've ever started the diet, I've mapped it out in Google Sheets, forecasting a .5lb per day pace. So it started Dec. 8. My goal is 228.5 on January 1. 200 by Feb. 25. 180 by April 4 and 176 by April 16..

I've been told by many that it's an unreasinably aggressive forecast. But I know better. In fact, the forecast doesn't even account for a 4 pound woosh in the first few days of the diet. So that gives me a buffer. And OMAD (One Meal a Day) atop keto is the supercharger. If I fell behind by a pound, I could OMAD for 2-3 days to put me back on track.

So what's mad Keto fun again? The results so far have been incredible.

The pace is starting to slow after an incredible start. But I;m still averaging .75 pounds a day over this slowdown. When I look at my pace, I'm not supposed to be at 222lbs until Jan. 11-12.

I'm looking at a potential 1 day Christmas break. We'll see.,

The other important thing here is, I've upped the weights 10 pounds, which I'll probably do again in January. I'm only doing 20 minutes a day on the bike,,,, Not super high resistance, but it's been good. I intend to go to 25, then 30, while touching up the resistence a bit.

The weights are also showing the find of definition I've never really had.

Why is keto fun again, part II? Adding the exerice routine has really bumped up the curiousity. Back when I lost 100 pounds, I was so damn curious. Could I really be losing this much weight, this fast? And that curiousity and those results, kept me disciplined. And I have that curiousity again. I know I can lose the wieght. But I'm curious about two things. Can I average .75 pounds a day? If so, that's 200 ponds by January 17-18m and 180 by Feb. 13. Can I get there that much faster than expected? The other part of the curioisity is, intrigued by the definition I'm seeing, what will I look like when I hit 180 this time.

Anyway, it's been awhile since I've posted here.  Thanks for giving me a place to boast.

I had done carnivore before and the discipline aspect of it was easy for me to adhere to help challenge my Binge eating disorder and to say no to other carbs/fat filled things.

Do you have any workout routines you'd recommend? I'm not much of a gym person, I've always been more into sports (swimming, martial arts, soccer, etc.), so I'm a complete beginner. If you could give me a gym routine while on the keto diet, I would be incredibly grateful.

1pp8pdw,LDL cholesterol concern?,"Hi! I'm fairly new to keto, and I recently got bloodwork done. I saw a result that was mildly concerning. I'm getting mixed messages about whether this is a normal effect of the diet, or whether it is bad.

Some bg info: I've been on keto since April 2025, and I've lost about 15 lbs since then. I was 132 lbs in Dec 2024, 123 lbs in May, and right now I'm hovering around 108. I'm 4'11 and 21 years old. 

From May, My LDL went from 75 to 107, which was marked as high. My HDL went from 72 to 85, and my Triglycerides went from 44 to 35. Am I doing something wrong with my diet, or is this just a result of my body breaking down stored fats? For context, I know I've lost a lot of body fat because I can certainly tell that my arms and thighs are significantly skinnier, and I've typically never really lost fat on my legs until keto. For a few months straight, I was also most definitely in an accidental huge caloric deficit too (oops).

I try not to do dirty keto. I try my best to eat lots of vegetables, berries, fish, and chicken, and I try to avoid eating too much cheese (I used to eat more, but I've stopped over the past month or so.) I'm wondering if I should just cut out most forms of dairy besides maybe some plain yogurt or cream for my coffees, or stop frying foods with olive/avocado oils and butters and start baking/broiling instead?

I also don't usually have cheat days... If I do, it's still probably grainy foods with more fiber, like rice and beans. I don't typically eat junk food or fried fast foods. I don't typically reach the normal keto fat macros goal either, since I just can't force myself to eat that many fats or calories. I don't usually go over 40-60g a day.

1pp6pks,Keto Food/Cooking System,"I have a plan to eventually expand my keto, because at day 30 on it, and having done keto before on and off, I know meal fatigue, boredom, some old sugar cravings can multiply in a day and then you say, oh fuck keto and eat a chocolate croissant.

Ok day 28 of Keto, I had my first really wobbly day this time where I was really considering it calling it quits.. I just happened to read the right post on hee about regretting breaking keto and how shit it makes you feel, so I prevented myself doing it and instead branched out a little cooking and baking, which has been a joy.

The problem is cooking takes a lot of washing up, and honestly I end up finding it a bit tedious.

Hence my evebtual Food/Cooking System.

I'm going to eventually develop the proper routine where I source products, recipes or plan the future weeks keto meals, so they're easy exciting and relatively easy to enjoy and do a bunch of batch cooking on a Sunday.

Will have easy and good stock to tasty keto snacks like biltong, cakes, brownies, maybe even sugar free gummies/chocolate.

I might also get a dishwater when the time is right.

Tbh sugar cravings etc have died down very much, but really it's about having a system long term that creates the excitement, novelty, good taste, so that keto will become something that I just do, is deeply ingrained and no cognitive dissonance about sugar, old foods, comes back.",1766002258.0,3,4,keto,diet
1pp3eqw,It’s been over a month and It’s just so boring..,"Don’t get me wrong by the title, i am truly loving the results i have gotten in the past month. My starting weight was 146lbs and now I’m down 10 pounds (I don’t do much cardio, mainly weight training). The thing is, I’ve always loved food and I guess i just have always taken for granted the ease of eating quick pre-made meals or an easy and quick snack that tastes good. 
With keto, it feels like so much effort finding new meals and then making every aspect of the meal from scratch. Even snacks is tough because i hate seeds and cannot eat cauliflower. It’s especially hard when everyone else in my family is eating normal foods that i love, leaving leftovers in the fridge that i could so easily eat. Of course i wouldn’t eat these things, I’ve found that i am quite disciplined and refuse to cheat on the diet, but it’s getting so hard that i just dont eat anything if i dont want to cook. I am constantly under-eating and if i feel hungry at dinner time i just drink coffee because im so unmotivated and lazy. I guess this was just me wanting to rant i guess.

1poweu4,Anybody know low sugar candy options that don't wreck your stomach?,"been doing keto for about 8 months and honestly the hardest part isn't bread or pasta, it's having zero sweet options that don't taste terrible. i've tried lily's chocolate which is okay but expensive and sometimes gives me headaches. choczero is pretty good but hard to find. russell stover sugar free stuff destroys my stomach, like hours of pain. smartsweets are alright but still too many carbs and they're weirdly chewy.

found shameless candy last month and the OMG Peach gummies are actually good. they use erythritol which my stomach handles way better than maltitol. each serving is only 3g net carbs and no weird cooling aftertaste like choczero sometimes has. i keep a bag at work for when everyone's eating birthday cake.

1poorz6,PSA: potassium supplementation is not one size fits all,"I want to share an experience that took me a long time to understand, because potassium supplementation is often presented as universally necessary on keto, and in my case it consistently made things worse rather than better.

For context, I have an athletic background in endurance and lifting, normal blood pressure, no kidney disease, and a high sweat rate. I tolerate sodium well and do not experience edema or hypertension with higher salt intake. Like many people starting keto, I followed the standard advice to ensure adequate potassium intake, assuming that persistent fatigue or discomfort meant I needed more of it.

What I observed over repeated trials was a very consistent pattern. Potassium supplementation in the form of powders, pills, or electrolyte mixes reliably caused increased urination, urinary urgency, fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance, and a generalized flat or depleted feeling. These effects occurred despite adequate hydration and calorie intake. In some cases there were also mild gastrointestinal symptoms. This response was reproducible and reversed when potassium supplementation was stopped.

In contrast, increasing sodium intake reliably improved energy, exercise tolerance, and overall stability. When I eliminated potassium supplements entirely and obtained potassium only from whole foods, keto became sustainable and predictable instead of feeling physiologically stressful. This pattern has held across multiple cycles and training phases.

From a physiological perspective, this makes sense in at least some individuals. Low carbohydrate intake reduces insulin, which increases renal sodium excretion. Water follows sodium, reducing effective circulating volume. For individuals who already tend toward renal sodium loss or high sweat sodium output, the primary limiting factor may be volume depletion rather than potassium deficiency. In that context, potassium supplementation can worsen symptoms by promoting natriuresis and further reducing circulating volume, even if total hydration appears adequate.

This does not mean potassium is unnecessary or harmful in general. Many people on keto clearly benefit from potassium supplementation, particularly those with low dietary intake, high insulin resistance, or different renal handling of electrolytes. The point is that electrolyte requirements and responses are individual, and symptoms should guide intervention rather than assuming a universal deficiency.

I am not suggesting that people stop potassium supplementation across the board. I am suggesting that if keto feels persistently worse despite following standard electrolyte advice, and potassium consistently worsens symptoms while sodium improves them, that response is meaningful and worth paying attention to. Electrolyte balance is more nuanced than most beginner advice implies.

I am posting this because it took me years to realize that something widely recommended as essential was actually the main factor preventing keto from working for me. I am curious whether others have had similar experiences, either positive or negative, and whether sodium turned out to be the limiting factor rather than potassium.",1765950380.0,63,25,keto,diet
1ponz5a,"A question for those who have lost more than 10kg successfully with Keto.

What I want to ask  those who have experienced  genuinely losing weight (10kg or more, I think that’s the same as 20pounds or more) on keto diet, did you lose weight by counting Net or total carbs? I know some people do Keto for general health, but you’re already healthy, fit, slim etc. I’m asking the oeople here who were overweight, unfit, maybe even unhealthy… who came to keto because of a serious need to lose weight. Did you ever sucessful weight loss by counting net carbs only? and if so, did you have a limit on total carbs aswell? Is weight loss only possible by counting total carbs?  

And, while you’re here, can I also ask did you lose weight by also trying to maintain  a caloric deficit, or was there no need to focus on caloric deficit? Did you also limit dietary fat (in order to burn more fat off the bod) or not worry about this?

I have salt and lite salt each day, I make sure to get a lot of it with my water and magnesium every night, so I don’t think it’s electrolytes. Blood ketones consistently tests above 1 mmol per liter, at times getting above 3. Typically within 1.5-3 range.

1po3yoa,"Day 29 of Keto. Just made a 12/10 keto curry.. Making me realise with time Keto does not mean restriction or deprivation, just needs creativity.","I just made an absolutely delicious curry. So delicious, in fact, I decided the people of reddit must know about it.

It was pretty basic, I bought a jar of Thai curry paste with 10g carb per 100g, it was the lowest carbs per gram of the curry pastes I could buy.

I bought double cream, chicken stock which I also salted (I take electrolyte pills but think added sodium helps, you learn to interocept, light headedness, mild irritability etc).

I had pre finely chopped cauliflower which I fried in olive oil till nice golden brown as my substitute for rice.

I lightly fried/browned off my chicken, in olive oil.

I added about 2 scoops of the paste which I estimated at 7g carb probably.

I added the double cream and some chicken stock which I then simmered to reduce.

I then poured my  Thai curry on the bed of cauliflower.

I thought it would taste nice, but I was so pleasantly surprised, it was fucking delicious.

Sometimes in cooking things turn out better than you imagined, and this was one of those occasions.

I'm doing keto to lose weight but also, arguably more importantly, I want to keep to it long term for metabolic/serious mental health issues.

This one meal has made me realise, with time, and the means. Keto does not mean any restriction.. And with all the benefits I get with it? It feels like the perceived negatives of it being ""restrictive"" will be history when I learn to expand my keto cooking repertoire.

I'm so happy.

It's made me think sugar is this addictive white powder which when separated from the real taste pallate of foods, doesn't add much to one's life.. but brings inflammation, ups and downs, turbulence, and it's just, for me, better out my life.

1pn49v8,"High Ketone, low glucose, high resting HR, 3 weeks into strict keto","Hello all.
I have been very active on here but I finally start with my first post. And it's interesting that everyone always start with this when they kind of hit a dead end and need some advice.

I'm in a stage that no AI or Google search or doctor can help me.

I have been dealing with eating disorder since I started my strength training 3 years ago. I was always in the loop of restricting calories to keep my six pack and binge eating 15k calories because my body was starving and the fast or restrict calories again. So I ended up ripped and weak.
I have started keto 5 month ago but on an off not strict and liked it as it helped me reduce my binge.

Past 3 weeks I have been i strict keto. 15g max carb. Sometimes even 5. My diet mainly consist of egg meat, cheese, tallow and protein powder.
My macro are between 78 to 80% from fat calories then 18 to 20 protein and 1 to 2% carb. I aim to eat at 2900 calories. Minimum 130g protein a day. That's about 1g/lean body mass.

I have my electrolytes tight. My water volume is tracked 4.5liter a day. Sodium 6g and potassium 3g and magnesium around 500mg total per day spreaded.

Here comes my issue. I have been getting very high ketone reading on my ckm. Also checked against blood meter 0.4mmol less maybe on blood. And low glucose. I hyper active. But my brain sometimes have difficulty expressing words or sentences. I wake up in middle of night for example last night as you see chart below when I was at 7mmol ketone and had high HR.
Right now I'm writing this I'm around 7 again. Only had breakfast as attached. As I was in hotel my measurements are slightly estimated.

The thing is no doctor can help me. I went through eating disorder rehab and they wanted me to follow a program where 9 don't count anything and eat carbs and sweet. I rejected as I know myself and my body. I love my current diet as I'm eating 2900 calories and I'm full and I haven't binge for 3 weeks now. Although sometime I consume 4500 calories and next day eat 1500.

Also I train 5 times a week and do short cardio 40 min a week total. My HR is in sky 83 percent max during my cardio. Before keto was at 70 percent maybe. I have become super stronger. I lift heavier and I don't need any food or pre workout before my workout.
I'll see how I can upload my readings

My readings 
https://postimg.cc/gallery/Gh0h9qS 

Update:
I do not consume alcohol regularly. 
No diabetes that I know of. Glucose started dipping in week 3 of keto. I was hovering above 5 below 5.5. Just when ketone started going higher. 

I track ketones to see response to different food. I would stop it after this sensor. 
I do see correlation between my brain fog and high ketone. The higher my ketone the harder for me to write or make up sentences completely without thinking. 
I find it also hard to find folders where I saved them on computer. 
My eyes burns 
My sleeping RHR increased to 64 from 49 pre keto diet. 
My hrv dropped from 47 average over night to 24 average over night.

1pn43ca,Why Does My Body React Badly to Potassium Supplements? (Electrolytes),"I’ve noticed that I can’t tolerate potassium supplements used for electrolytes. Sodium and magnesium are fine for me, but even a small dose of potassium, such as potassium citrate at 200–300 mg causes symptoms like flushing, headaches, and a weird anxious feeling.

I’ve also experienced similar reactions with calcium supplements when taken in larger doses. I’m trying to understand why this happens and whether others have experienced the same issue.

  
I see people taking like 1000 grams for electrolytes.

1pn1w37,So so helpful for my lipedema,"I (40F) broke keto on Thanksgiving but after 48 hours (this weekend) I'm back in fat-burning mode! Kind of glad I keep experimenting with this (fifth time now?) because every time the result is the same: 

After \~24h my face slims out and I'm not sneezing and itching anymore

24-48 hrs in: eyes become shiny, ankle cuffs go away (I have lipedema but normal BMI), ""ripping"" pain in thighs decreases

At 48-ish hours (where I'm at now): acetone breath comes on, pain in my hands and feet suddenly VANISHES, the swelling in my thighs starts to decrease, the ""whoosh"" of water weight loss begins!

I guess the point of my post is that discovering keto has been a godsend for me. I heard about it from the lipedema board here on Reddit. I was in so much pain I was bawling in the ER. No drugs helped even a little bit, but keto takes the inflammation away and gives me such strong, steady energy. I only wish I had learned this way of eating sooner in my life, I probably could have stunted the development of the lipedema by controlling my inflammation, but I'm thankful now to have this tool to reduce my pain!

I was surprised at the result.   At the end of our pick up game, I was a considering playing another as there was little pain in my legs, even though my work rate was pretty good.  Decided against it but kept the fast going.

Today got out of bed, put feet on ground and transferred body weight, then started walking.  It's almost like I didn't play at all on arthritic knees and scar tissue Achilles tendons yesterday.

1pm9nrd,[2025-12-14] - [Stocking Stuffer Sunday] – Fun Keto Victories,"Hello r/keto!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

When you are a kid, the big present under the tree was ALL THAT MATTERED!!!!  It captivated our imagination for hours upon hours.  Is it a new Big Wheel?  A huge train set?  Maybe even a new bicycle that we can put together.  Christmas day, we attacked that present like that bear would attack those 100 dudes--with total carnage.  At the same time, pinned to the mantle/wall was the stocking.  When you are 6 years old, the stocking is at best an after thought.  Typically it was socks and underwear and IT'S CHRISTMAS SO WHY IS SANTA GIVING ME SOCKS AND UNDERWEAR!!!!!!!       

Jump skip to today.  As an adult, the stocking stuffer is an AWESOME present!!! Oh, it's still socks and underwear, but at some point, socks and underwear became an awesome present.  Welcome to being an adult.  I'm so old Geritol is about to be my stocking stuffer.  FREEDOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     

We have created this super duper thread so we can all share our ""fun"" victories this week.  NOT the big scale victories, but the fun little victories.  Why do we need to share these victories?  Because pretty soon, you will learn that the small victories--the stocking stuffer victories--are the ones that keep you fired up.

1pm8c9s,Keto for mental health - low ketones despite strict diet,"Hello everyone! I tried posting this about a month ago but it never got approved. Hopefully now I've answered some other's questions this will get posted.

I started keto for mental health around about last February. I have been pretty strict from the start, aiming for less than 20g next carbs and I think I have pretty much always stayed under 30g even on days where I've been going a bit wild 😜. Even on holidays and things, I've lost all desire to eat carby food. 

Sadly, the diet hasn't had as great an effect on my treatment resistant depression and anxiety as I had hoped and I've been moving into a deeper depressive state lately. I've even decided to leave my stressful job with no backup because it was not tenable (my doc also increased my SSRI dose but I am still moving into deeper depression rather than out.)

I believe that the source of the problem is the fact that I rarely exhibit very high ketone levels, despite being strict with carbs if not calories. If I'm in a major deficit I seem to be able to get into higher levels of ketosis, but I've already lost all the spare weight I was carrying about and I'm not happy with the way clothes sit on me anymore, so I don't want to lose more. 

I am 33f, about 65kg at 5'8"" and relatively active (due to massive nervous energy, a small child and a high energy dog rather than a structured exercise routine. I'm also hyper mobile which seems to contribute to me having more muscle tone than one would really expect). Like I said, I stay below 20g carbs and I normally eat about 70-75% of my calories in fat. I rarely get up to 2mmol/l of ketones these days and often am barely in ketosis even when I test well fasted. My blood glucose is also often very high, regularly into prediabetic levels. I don't eat ANY prepackaged ""keto"" foods.

1plf3ms,How to keep face lean without eating ridiculously strictly,"Title says it all. The only way I have found to keep my face fully lean/water weight free, no matter how shredded my body is, is by eating a lion diet. HIITs also help a lot, but my face is less lean even on regular carnivore, doing HIITs, than it is on lion diet without exercising. But I don’t want to eat just beef for the rest of my life. However, I have noticed that when I start eating relatively healthy carbs, especially not right before bed, the water weight takes several days to get back into my face (and all those times, I haven’t been working out, since it’s usually a vacation or break). Do any of you have any experience with this? Can I, through exercise, proper foods/nutrients and proper eating times, maintain the same level of facial definition on a keto or paleo or animal-based diet that I do on lion diet, and to a lesser extent general carnivore?

Edit: in my experience, it almost seems like a bunch of eggs, bacon, etc. (just not beef or lamb or fish) causes more facial bloating than if I eat an apple or some peppers or something. Just to clarify further. How much does adapting to a diet matter? For instance, when I’m on carnivore, if I eat some bread I am guaranteed to get significant facial bloating, whereas if I’ve been on Thanksgiving break for a week and eating accordingly, then bread will hardly change anything. I guess what I’m getting at is if I slowly introduce eggs, other meats, fruits, nuts and some vegetables to my diet, will my body adapt and eventually allow me to keep the same facial leanness that I’d have on lion diet?",1765608851.0,6,39,keto,diet
1plef5s,Need recs for shelf stable snacks.,"I had an accident on Thanksgiving and fractured and dislocated my ankle and broke some bones in my feet. I am currently nonweightbearing on one of my feet, and I am in a nursing home until December 23, when I can get a follow up appointment with my surgeon.

I have explained many times to the dietetics department that I am a T2 diabetic, but the meals that they give me are practically poison. For example, breakfast yesterday was a hard boiled egg, a strip of bacon, a pancake, light syrup, a cup of oatmeal, and a cup of cranberry juice cocktail. I ate the egg and bacon and drank an Atkins shake.

In addition to the shakes, I ordered some packages of tuna, bags of flavored nuts, and bag of mini Gouda cheese, although I ate those within two days. I also bought single portion packages of cottage cheese ""with fruit,"" but it turned out the fruit was heavily processed and sweetened.

I desperately need some recommendations for some keto friendly snacks that are shelf stable and don't require cooking. I don't have access to anything resembling a kitchen, including refrigeration or a microwave.

Thanks in advance.

1plb9th,Nutrient Balance Question for Ex-carnivores,"Hi all! Please be gentle with me if any of you think carnivore is wacky. 

I've been carnivore for the last year or so and it's been transformative for my health, but I'd like to transition to keto, and would like tips from others who made the same transition. I'm especially interested in other ex-carnivore women, but open to male insights too. 

Basically, I'm hoping to retain the benefits I got from carnivore, while improving things further with the re-addition of some plants, but I'm hoping to avoid accidentally reintroducing plants that block absorption of certain nutrients from meat, or reintroduce some other negative effect. For example, carnivores have found that beef alone contains enough Vitamin C for humans, so long as we don't also eat glucose (which blocks Vitamin C absorption); most plants will break down to glucose, and if eating glucose, we do need to add back a more substantial Vitamin C source. (I'm not sure just how much glucose tips the scale here.) But in my head, natural sources of high Vitamin C mostly means fruit e.g. oranges, which I'm concerned would immediately jump the carb count to accidentally leave keto. And would likely reignite my cravings for more unhealthy sugary things. 

Benefits I got from carnivore: 

* Significant fat loss while retaining muscle, stable across time;
* Huge boost to mental health (lifelong depression lifted; anxiety lifted); this is probably the most important part for me that I *don't* want to lose, and I believe remaining in therapeutic ketosis is core to this benefit;
* Skin improved;
* Complete disappearance of sugar cravings.

Main issue I've struggled with on carnivore, that I hope to fix by reintroducing plants per keto:

* Dizziness/faintness (requiring electrolyte supplements). This is intermittent, and *sometimes* I have this amazing stable energy that allows for a lot of physical activity... but other times, I almost faint just from standing in the shower, and I need two packets of electrolytes to continue with my day. Obviously, this interferes with activities of daily living, and I don't think it's a reasonable status quo. I think a healthy human diet, which does *not* involve fainting, should be possible from whole foods alone, no supplements. Part of my problem may be that I struggle to eat a high enough calorie count on carnivore because satiation comes so quick (meat has also wildly gone up in price), so if I could just eat more meat I might not have this problem... but right now I can't. Therefore interested to see if re-adding a few plants per keto is a helpful alternative. 

Any thoughts from other ex-carnivores? What all did you add back, and how did that experience go for you? 

I don't want to exceed 20g total carbs per day as it's my understanding that this is the general safety cutoff for remaining in therapeutic ketosis. Some individuals might stay in therapeutic ketosis at a higher carb level, but we'd need to test ourselves to know if that's us, and until then I'd like to stay in the safe zone. My mental health issues come back when I leave ketosis, and after re-entering ketosis it still takes a few weeks for my moods to settle back to where I want to be, so I just don't want to deal with that. 

Thank you for any insights from fellow travellers on this road!",1765595976.0,2,21,keto,diet
1pl6m01,Does the frequency that you eat matter on Keto?,"I know when eating normally it matters because everytime you eat bloodsugar rises and there is no way fat will be burned.

1pl473s,High-fat snacks,"So one of the reasons why I went keto is because fats apparently have a healing effect on my gut. To put it simply, I have digestive issues - some sort of IBS perhaps - that stem primarily from carbohydrate intolerance. But carbohydrate intolerance is *not all of it*. In fact, it seems like the main factor is lack of fat. Whether it is too much protein or too much carbs, low-fat foods cause me similar symptoms (stomach pain, nausea, digestive issues...). Overall I've had to go to 80% - 90% of calories from fat, as anything less than that causes me issues.

But other than eating straight butter, what would be the best high-fat snacks?",1765576150.0,15,74,keto,diet

1pkha2x,2 months in,"So I've been doing Keto for two months now and I'm feeling great. I am doing it for therapeutic reasons (diagnosed Autism, plus accompanying anxiety etc), but am benefiting from increased energy, clearer thinking, increase in EF, decrease in sensory overload. It's frustrating that some of my more ""core"" deficits seem about the same, but I am really pleased with how much it is helping.

I was about 25kg overweight, and I've lost 11.5kg, so I'm also really pleased with that although it's frustrating wardrobe-wise. Exercise still feels really overwhelming (leading to a feeling like I'm going to have a meltdown), especially higher intensity, which is disappointing, but I'm hoping that will pass if I keep working at low to moderate intensity with weights a few days a week that this will pass.

As an aside, I posted a few weeks ago about my RHR being still very high and my HRV being extremely low, and a lot of people said I needed to be supplementing more potassium and sodium, despite having decent dietary intake. I did do that, and it stayed the same and I felt like it was making me bloated. I stopped supplementing 9 days ago and immediately my RHR and HRV returned to pre-keto normal, so I'm wondering if I just needed longer to adjust to the diet.

I am currently living in Spain and have questions about two products.



1) Electrolytes: I bought a well-known brand and when I checked the ingredients, I saw that they contain MALTODEXTRIN. From what I can see, I understand that this would not be ideal as it can raise my blood insulin levels, but then I checked the frequently asked questions on the product page, and the brand itself responds that maltodextrin is used for “technological food purposes” and does not act as a nutrient or produce any physiological effects as such. Is this really the case? On the other hand, are the daily values they indicate good, or should I make my own electrolytes that are more concentrated?

[Product](https://we.tl/t-ixKfUCOXyN) [Question](https://we.tl/t-kJ95EFlqgp)

2) I bought some erythritol at the supermarket, but I see that it is 99.5% erythritol and 0.05% sucralose. I consume about 10 grams a day in my coffee with zero-calorie almond milk. Is this a problem? I understand that they always say that the problem lies in the quantities, but would such a small percentage of sucralose be a problem?

1pi0dll,Hey experienced Keto folks: I can’t get more than 2 cups of veg per day and stay under 20g net carbs. Is anyone actually eating 7-8 cups of veg per day and staying under 20g?,"So i have a question aboit Dr Bergs advice on eating 7-8 cups of veg per day. I actually like salad annd begues and I WANT to eat 5cups of veggies per day. But  I’ve tried every which way of measuring salads, low carb veggies, leafy greens etc. I can not in any combination make 7 -8 cups of veg per day while staying under 20g of net carb. 7-8 cups is at the very least gona be 30-50g net of carbs per day.

2 cups of veg is the most I can get in a day and stay under 20g.

Has anyone  sucessfully stayed  in ketosis or got into ketosis on a diet high in salad and low carb  much veg per day? (ie, 10-30 extra  net carbs per day  that are only coming from  low carb veg?) what do the experienced keto folks think: is it worth getting all that veg? or just skip it and try to focus on staying  in ketosis?",1765261556.0,94,140,keto,diet

1ph01n9,How long until fatigue lifts? 2nd go.,"Hello everyone. 

This is my second go on Keto. I did keto two years ago for 8 months. I did carnivore afterwards for 6 weeks. I got scared of my crazy ldl numbers but I was feeling fantastic on keto. 

I got back on the low carb life since then. I do fast 18;6 everyday since 3 years and I do 1-2 24hrs fast per week, depending on my schedule. 

Last time I transitioned to keto, I wasn’t anxious, depressed or burn out. 

Now, im really struggling with fatigue, anxiety and depression these days so I told myself I would try keto again. I tried keto 5 weeks ago for a couple of days but ultimately, I couldn’t bare the fatigue. 

I since then remembered and read about salt. I already take magnesium and potassium. So I added 2.5g of sodium to my ketoade and I calculated a good 2.5-3.5g from my food itself. 

The question is, what is the trick to actually function through my day without having to take a 2 hr nap everyday until I transition to ketosis ? Because it’s brutally killing me… or maybe im just too burn out already to give my body an additional stress ? 

I do presently fast. And I weight train as well. 

Anyone been through this before ? Thanks.

1pgo8a2,Navigating all the information for the keto diet is challenging,"Hey folks! as the title suggests, the amount of information (good and bad) can be a bit overwhelming and was looking for the community to help. I hope this is the right thread to drop this in.

Little background.  
I started a more carnivore diet about 10 weeks ago. The results have speak for themselves.  
\- Down almost 40 pounds  
\- I feel better overall. I used to have intestine problems. Gone.  
\- skin feels better (less dry skin)  
\- stomach fat noticeably gone. Clothes fit great.  
\- I feel like I am 15 years younger (48yo M).

I really try to keep things as simple as possible with my diet.  
I do the obvious with a low carb diet. No breads, rice, crackers, chips, junk, potatoes...the usual suspects.   
My diet has been primarily:  
\- beef, pork, eggs, some cheese, heavy cream with coffee, MCT, whole fat yogurt (home made) butter, sprinkle in some cauliflower, broccoli some leafy greens.

  
Probably more carnivore-ish right now, but I have been exploring moving to Keto for couple reasons.

That said, I am going in for my first blood work in January and I am a bit nervous.  
I have been trying to be a sponge to learn as much as I can about carnivore and keto.   
But the volume of resources and info is staggering and trying to put it all together is challenging. (I read/watch Dr. Ken Berry, Dr. Chaffe, Dr. Berg as my gotos....)

What confuses and confuses me is when I see folks post their lab results and their levels are ""bad"" or out of whack, which instantly makes me think ""what is going on and will that happen to me"". A bit of anxiety does start to creep in.  
I am looking for some suggestions from the community on where I can further learn to improve my diet and any caveats/concerns I should be looking out for (outside of the Dr. probably get upset when he sees my LDL up an wants to prescribe a statin.)

I consider myself a healthy, active individual. I do workout several times a week, mixing in variety including hiking/walking, kettlebell training and swimming when its warm enough.

Looking at my staples above, should I consider cutting things out? In my research and reading other folks post, I have seen folks recommend taking out things like dairy as it might contribute to some of the blood results with cholesterol/trigs etc.

I hope this makes sense. The diet so far has been great so now it is just me being diligent, finding what i need to tweak and tune to keep on the right track and do the right thing.

Always appreciate the feedback from the community. It has always been fantastic and helpful.

Much obliged!",1765128968.0,12,31,keto,diet

1pgipre,Rate my keto approach,"I am not overweight or anything, 45yo now, just doing my own research for the past 5 years - even before I started keto I was already on low carb - my BMI is \~23 and seems to work out fine for me - I am doing daily exercise at home to increase by muscle weight. 3 years into it.

I am doing OMAD with 2 caloric beverages and that means:  
\- At 8 and 11 - low caffeine coffee with 50g butter and 25ml MCT c8 (more or less - I have never measured exactly - just by eye) and small spoon of organic cocoa  
\- At 17 full meal - usually grounded beef (1.2-2.2g/kg of body mass) or fish (sardines in olive oil or doradas from owen) always few eggs, some raw milk cheese on top, everything sprinkled with good quality olive oil. For veggies raw organic sauerkraut, water salt cucumbers, olive oil garlic.

For exercise I do it always by the trigger - for example - going to the toilet - 10 pushups, going to living-room - 5 pull-ups, waiting for coffee to brew 20 slopes, stuck in a call - 50 dumbbell reps. (atomic habits xD )

With this I was able to go to 4.5 ketones (blood) If I do one full day of fasting, but usually it hangs between 1,5 and 2,5.

Blood-work looks good (since I did it I have increased B12 and D3 intake with ADEK), a bit higher cholesterol, I am adding more omega3 now into diet. 

HPLC - 12,49 umol/l  
Cholesterol overall - 316 (triglycerides 65, LDL 238, non-LDL 250)  
Insuine 4.4 mU/I  
Testo O41 - 539

Supplements:  sodium, potassium, magnesium, B complex + B12 and lots of water during the day. I use a pinch of mined raw salt for each glass of water during the day - trying to keep it consistent - every 1-2 hours. Potassium and magnesium (glycinate) in the morning and evening.  
I have also started supplementing copper biglycinate 2mg/day  
My approach - I suplement 1 week, then 1 week off.  
When I feel low on energy - pinch of salt with glass of water solves the problem.

Results that I have observed - most came within 6 months from starting, the it improved with time:  
\- brain fog completely gone - I feel like I am 20yo again - while on MCT-C8 - even better  
\- body inflammation - non-existent anymore (I had few broken bones and inflammation in those areas)  
\- sleep improved dramatically, I sleep 7-9h, before I could do 5-6 and was always tired  
\- stress levels decreased - I feel much more calm, can focus on meditation easily  
\- motivation and learning capabilities - increased  
\- some digestive issues I had dramatically decreased, I had recurrent diarrhea for few years before I started, now I have perfect poo and do the toilet business in 2 min, not 15 like in the past - also I withdrew hemorrhoids I noticed those started appearing before my journey. (Also the Squatty potty helped a lot)  
\- my body type went from weak to muscular due to regular short training sessions - t-shirt size from loose L to tight XL with lean muscular - my wife is overwhelmed xD

At the same time, pinned to the mantle/wall was the stocking.  When you are 6 years old, the stocking is at best an after thought.  Typically it was socks and underwear and IT'S CHRISTMAS SO WHY IS SANTA GIVING ME SOCKS AND UNDERWEAR!!!!!!!       

Jump skip to today.  As an adult, the stocking stuffer is an AWESOME present!!! Oh, it's still socks and underwear, but at some point, socks and underwear became an awesome present.  Welcome to being an adult.  I'm so old Geritol is about to be my stocking stuffer.  FREEDOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     

We have created this super duper thread so we can all share our ""fun"" victories this week.  NOT the big scale victories, but the fun little victories.  Why do we need to share these victories?  Because pretty soon, you will learn that the small victories--the stocking stuffer victories--are the ones that keep you fired up.

1pg1809,Keto + Gym Training… Looking for Advice,"Hey all,
I’ve been doing keto/low-carb for a couple of years and have lost about 5 stone in that time. I’ve learned a lot about food and it’s genuinely been life-changing for me.

I started going to the gym about 12 weeks ago. I’ve kept things low carb the whole time, but I haven’t been fully in ketosis. I’ve also put a few pounds on since starting, so I wanted to dive fully back into keto again — especially because I’ve got a lot coming up at work and I really rely on ketones for focus and mental clarity.

Last night I had a fitness test and, for the first time in months, my ketones were at 1.8. But wow… the workout absolutely destroyed me. Total weakness, classic “keto flu” feeling, everything just felt like pure pain.

So I’m wondering:
Does anyone here have experience with doing keto while training consistently?
	•	Do strength and energy come back once you push through the transition phase?
	•	Or does the body just need carbs to perform well in the gym?

Another issue I have is that if I do eat carbs, I tend to binge — and I hate that about myself. So I’m really torn. I want to make progress at the gym, but not at the cost of losing the keto/low-carb lifestyle that’s helped me so much.

I feel much more even emotionally. I don't actually feel sad anymore, which is a huge positive. Usually my ketones in the morning are about 1.5-1.8. Throughout the day they are in 2.0- 2.1

I have a hard time fasting bc I get migraines, and they are triggered by fasting. Also have many food intolerances. Also just can't motivate myself to get out of bed much. Which is what I am really wanting at this point.

I have been able to eliminate 1 of my medications, and starting to taper off another medication. That is a huge win for me.

It is so odd but I feel in my brain when I get to 2.0 ketones or above. It is like I feel like my brain starts to breathe or gets some sort of energy . I'm wondering if anyone else feels this?

So I am getting so tired of still being bed ridden, and wondering if this will one day help? I just want to lead a normal life...

Also any tips or tricks to get ketones higher, especially overnight to wake up in deeper ketosis?

Things I already do is use MCT oil, although not super consistent with it. Butter and cream in coffee. Keeping my protein down, about 50-60 grams, and net carbs under 20.

Does anyone use exogenous ketones? Would that maybe help to get me higher ketones and possibly get me to start exercising?

1pfiu9h,What advice would you give yourself if you could go back in time as a beginner on Keto diet?,"hi Keto people. I’m reaching out to ask for some advice and maybe peer support - for someone who is  just starting Keto. 

my reason for starting is I have crap energy levels. super lethargic. feel like I’ve got chronic fatigue or something. I have read about the benefits of ketosis on energy and healing energy issues.. 

 not sure I really know what I’m doing though. I have tried Keto before and it didnt feel good- but  I think I didn’t do it right. so I was bouncing from sugar to ketones . 

I’ve looked into carnivore diet too- but I rather like leafy greens and herbs and spices too much , I can’t eat steak every day on its own.  

I get the concept of high fat and high protein, but  where I get confused is that when I count my macros on the “fat secret app”, it basically says that 2 cups of veggies will equate to 20g of carbs in a day. But this is super restrictive because I also need to drink milk and yoghurt too which put my total carbs up to aboit 30-40g per day. 

 am I thinking wrong??  do I not count veggies at all? I’ve heard some people say don’t count the veggies just eat as much veggies, meat and fat and dairy and eggs as you want- is that right? which is true?

the veggies I wouldn’t count would be kale, carrots, cabbage, sourcrout, fennel, celery, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, garlic, ginger green onions. 

so is that true? don’t count veggies?

but when  it comes to tomatoes, avocado or berries, or dairy, you would count those carbs.  cos they’re sweeter? 

and you avoid fruits altogether unless it’s part of your daily  20g? 

this is where it gets confusing, because the goal is ketosis, not “low carb”. I don’t have strips. should I  mess around with strips? or is it better to get my habits correct? 

im trying to lose some weight too- I haven’t done any excersise for months though  because of this hellish and debilitating lack of energy. but once I’ve got energy I will start working out with weights, walking, Pilates.

 has Keto helped any of you guys with energy levels? what aboit at first when you’re adjusting to ketones? does it get worse before it gets better? 

what advice would you give yourself if you were just starting out again?

https://old.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1nrzjxl/the_scale_didnt_lie_50_pounds_down_thank_you_all/

I started this journey at the end of June this year, and it's been amazing. 

I had two cheat days- My Birthday and Thanksgiving. I see no problems with that either :) 

This is a mix of Intermittent Fasting (12p-8p) as well as Keto/Law Carb. I add Low Carb because I feel there are times I didn't get enough fat content even though I ate healthy. 

What worked for me- Simple but fun recipes. 

Of course, Hamburgers, Steak (lots of steak), eggs, bacon, etc. But taking some things, I loved before and just tweaking it a little bit, like Taco Salads, Wings, Pork Chops, and so on. 

Additionally, I hit the gym 5-6 times a week. Every day at the gym is cardio on the Elliptical, the least amount of time is 30 minutes. Full days give me a full weight cycle and 60 minutes of the Elliptical. 

I still enjoy my snacks. Quest Cookie Bars- at first, I hated them, but I found out 30 seconds in the microwave changes them. Quest Chocolate Chip Cookies, Quest Protein Chips (Great in Taco Salads too!), String Cheese, Chomps Beef Sticks, and ISOPure Zero Carb Protein with a splash of Mio after the gym. I also recently found Spylt Milk Caffeine Protein Shakes, and they are simply amazing too. 

This journey has been great, not only for my body but my spirit and mind too. 

For all those going strong- you got this.

1pfa2wj,Thinking of leaving Keto as I'm losing too little too slow,"I've started keto in September and I fell in love with the life changes it brought me. Most importantly, I've changed my relationship with food, and most specifically with carbs - I couldn't imagine I could have so much energy without them.

I was 109kg when I started and I'm 99.5kg three months later. 

While I'm happy with the results, I feel that the more I go ahead the slower I lose weight. And, although I recognize the benefits of being on keto, it's also a lot of sacrifice.

Being carbs-free in Italy is a challenge when you done out. Never eating any pizza or drink any wine is also hard.

So I'm at that stage where I'm questioning my journey and I'm not even sure it's worth it anymore to lose barely 500 grams a week.

I read about people knocking off 15kg a month so I really don't get it.

1pf5aho,Keto dumplings/gnocchi,"I’ve been experimenting with the base pasta dough from black tie kitchen site in an attempt to shape other pastas besides fettuccine and I’ve come up with a dumpling/gnocchi style addition for soups. I made chicken gnocchi soup and it’s delicious. Does it taste just like gnocchi or the olive Olive Garden soup? No! But it’s a yummy substitute. 

Ratios below for 1 egg

1 medium egg raw  
2 tablespoons vital wheat gluten flour  
2 tablespoons lupine flour  
A pinch of salt, optional 1/2 teaspoon or more psyllium husk only if needed. 

Mix ingredients with a spoon in a bowl until combined. Have your soup or liquid simmering on low and drop a small amount of dough (think dime size). I put the spoon in the liquid and shake the dough off gently. If it falls apart, add psyllium husk a little at a time and test your dough again. Let it swell and see if you like the size of one dumpling before you add more. The smaller the better as they taste better and cook faster. I made them the size of my thumbprint after swelling by dropping about half teaspoon amount of dough in water. They need to be simmered in the soup or broth for about 5-20 mins or so. They’re done pretty fast but they just get softer the longer you cook them. Test the consistency as needed. ",1764965373.0,2,6,keto,diet

1pecl00,Whatever happened to Sated (Ketolent / Keto & Co); what's better?,"I was heavy into Keto from 2018 - 2021 (lost 60 lbs in that timeframe!); maintained for a couple of years; then inevitably allowed myself to ""live a little"", and now I've given up half of that progress in the last 2 years.

I attribute much of my success to Sated (Ketolent, if you're more familiar with that name), since I even came to Keto through being previous Soylent devotee. Sadly, Sated seems to be largely defunct. I sent an email to them 2 years ago that went unanswered, and I'm not confident they'd even ship out the products they claim to have on their website.

For me (and I imagine most of us), ""the quickest and easiest path to silence hunger"" is critical. Before I went OMAD, I could have Sated in the morning and be good til dinner.

The powder itself was \~$2.10/serving (adding my own oil to that (which I later had to do when they stopped selling theirs) didn't increase it by much). I'm seeing stuff on Amazon anywhere from $4-$6 per serving which is wild. 

TL;DR: I'm genuinely interested if anyone knows what actually happened to Sated. Otherwise, what's out there that tastes decent and can just squirt some water and olive + mct oil into to make breakfast?",1764884119.0,4,11,keto,diet

Went to dentist today for regular checkup.  They said I had no plaque or tartar.  The cleaner grabbed the dentist, because she was shocked about the tartar and the dramatic improvement in my gums.

My total cholesterol is high, which I knew would be, but the breakdown was not what I expected. My ratio is much worse, the small and medium particle LDL is high, the large is low, my Apo B is also really high.

I was eating ""clean"" but a lot of my fat was coming from saturated sources such as butter, cream, and animal fat. I read that some people struggle with these so I'm cutting milk fat entirely and limiting saturated fat overall.

My plan for the time being is to back off of keto while maintaining low carb, low glycemic, high fat; something similar to Mediterranean to help me balance out all of the LDL. I'm eating a lot more fiber to pull some this cholesterol, and adding more fatty fish and olive oil. I'll retest in the next 2-3 months.

One thing that I tried as an alternative to meds a few months ago is the mitochondrial diet, not sure it’s as known/set in stone as keto but technically is eating to heal the gut and achieve mitochondrial health in  attempt to see if this diminishes some depressive symptoms in case they were caused by inflammation flare up. Now that I’m being introduced to keto I realize it was quite similar but I was allowed a cup of lentils or chickpeas per day if I wanted or 2 tablespoons hummus and occasionally once a week a sweet potato or some black rice. The rest is mostly fish, chicken 3 times per week and meat once per week, no dairy so I couldn’t have cheese and replaced it mostly with coconut yogurt and soy milk. Collagen bovine powder in morning or pea protein. Cooking with coco oil or ghee only, olive oil as add up and as much as possible organic produce. Nuts allowed to two servings, and veggies were mostly dark leafy ones (I had to eat a lot of them) and fruits = berries and occasional banana (and pineapple or mangoes). I was taking supplements along to help with digestion. I would also have 30g of 70% dark chocolate (no additives apart from coco sugar) a day. Now that I think of it, for the one month when I was very strict with it, I did feel way more energized than any other time in my life.

37 yrs old dad of two very young daughters. I work as a longshoreman, but I kinda landed there to be able to feed the family.

In the last year alone, I went through heavy-weight driving licenses, firearm licence, hunting license, I learned to Autoclave a whooooole bunch of stuff, basically 10x my cooking skills, am going through a massive bushcrafting and homesteading vibe, and through all of this, I’ve become more self aware.. aware of the probably 100 pounds I’m packing in extra, aware of the daily struggle of staying awake after lunch, staying awake driving my car, having enough energy to play with my daughters in the evening, keeping a good attitude daily, staying motivated, and being a good husband to my devoted wife.

I’m sick of being the fat dad of the lot. I dont even drink or smoke or do drugs, I just eat my stress away, **a lot**, and my wife and daughters’ favorite food are bread, cheese, and fruits, so these are permanent features of the kitchen.

Now I’ve talked a bit about wanting to return to our roots, through a keto diet, and my wife brushes it aside as yet another one of my endeavors, but I just can’t get this out of my head..

1pd6hkf,Keto results after 6 months,"Hey all,

I posted here a couple of months ago on being diagnosed with NAFLD and a hba1c of 6.9. I went into panic mode since I never had my hba1c go beyond 6 and all my vitals were near normal except my blood pressure (which has always been high and I was hesitant to take any medicinea for that alone) and high cholesterol. I also happen to have anxiety and panic attacks recently following recent personal circumstances. 

I researched about ways to reverse my NAFLD and hba1c level inorder to avoid going into full blown diabetes and learnt about keto diet and that it could help. So I started keto/low carb diet this July and my weight was 108 kilos. After a couple of months on almost strict diet, I went back to the labs and my results were astounding,

 - my weight dropped a whopping 18 kilos in 4 months
- my hba1c dropped from 6.9 to 5.6 (no longer diabetic or pre-diabetic)
- my scan and blood work no longer point to nafld
- my cholesterol level dropped from high to borderline high
- my blood pressure is still on the high side (around 140/90 range on average). I've read that it might take some time for the blood pressure readings to come down

Thought of sharing the results with you all as the forum has been a lot supportive when I started on this journey and my update might help someone who is thinking of going on a low carb diet. I am still not sure how keto is safe on a long run but a low carb diet appears to work for me ( I am on a low carb moderate protein and moderate fat diet now with a good amount of fiber diet).

I am planning to continue this diet long term for health reasons and hopefully my cholesterol level comes around and my blood pressure returns to acceptable level.

I just wonder if a keto/low carb diet would help my anxiety and I truly hope it does and even if it does not this diet has helped me a lot. Hopefully, I can continue on this diet and continue reaping benefits without major dramas.

Thanks again to everyone who helped me on this journey and my best wishes to anyone who is currently thinking of starting their journey with this diet!",1764774041.0,32,11,keto,diet

Not that it would help put me into ketosis yet, but just to get used to not having certain foods satisfy cravings like bread, rice, treats etc. Is it a usual thing for people to eat a keto diet without counting anything until they are used to only those foods and then they start counting the grams after a few weeks?

I typically eat 50 grams of protein and fat, 3 times a day, spaced at 3-4 hours, and at the end of the day I have and additional 50 grams of fat via heavy cream.

I am stuck at about 20-30 pounds hanging mostly around my belly. 

When I do prolonged water fasts I will lose about 3 pounds a day and my belly will go down significantly, only to creep back up over the next week. I realize a lot of it is water weight but about half is fat loss

But yesterday I did a minimal fat fast (500 calories) and lost 5 pounds.

So I am wondering if maybe I am doing something wrong with my normal eating, or if cortisol or insulin resistance might be at play.

I thought I'd do better with paleo since most treats I like are paleo anyways, but most foods allowed in paleo are what cause me problems and I think that I'd get frustrated following it. Maybe I should find a balance between keto and paleo somewhere in the middle?  I don't want to give up raw dairy and paleo allows no dairy. 
I need to lose weight and I need to stop being bloated, but will a teaspoon of honey or two really stop that from happening ? 
I already eat so clean and I don't have sugar cravings. But when I don't have honey the cravings do start. I just don't want to let go on something that I absolutely love, especially on a diet I think I could do for years.  

But will having the honey make it zero point of being keto??? Will it ruin progress every single day??? 

I just need to cleanse myself from carbs from being vegan for 10 years. 😭 I am no longer vegan after 1 year, but I still need to change my diet drastically just because every time I have a heavy carb I feel sick. Everything makes me bloated because veganism messed up my gut. 

 and even when I was vegan I didn't give up honey, and honey isn't even vegan. That's how much I love it. ",1764661226.0,0,45,keto,diet
1pc1gnb,"Dirty Keto vs ""Natural"" keto","Hello all, 

  
I have done (dirty) keto in the past with great success however I took a journey into WFPB, simple CICO, Vegan for a week (lol), and then back to being fat and unhealthy again. 

  
The problem I have with some variants of Keto is the recommendations to eat pork rinds, globs of fats, and other seemingly super unhealthy suggestions because it fits the no carbs guidelines of this diet. This might get a lot of downvotes and I am sure some people have had success but it would be really interested in understanding your Keto journey and what you were doing before Keto. Obviously going from McDonalds 3 times a day to eating mostly home cooked meals and being conscious of your diet could still be beneficial even with the suggestions to drink bacon grease. 

  
Just to be clear, I am all for the Keto diet. I just think fats should be more naturally ingested. Like for example, fats on a cut of meat or throwing some butter/oils in a dish. Not some fat bomb recipe.

1pbqj61,Cured Anxiety Instantly,"I always had background anxiety my whole life. Sometimes as an adult it got intense, and when I was younger it was like extremely intense at times to the point of having anxiety attacks  
  
I learned to live with it - it wasn't crippling or anything by any means. I tried SSRIs multiple times and eventually came off of them. They sort of helped but generally have really bad side effects.   
  
More recently I had been having some anxiety that was just sort of annoying and something I lived with but I pretty much gave up on ever finding any way to fix it and that was OK. 

I just recently decided to start the keto diet mainly b/c people say it helps a lot with focus, and some podcasts really convinced me it might be worth trying. Maybe there would be some big benefit maybe not.   
  
I was already in really good shape but would eat high carbs some meals a couple times a week. So I just switched my meals for similar but instead of carbs more veggies I basically entered keto within a couple days which was lucky.   
  
What's crazy is I don't feel anxiety at all now, in the same way at least. There's no intense discomfort in the background of my mind that I have hanging over me that I have basically had since I was a kid non stop. I still feel stress but it's like a much more like ""OK I need to do something"" rather than this anxious to my core, world is ending type feeling.   
  
Which is really crazy - b/c I have never been free of it my whole life. I didn't really expect this affect, I moreso just wanted more stable energy levels and better focus. Hoping this effect remains or even gets better as my body / brain adapt over time. Also have had less cravings of any kind (including any indulgent behavior, video games, etc).

I have been keto for almost 2 years, staying under 30 total carbs on most days. I have always had a major sweet tooth, but in trying to make the things I like into low carb or keto versions, or finding things that I like that are within macros, I’ve discovered I can’t stand the taste of sugar substitutes (or almond or coconut flour for that matter). It burns my throat or it’s bitter and I just don’t find that it satisfies the craving. I love baking and baked goods and it seems like no one wants to eat anything with these substitutes in them either. 

I grew up in a “little treat after dinner” kind of family and while I’m pretty effectively able to cut out a lot of stuff I used to love (potatoes, bread, etc.), sugar or a little treat is hard to leave behind. Does anyone have suggestions on how to curb this? Maybe it’s the little treat mentality or just something that isn’t fake sugar that will help. I don’t foresee this craving ever abandoning me.

1pbjudr,10 years keto: my story,"It was somewhere in December 2015, and my weight had reached a ridiculous level. I like to say 300lbs, but the truth is that I only started weighing myself when I started losing weight, so who knows how high it actually went at its peak. I also felt like absolute crap. IBS symptoms, constant fatigue, heartburn *so bad* that I kept a separate bottle of tums at home, in my office desk, and in my car (for emergencies). 

I'd been eating a diet based on fast/processed food for a while since I could afford it, but to be fair, a lot of the weight gain happened on something like a standard diet (Shooting past 260lbs in 2012, for example). Lots of sugar throughout my 20s. Addicted to soda so completely that I woke up shaky until I got my morning fix. Milkshakes were a staple. 

Anyway, some pretty fucked symptoms in winter (it's always winter!) made me decide that enough was enough and I was going to get my health back on track. I wasn't concerned about my weight (didn't even have a concept of it really), I just wanted to feel better.

I didn't know anything about keto at the time, or low-carb. ""Atkins"" was that dude who ate a bunch of bacon and died from a heart attack -- known somewhere in the back of my mind, but not present here. I did, however, understand that my sugar intake was bad, that staple starches made me feel the worst and vegetables made me feel pretty good. I've also never liked legumes. 

So, one decade ago, I started keto by accident. My diet looked like this: 

* Cut sugar out completely.

* Replaced ""staple starches"" with vegetables, which ended up being things I now recognize as *very* low-carb variants -- leaves (cooked or raw), green bell peppers, cucumber, etc.

* No beans/peas/lentils because I didn't like them.

* Meat cooked in butter or oil, predominantly fish -- I was way too lazy to cook my own, but I had a huge disposable income at the time so there were local buffets that offered this, along with the vetetables. I ""knew"" fat was bad and just assumed this was straight protein.

* Greek yogurt, with nuts/seeds mixed in. This seemed like something that just *was* healthy.

* Some fruit, which *also* ended up being low-carb -- strawberries and raspberries.

* A protein shake for breakfast, which ended up being low-carb.

This looks pretty similar to a ketogenic diet plan, but as mentioned, I had no idea what one of those was. By an absurd set of coincidences, I'd stumbled into one on my own.

Within three days, I felt the best I ever had *in my life*. I had so much energy that I rocked back and forth on my feet while waiting in line -- which was absurd, given my weight. Physical ailments had disappeared. The biggest change, though, was mental. I'd been living with brain fog that I *didn't know I had*, and suddenly I had more focus and mental clarity than I knew what to do with. 

And then keto flu hit. 

I ""knew"" that fat as bad (evidently not what contained it though!). I also ""knew"" that sodium should be reduced as much as possible, so after a few days, though potassium and magnesium were definitely in check, sodium *wasn't* and my mental clarity reversed. Brain fog even by 2015 standards, lightheadedness close to syncope. 

It got so bad that I drove myself to the emergency room. Before I entered it though, I talked to a friend about it. A few years back, he had eaten a diet based on ""fish and salads"" and had had the same experience. He convinced me to go buy a greasy burger so I went out, loaded my body up with carbs and salt and felt instantly better.

For about a year afterwards, it was more of a balance down in <100g LCHF ranges. My ridiculous high-energy diet when I could, and SAD when the symptoms got terrible. The weight was falling off, and though I didn't care about that sort of thing, my family took notice.

Around this time I talked to a friend about it and she mentioned that it sounded a lot like ""LCHF"". Back in the 2010s, Sweden had tried an experiment with this kind of diet and it was even institutionalized to some extent because of its effects on diabetes. I dove into a deep rabbit hole, which eventually led me to lurk here. 

When I learned what ""keto flu"" was, suddenly my experiences made a lot more sense. I raised my sodium and found that I could maintain my high-energy diet for over a week. I was also *very* surprised to find out that increasing my fat intake didn't slow the energy down at all, in fact I had *more* and felt more alert as well. ""Fat isn't bad? *What?*""

**Heavy** research, now. My patrilineal line suffers from heart disease. It's killed quite a few of them outright. I wanted to make sure that I wasn't doing something stupid. I put *thousands* of hours into research -- nutrition science, biochemistry, reading ncbi papers for fun, going down ever-deeper rabbit holes. I started posting some of what I had learned here as well.

Meanwhile, the weight was continuing to melt off. I had to tell my family what I was doing, and during an ""intervention"", they did *not* approve. By that point though, I'd researched so much that I was able to deflect all of their arguments and it just ended in a stalemate.

The years ticked on. I was doing keto *intentionally* now, which at the time meant ""very-high-fat low-protein"", but some blood-sugar issues convinced me that maybe that wasn't the right approach. I still felt better with more fat, but protein was now a goal. In 2018, I had a string of *very* physically active jobs, and was surprised to learn that I didn't need carbs to keep up -- just more calories. I achieved my lowest weight -- 173, and switched over to maintenance, sustaining 177lbs on 200g of protein, 300g of fat, 10-30g of net carbs (that job was nuts). 

In 2019, I tried to get back into the programming industry. Part of that process was building up a portfolio, and I decided to make a kind of ""nutrition tool"" that sifted through a copy of the janky USDA database, allowing you to rank things by micronutrient or ratios or whatever. This was **eye-opening** -- not only was I not getting the nutrient deficiencies the anti-keto messaging suggested at the time, but it looked like I was drastically exceeding the RDA in every single area to boot. I learned that low-carb vegetables are like fruit but higher in nutrition, nuts are like legumes but higher in nutrition, and seeds blew whole grains out of the water. Cheese didn't just taste good -- it was high in calcium, B12, phosphorus and selenium. Eggs and meat were remarkably balanced. Because of that database, there was a fundamental shift in what I knew about nutrition. With the exception of tropical fruit, it looked like the lower in carbs you went in a category, the more nutrition you gained. Vegetables weren't the powerhouse of nutrition that I'd been led to believe, and grains (even whole) were worthless with seeds in the diet.

Outside of my diet, 2019 was a bad year for me. I got incredibly broke, and eggs were 60c per dozen, so I switched to vegetarian keto for about a month before I realized I needed *some* meat in my diet, for whatever reason. 2019 was all kinds of rough, but I looked forwards to 2020 hopefully as a new beginning. But of course you know how this story goes.

I had left my 3500-4000 calorie job in 2019 and was out of work during COVID as well. Despite maintaining strict keto, there was a perfect storm of factors that led to a weight gain of over 80lbs. At 260lbs in 2021, I decided enough was enough. My new diet looked like this:

* A good amount of low-carb vegetables, like before.

* Some meat, ideally lean. Fish, sometimes.

* Some seeds and nuts.

* Eggs

* A lot of mozzarella cheese.

* Sour cream and butter, as added fats. 

I'd noticed that the mozzarella cheese and dairy fats sated a lot more than the oils that had characterized my diet before (*particularly* on the high-calorie one -- lots of mayo kept me from wasting away). Nuts/seeds often had a similar effect. I didn't put the pieces together, but my weight started to trend downwards again.

By 2022, the ""we must intervene on his diet"" perspective of my family had changed to ""please help us get on your diet"". Even with the weight gain, 260 on keto looked a *lot* different than it had on SAD -- way more muscle mass, more even distribution of fat pockets. And my appearance at 177 was still fresh in their minds as well. Everyone had gained weight during COVID, and whatever I was doing was worth it to shed it back off. Friends came to me for advice as well. My uncle and mom both had diabetes, and with some silent pressure from my cheese-loaded salads + a *very* good doctor, my mom switched over to <100g LCHF, which naturally transitioned into a keto she's been on ever since. Not only was her diabetes under control (normal blood sugar numbers on the diet), but a high blood-pressure diagnosis 8 years old was mostly under control as well. Needless to say, the holiday season of 2022 was very low in carbs.

In late 2022, I moved across the country. The friends I was staying with had been doing keto for a while by my urging (one of them was the one who told me what LCHF was all those years ago), and had recently gotten into carnivore. I had gotten out of the obese range, but my weight stalled out at 230 when the oils crept back in (I still didn't put the pieces together), so I decided what the hell and joined them.

My carnivore diet looked like this:

* Meat of all kinds. Ribs, ribeye, steak, chicken, fish (though fatty meat was more common)

* Zero-carb sausage, bacon

* Eggs

* Lots of butter, cheese and cream cheese.

They aimed for two meals per day of this. I could barely manage one, and lost a gigantic amount of weight in the next two months. My energy levels tanked, so I reintroduced vegetables and oil. Then I got another physically active job (3k calories) and kept the weight off.

Fast forward to late 2024 and I quit my job, moved in with my dad (my friends had already moved and being in some weird part of the country by myself wasn't great). Despite being fairly active, my weight crept up again. I tried doing OMAD like I had during carnivore, but my hunger was just too high to sustain it. I figured, well, it has to do with my activity level, not my diet (the fat was like 80% oils at that point). 

A few months ago I moved back in with my friends in yet another weird part of the country. They started up carnivore, so there was lots of sour cream and cream cheese around, so I switched back to my 2021 diet, fell into natural OMAD, and finally put the pieces together. 

The next few months are the quickest I've ever lost weight -- 15lbs down per month. My friends are carnivore, and I'm not, but nonetheless I'm maintaining a healthy BMI *regardless* of my activity level. Lots of muscle mass too (10 years of keto tends to do that). I'm not exactly anti-PUFA (still eat seeds/nuts but they lean monounsaturated), but I know enough now to stay away from the oils.

**Conclusion**

It's been a very long journey. At this point, keto isn't a ""diet"" that I'm ""on"", it's just how I normally eat. I'm used to the mental clarity and robust physical health, only noticing the difference when I step away. If you factor in all the weight loss and regain and reloss, I'm around 90lbs down from where I started -- still pretty good! I've refactored my diet a bunch of times and found what works best for me, and plan to be on this for decades to come.",1764612094.0,46,16,keto,diet

I did Keto for 6 years with great results, and went off it for 3. I'm back on, and this is week 4.  

  
During my first 6 years of keto I had some mornings, especially before working out, where I needed to add a little fat - like butter and coconut oil - to my coffee for energy, and there were many afternoons where I would have a little fat (100-200 calories) instead of a large lunch (500-900 calories), so I could make it through the afternoon and not have a large meal until dinner.

  
Unfortunately I've determined with my doctor that saturated fats are definitely raising my bad cholesterol. That's on keto and off. So, I can't use butter and coconut oil as an energy boost, or afternoon meal replacement. They were great weight loss tools, and great for cardio though.

  
Has anyone tried a different fat in the morning or afternoons, for the reasons I've listed, and found success? I'm masochistic enough that I can drink horrible tasting coffee, or whatever. So if anyone has tried evoo, or avocado oil, or duck fat, or something, to booster gym and afternoon performance, let me know.

I give my background in [my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1lo847o/one_month_of_keto/) and what prompted me to start a ketogenic diet. My goal here is to share my updates and observations after five months. Hopefully folks here will find what I share helpful.

TL;DR: Lost 4 more pounds, still feeling grateful and I have maintained energy. Took a break for Thanksgiving, but getting back to it. Life is good.

My notes for this month:

* Down 4 pounds to 204:
   * Weight loss has leveled off.  Still at an apparent 500 calorie a day deficit, but it's harder to keep that now that my calories a day to maintain weight loss has merged with the ""amount I want to eat a day, keto or not"" of calories.  Still, I'm staying on track.
* Thanksgiving
   * Took the holiday ""off"" of keto.  Didn't go wild, but ate enough carbs to go out of keto.  Worth it to me and going right back to keto after.  Wondering how others navigate the holidays.
* Exercise
   * Staying on the pushup, body-weight squats routine.  Up to 5 sets of 8 pushups, (last set to failure) and 5 sets of 20 body weight squats 3x per week.  Getting in steps as I can.
* The Doctor
   * Got my numbers checked by the doctor this month. ALL my levels were good. That was a big deal for me as I'd have something (triglycerides/blood pressure/A1c/etc) out of the normal range last few checks.  That's really good news and has me keeping at it in spite of a holiday interruption.

1pahj70,Would substituting dairy milk for almond milk in my daily latte make a significant difference to weight loss?,"I need a large latte every morning and so I need to choose a type of milk. Either whole dairy milk or regular, commercial (i.e. sweetened) almond milk.

Almond milk has a lot less calories and carbs than dairy milk but it's also sweetened with refined sugar as opposite to the natural sugar (lactose) in dairy milk. 

Also almond milk has A LOT less protein than dairy milk, which has implications for satiety and retaining muscle (also it's more expensive).

Could it also be that I wouldn't notice a tangible difference on my weight loss between using one or the other?

As a note im not on the super strict <25g a day type keto, more like low carb with the occasional day of full-blown keto.

I tried Keto about 5 years ago and almost passed out on the court 3 days into the regiment. Never had that happen before ... hot day, but pretty common conditions for my area. Had a big drop in blood pressure and it was a little scary. I had a workout coach tell me that keto can be very dehydrating. I'm also on a very low dose of lisinophril, which has a water pill component to it as it helps with my asthma. But the water component also can make me dehydrate even more. 

Obviously I need to drink a lot of water , half my body weight in ounces, I've heard. I have an  electrolyte powder called LMNT that I'm going to start drinking once a day. I sweat a lot when I play tennis and I lose a lot of salt --my visor is a testament to that. I'm hoping LMNT will help.

At the same time, pinned to the mantle/wall was the stocking.  When you are 6 years old, the stocking is at best an after thought.  Typically it was socks and underwear and IT'S CHRISTMAS SO WHY IS SANTA GIVING ME SOCKS AND UNDERWEAR!!!!!!!       

Jump skip to today.  As an adult, the stocking stuffer is an AWESOME present!!! Oh, it's still socks and underwear, but at some point, socks and underwear became an awesome present.  Welcome to being an adult.  I'm so old Geritol is about to be my stocking stuffer.  FREEDOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     

We have created this super duper thread so we can all share our ""fun"" victories this week.  NOT the big scale victories, but the fun little victories.  Why do we need to share these victories?  Because pretty soon, you will learn that the small victories--the stocking stuffer victories--are the ones that keep you fired up.      

Every Sunday.  A chance for you to shout above the rooftops of the world the things that improved for you this week by eating a ketogenic diet.

1paamkj,How can you stick to below 20 carbs/day?,"Hello,

I’m into my second month of keto but only started counting my calories and macros around two weeks ago. 
I find it nearly impossible to hit the carb limit. I’ve been averaging around 30 net carbs/day but have had a few days where it’s been around 60 carbs/day, kicking me out of ketosis. Boo. 
I’m only eating meat, fish, veggies, nuts, dairy, oils, eggs. For sweets, I eat erythritol chocolates or min. 90 percent dark chocolate and protein powder first thing in the morning. 
For example, if I eat a soup with meatballs and veggies, boom, that’s 15 grams of carbs right there. If I eat a bowl of pistachios, boom, 12 grams of carbs. 2 tbsp of crunchy peanut butter, yep, 8 grams of carbs. 
Is the only way to stick to “clean” keto to eat a carnivore diet? (Only animal products) and no dairy?
What tips do you have to keep your carbs in check?

Loving the keto journey by the way, I feel like for the first time in my life I am able to keep my sugar addiction under control, without effort or cravings. Thet’s why I started keto in the first place. ",1764481632.0,41,158,keto,diet
1pa5uyi,What am I doing wrong here?  Am I expecting too much?,"I am six weeks into a strict keto diet.  I am hoping that this diet will help me with brain fog, concentration and severe chronic migraine, which I see a neurologist for.

I thought keto might assist with these, because I used to do intermittent fasting until recently.  This was two full fasting days during any 7 day week.  I noticed that on these days and the day after, I had a significant improvement in my brain fog and migraine.

Since I only get a couple days benefit from IF, as I obviously cannot fast 7 days a week, I decided to swap IF for keto to see if that would help.  The neuro said there's some evidence that it might help but no-one has really done the large studies required to say either way.  The doc is also concerned that my use of IF to deal with brain fog and migraines won't be safe as I get older.

I am now six weeks in, and I haven't really noticed anything except a drop in fluid retention (which can happen whenever you change a diet routine, regardless of what it is).

Ketostix, which I have some **serious** questions about in terms of reliability, said I was in ketotis by the afternoon of day 1, and at 16mmol/L of ketones on day 2, and I more or less stayed that at 16 for the first 7 days.  I stopped testing after that because I was told urine tests drop in reliability after that time.  I figured that if I knew for a fact I was eating less than 20g of carbs a day, I was in ketosis so there was no need to get a blood meter, right?

I also go to the gym three times a week for strength training and I run or bike once a week.

Six weeks into keto, I've not noticed anything remotely similar to the dramatic improvement in my symptoms that IF triggers.  The only thing I've noticed is a reduction in fluid retention.  Nothing else - no reduction in brain fog, weight loss (don't need this anyway), ketone breath, urine changes, dry mouth, appetite changes.  Nothing.  I am well hydrated and I have a lot of electrolytes.  

Now the lack of fluid retention is great, because I do get this really badly in my face and eyes each morning.  However that one thing (also solved by a bag of frozen peas to the face for a few minutes) isn't enough to follow such a strict diet which does have negative side effects on cholesterol.

What is going on here?  Is ketosis just completely ineffective for me?  I read what people say in this group and there is so much positive feedback, yet it's just a total zero for me.

I am also female and extremely small, I also am very fit so have a low body fat percentage.  Could this mean that 20g of carbs is still too much for me?  Yet, the ketostix said I was in deep ketosis...

1p9q7is,My timeline on Keto and requesting pointers.,"Im M28 I started keto on 9/21. I have been wanting to start for a long time since I heard all the mental health benefits and watch big name podcasts and listened to success stories which motivated me to start. It’s been about 2 months so far. I started at 263 and now I’m 254. Haven’t lost any muscle since I go to the gym everyday. Most days I am not even sure If I am in Keto. On particular days, I noticed I had foul breath-keto breath and other days my sweat would smell fruity or like sweet onion. First thing that happened to me was intense brain fog and irritability like in the first week.

Week 2 to 6 is where my body and mind started changing so quick and I experienced amazing focus, clear mind, amazing sleep(which I was super grateful for since I struggled with sleep for so many years), high libido, and other benefits.

Week 6 is where I started getting brain fog again and irritated easily. I did some research and found out that my body was starving for electrolytes. I use 1 packet of lmnt now and 2 packets on heavy workout days. 

Now it’s week 8 and my sleep is alright, but I don’t feel the urge to sleep around 10 pm anymore. My nervous system is super sensitive so even a little caffeine can keep me awake. Libido has also significantly reduced and dont get morning wood either. I wonder if that is related to no fap because it’s day 32 of no fap for me now.

Im sure I have not even been in ketosis for long periods of time since I would eat high carb foods once in a while. One particular drink that I am struggling to cut is international delight caramel coffee creamer- it’s just so good with my coffee.

The least I go in daily carb in take is 30g. The highest I go is 70g. I have 39% fat and over 60 pounds in lean mass. Yeah Im muscular, but most of is hidden under fat and I would like to continue keto and lose about 35 more pounds minimum. I would love some tips on supplements and other habits that can help me in my keto journey

1p9pk6q,Did keto help you with depersonalization/derealization/brain fog? Desperate for something to help,"I've watched some videos about keto for mental health, podcasts with Dr Chris Palmer about keto treating all sorts of mental disorders and symptoms was really promising. I've dealt with this for so long and it feels like...it's coming from my body, because it flares up when I eat a lot of processed carbs, when I'm low on nutrients etc. 

It's really messed up my life as I constantly feel unreal, in a dream, and don't feel like myself, it's like someone has replaced me inside and I just have to act out the motions of me - it's horrible, deeply depressing and has impacted everything I do, the way I socialise and connect, my motivation and energy and drive. 

The brain fog is also crazy bad sometimes - it makes me slow, easily confused, it makes me feel stupid and unable to express myself properly because complex ideas are just hard to verbalise.

1p9o1fr,Did anyone else feel nervous moving into Maintanence?,"53F 5’ 2” 130 lbs from 156 lbs!!! I’ve managed to reach my goal weight this week and I’m so pleased. I’ve done it slow and steady so it’s taken me about 11 months . It feels quite something to have lost 26lbs and I just feel so much more comfortable in myself although still a bit anxious at ageing and changes (hello body dysmorphia ). The only thing is I have to be very careful because I have a history of disordered eating . So food can be a pleasure and also a tool for me use for control . I did keto to help with many other issues : neurodivergent challenges (I’m AuDHD but not allowed medication due to medical issues), weight loss, suspected pre-diabetes, chronic illness, and other mental health challenges.. so far it has all really been helped. I’m quite amazed. 

So now I’m at my goal weight. I’m ready to move into Maintanence . I’ve just redone my calculations on the Nutra check app this morning & I’ve got approximately extra 200-300 more calories a day! 

Daily the last year has been 1457. 

My easy day Saturday was 1997 (I never really reached that and only maybe got to 1500 to 1600 because it just felt too much food I’d bloat - hello bowel disease and IBS)! 

With the recalculation today I’ve now got 1678 (& easy day is Saturday which is over 2000)!!! 

Im not sure I’m going to get to that amount at all . It just feels like too much food for me on my small frame!! This all feels a bit scary & surreal as I’m so used to eating under 1500 for years (albeit with very high carb, which is probably why I had to go to Keto because I suspected I was becoming pre-diabetic because I just wasn’t losing and in fact, swelling up everywhere). I mean, I’m glad I can just relax a little bit but I’m feeling a lot of apprehension and trepidation today moving into this part. 

Anyone have any wise words and support to manage the fear?! 

Edited to add, I will of course keep my carbs  anywhere between 25 g and 30 g at the most still. ",1764420132.0,9,29,keto,diet

I started my diet 31 OCT. I just had an inbody scan done, and my results are as follows:

Overall weight: 196lbs to 181.2lbs (-14.8lbs)  
Muscle mass (not total lean mass): 88.8lbs to 85.1lbs (-3.7lbs)  
Body fat mass: 36.9lbs to 32.9lbs (-4lbs)  
Body fat %: 19.3% to 18.0%

As mentioned before, I needed to be under 185lbs to meet the HT/WT table requirement for my height and age. The diet has been relatively easy to follow and I haven't struggled with being hungry or anything really to do with the eating portion.

I will 100% confirm that my overall endurance has suffered, but not as much as I thought it might. This goes for muscular and cardiovascular endurance, both.

The date I need to continue to prepare for is 18 DEC. Guess I could have waited until then for an update, but I wanted to share the success because this sub has been so overwhelmingly helpful, inviting, and welcoming to my concerns.

Chromium supplements seem to take a slight edge off, electrolytes help with the general keto feeling and i recently started using ozzi because it has chromium and fiber and is keto friendly. Its kinda expensive so its probably not worth it to everyone but I just need that to keep going, going on pure willpower honestly just makes me miserable.

Has anyone found anything that actually reduces the cravings themselves rather than just relying on willpower.

1p8krh0,Goodbye Cat Allergies,"I’ve been on an off keto on a somewhat seasonal basis for the last 3 years. I eat ketogenic to keep headaches and migraines under control. This is an added benefit I never would’ve imagined!

A few months ago a family member passed away and my partner and I started taking care of the family members cat. For my (33m) whole life, I have been highly allergic to cats. I made sure I was deeply ketogenic (pretty much zero carb) prior to bringing the cat into our home. I had virtually no allergy symptoms. Maybe only 10% of the intensity of the symptoms I normally feel, even holding/petting the cat, definitely exposing myself to a lot of allergens. I’ve cycled on and off keto multiple times in the ~6 weeks we’ve had the cat, specifically to see how my body reacts. Within 1.5 days around 100g carbs/day, my allergies are back with full intensity. This seems to be the case regardless of the carb source. Going back to keto, it takes about 2-3 days until my symptoms are pretty much nonexistent. The closer to carnivore I eat, the less allergy symptoms I have. 

I wanted to share this discovery, and to see if anyone has had a similar experience. I’m not sure of the exact mechanism behind this. Maybe someone has insight into that as well. Less overall inflammation? Minimized immune response?

Now, I know that it can get discouraging when you see posts where people are sharing that they lost weight quickly.  That was not my experience.  Keep in mind that everyBODY is different.  My average weight loss was .69 lbs. per week and many weeks I actually gained weight that I held but then it would drop off.  This is despite NO cheat days and only 1 cheat meal all year (I couldn't refuse 'the world's best coconut cake' when visiting Nashville in September) .  I logged every meal, snack and glass of wine (and will continue to) and minded my macros and calories.  If that is your story also please do not give up!

After 5 days and motivated by this I started a 48hr water fast - which is where it all went tits up. I felt really crap on the second day - big heart palpitations - and the euphoria was gone. I went on a strict keto diet from then on, but had a poor week of sleep due to stress. I was also under eating due to poor diet planing and kept losing weight (-5kg/11lb total since start - I weighed 82kg/180lb before @ 6ft 4 so healthy). I was eating lots of butter, olive oil and mct to keep up the calories and I just felt low energy and unhealthy, like the fat was clogging my arteries. Toward the end I was chugging loads of extra electrolytes, salt and upped my magnesium.

I’m just trying to figure out what was the culprit for it going wrong? As soon as I had carbs I started feeling better too.

A) lack of sleep (I was very sleep deprived/stressed on the second week) 
B) extended keto flu / poor electrolytes

Looking for some practical advice on OMAD

I (22M, 180cm, 85kg, active lifestyle) had done a keto diet for a month before to get rid of my sugar cravings. At that time I was fairly comfortable to do OMAD for lunch, because I used to eat a lot of animal fats, that I like so much. 
Since I came to study to the country of the rising sun I have noticed that people here eat a lot of rice and that I tend to do it too... even excessively, despite the fact that I do good exercise everyday, so I decided to go keto again, because 2 bowls of rice everyday is not good for me. 
Now here is the question: I'm a student and bringing my own food everyday to school is little bit bothersome for me. So at the moment I am a week in, eating OMAD for breakfast, during day and evening I am energetic. But I noticed that people who  do IF tend to skip breakfast, because in the morning they have enough energy, and do their meal once for lunch, is there any good reason for skipping breakfast?

I've been doing keto for nearly 3 years with astounding success. Lost 110lbs/51kg, ditched the cpap, and T2 is in remission. I'm now mantaining my weight.

I never had keto flu, never had carb cravings, easily do 16/8, basically, it's been great. 

So, the other day I made beef jerky (no sugar, of course, so very low carb) and it was great. I also had major insomnia that night, and at 2:00 am, dug into that beef jerky like the old days of uncontrollable eating. For the first time in 3 years, I ate with no stops. Afterwards, I calculated the damage, and figured I ate 209g of protein that day and 2200 calories. My average daily protein intake over the past year has been 73g, and 1350 calories.

I felt SO ill the next day. Not nauseous, but gross. I had absolutely no appetite and ended up spontaneously fasting for the next 36 hours (I see this as a good thing). I wish I had thought to check my blood sugar, but I didn't. Now, 3 days later, my appetite is still very low (again, a good thing), and my blood sugar is well within the normal range.

30M here. 

I’ve had fatigue issues as long as I can remember. Went to see a doctor, he did basic blood tests and declared it “is all in my head” (he’s since lost his job, 
 - fuck you, doc).

I’ve noticed that whenever I manage to get into ketosis > 0.5, it’s like someone turns the lights on in my brain. I can think more clearly, I am less tired, and more capable. 

Whenever I fall out of ketosis I am extremely exhausted. I feel like my eyes are heavy, I can’t think, I can’t remember words or names. I have been terrified of losing my job because of this. 

Has anybody else experienced this? I’ve done keto on and off for years, so I’m going to assume this isn’t something that’s going to change. I hate feeling like I have to do keto for the rest of my life; I’m single and it makes dating and socialising awkward. 

I’ve also started playing ice hockey and I’m terrified of the impacts that keto will have on my ability to perform. I’m not that fit and find myself winded even when I do eat carbs. I was planning on doing TKD for this in the long term as hockey is very high intensity. 

I appreciate any experiences that anybody has, good or bad. I just want to feel like a normal human being who can do a days work without needing to lie down after 2 hours. ",1763921342.0,22,28,keto,diet

I have been advised to consider a keto diet for my son (12)  with epilepsy, I am already consulting with his neurology team and have an appointment scheduled with a pediatric dietitian. However, I’m hoping to connect with anyone else that has experience with this situation! I read there are growth concerns for kids on a keto diet so I would also like to ensure I can do this in a way to minimize any adverse outcomes 😊 we will likely make this diet change as a family so he doesn’t feel alienated, but will of course keep healthy carbohydrate sources for the other kids in the family.

1p4i34t,[2025-11-23] - [Stocking Stuffer Sunday] – Fun Keto Victories,"Hello r/keto!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

When you are a kid, the big present under the tree was ALL THAT MATTERED!!!!  It captivated our imagination for hours upon hours.  Is it a new Big Wheel?  A huge train set?  Maybe even a new bicycle that we can put together.  Christmas day, we attacked that present like that bear would attack those 100 dudes--with total carnage.  At the same time, pinned to the mantle/wall was the stocking.  When you are 6 years old, the stocking is at best an after thought.  Typically it was socks and underwear and IT'S CHRISTMAS SO WHY IS SANTA GIVING ME SOCKS AND UNDERWEAR!!!!!!!       

Jump skip to today.  As an adult, the stocking stuffer is an AWESOME present!!! Oh, it's still socks and underwear, but at some point, socks and underwear became an awesome present.  Welcome to being an adult.  I'm so old Geritol is about to be my stocking stuffer.  FREEDOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     

We have created this super duper thread so we can all share our ""fun"" victories this week.  NOT the big scale victories, but the fun little victories.  Why do we need to share these victories?  Because pretty soon, you will learn that the small victories--the stocking stuffer victories--are the ones that keep you fired up.      

Every Sunday.  A chance for you to shout above the rooftops of the world the things that improved for you this week by eating a ketogenic diet.

1p472aj,Keto + PTSD successes and challenges,"Hello everyone,

F, 32 years old, 1m63, 61kg.

I started keto at the beginning of October. It happened intuitively: I reduced the carbohydrates in the hope of losing the kilos that I gained in recent months because of my anti-depressants (I gained 8/9 kilos on brintellix). I take these medications to relieve my symptoms of post-traumatic stress. To date, I have only lost 0.5kg 😂. I have never had such a capricious metabolism in my life!

But from the first days on a ketogenic diet: I felt incredible well-being. Reduction of stress and fear; at a level never experienced since my trauma. Improved my sleep. Disappearance of my tremors. Improvement in agoraphobia. Mental slowing down. Clarity. Stable energy. No more sweet compulsions (due to medication)...

Wow! The miracle. So I found out, I discovered metabolic psychiatry, everything is explained! I really felt like I was transforming from one day to the next.

All of this gave me confidence and energy to deal with things that were too uncomfortable for me until then. At the beginning of November I travel for a week to find new accommodation and pick up my things from my old job. In short, a stressful week for me: travel + socialization. I'm getting through this week, keeping my ketogenic diet.

But the following week, I have irresistible cravings for whipped cream. I tell myself “ok my period is supposed to start in a few days, give your body what it demands! "". I work a lot like this: by listening to my body rather than precisely counting what I consume. My period never came. I ate whipped cream for 5 days hahaha. I ended up understanding that maybe I didn't have pre-menstrual symptoms but rather a repercussion of my stressful week!

Two weeks later: I'm still experiencing this aftershock. Intense fatigue, stress, difficult to unblock emotions, hungry all the time 😭 I definitely feel like I'm out of ketosis. I am currently at 20, 30 or 40g max of carbohydrates per day. I have trouble controlling myself. Every evening I say to myself “come tomorrow you stay well under 20g! "". But I fail. Not by much but okay.

My stress is still high. It takes a long time for it to come down…. Post-traumatic stress is complex. I try to be patient. And at the same time I know that ketosis would help me! It was so easy the first weeks: I had no slippage, no sugar cravings, and above all a naturally reduced appetite. I was zen! I can't find this. 

What I'm feeling right now is that it's difficult for me to get into ketosis while I'm in a high stress state. Has anyone ever felt this way?

So I wanted to share my journey with you. You can guess that I want to continue keto for mental health reasons now. This diet brings me well-being that I have never experienced with medication. It's happiness. I hope to return to the state I experienced in October. And in the meantime, I'm listening if any of you have knowledge of the link between stress and entering ketosis. 

Thank you everyone, I learn a lot thanks to you!",1763853092.0,12,11,keto,diet

1p3pieo,Day 150. Life has and continues to change. Down 50lbs,"Hello all! 

Day 150 of Keto. 

Yesterday was my 37th bday. Male. Starting weight on July 2nd was 282lbs. A1C that day was 6.4. I got the news I was .1 away from a diabetes diagnosis and it scared the shit out of me. Immediately started researching what kind of diet would fit the profile for someone with the tastes of a picky 8 yr old. And Keto was the answer!

First month was RAPID. 21 lbs down. Back at the Drs office, she's thrilled with the progress. Asks me what I've done because she hasn't given me ozempic and this is big weight loss. Dr approves of the diet. Clothes already fit better. The diet feels natural and easy at this point.

Month 2-3 is where I start slowing down. I knew I couldn't keep up the big loss for that long. Had to convince myself it's ok to not see movement every day, this is a long term thing and I needed to start looking at it on a weekly basis. At the 3 month mark, I was down 40lbs! A1C went from 6.4 to 5.1. Doc said that was a ""completely normal"" reading. I had did it! Fought back diabetes, and was losing weight in the process! At the end of month 2, my wife (36) decided she couldn't just watch this happen and not jump on. Her start date was August 22nd at 317lbs. A1C of 6.1. Her joining made this so much easier on me. We donated everything in the house that didn't fit the diet. We researched things together that would. We now were a force at losing this weight, and it was working!

Month 4 was slow for me. A big stall at the beginning of the month. 240-245. Just kept riding between it. And that's when I realized that if I was going to continue to drop lbs, my alcohol drinking had to drastically reduce. And man when it stopped, I really started to feel good. It took a while but then it kicked back off again

Month 5. From 242 to 232. Where I am today. This might be the 1 thing I've done in my life I'm most proud of. 50lbs was something I never thought possible. And certainly not just on a diet with no gym work! My wife is down 46 lbs in 89 days! We will be down 100lbs as a couple by December when we dominate the first holiday here. We plan on a gym membership for the first of the year to start doing some light weight lifting. 

Overall, what an experience. No hunger anymore, clear mind, more energy. Sex drive is elevated for both of us, we look better, feel better, and f*** better. Keto is and has been life changing for both of us. And I'm happy to know this will give us the best shot to grow old together. Thanks for everyone's posts here. Although I only lurk the sub, it's nice to read others stories and successes.",1763805429.0,394,25,keto,diet

1p3dzys,Help with post traumatic osteoarthritis,"Hey all. I've seen some posts and comments claiming big benefits in pain caused by various types of arthritis and other inflammitory/autoimmune disorders. But I'm wondering who has had success dealing with pain/limitations from post traumatic or regular osteoarthritis.

I'm 27m and had a bad knee injury at 17. My knee has worked fine for the last 10 years despite being lose and missing some tissue, but recently has started telling me to slow down at work, which isn't ideal (I'm trying to get a painting company off the ground) I've started physio therapy, and am in the process of getting scheduled for a ligament reconstruction and will ask if theres anything else they can do to help, but I understand there's likely not much that can be done surgically and know that I'm far too young, and still working too well to consider a joint replacement. Ideally I'd like to hold that off for a few decades at least. 

Has keto helped with your osteoarthritis? Especially if your arthritis is the result of a prior injury.

1p38fha,"Keto Long-Term? Looking for Advice With PCOS, Insulin Resistance & Food Intolerances","A bit about me: I’ve seen so many doctors, specialists, nutritionists, and functional medicine practitioners over the years. Each one has helped in different ways, but I still struggle to find someone who can give me clear, consistent guidance on what kind of diet is actually best for my conditions.

I have lean PCOS (since childhood), long COVID, post-concussive syndrome, insulin resistance, an MTHFR mutation, hypoglycemia, hypothyroidism, and I was subclinical Hashimoto’s... though I reversed that last time I checked. Basically, I’ve really been through it.

A few years ago I unintentionally ended up eating keto because I couldn’t tolerate most foods. At this point, I feel like I have a decent handle on my health. Even on bad days, my baseline is pretty stable and I bounce back quickly. Recent labs have looked rather good too.

***My question is:*** *how safe is it to stay on keto long-term? I’ve seen mixed information.*

I can’t tolerate breads, potatoes, pastas, or most grains (especially rice). I usually stick to cauliflower instead of rice, sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes, and usually skip anything in a package, but sometimes I will do cassava noodles as a noodle alternative. I nearly avoid all processed foods, buy my meat from a local farm, and stick to fresh, seasonal produce. But I do have some cheat days, with ice cream or other treats. (I try to stick to the 80/20 rule).

Please be kind, as I am learning! Being in the U.S. healthcare system is overwhelming and expensive, as I am sure some of you are aware. I know this isn’t medical advice; I’m just looking for general guidance. Thank you!",1763754590.0,9,27,keto,diet

Im F35 h 171cm  , doing mostly clean keto. Fast the 16/8 rule but usually my fast is longer.  I ve PCOS . Im going almost everyday on a hike around 2 hours.
Supplements i take are
 ovasitol twice a day for my pcos, 
Organika electrolytes in the morning before food.
Zinc with first meal 
D3 with first meal
Pumpkin seed oil at dinner
Magnesium bisglycinate before bed.
Oh calories intake around 1300 usually with refeed days around 1500 rarely 1800 calories.
 
Macros I ashamed get calculated by AI but I do sorta check it they seem okay. Usually protein is around 100 fat around 80 carbs varies but mostly under 20 and with outlier under 30

Besides me feeling my weightloss has been stalled or moving  very little ( 3ish weeks  on around 94-95)

But now I've been feeling super weak and dizzy and nauseous,  not it wasn't  keto flu this was something entirely else. 

Anyway a discussion between me my know it all husband and self appointed keto guru mother. We all came to an agreement that it sounds like I have a way too low blood sugar.

Im (33f) an ectomorph, 174cm and 55kg with a very fast metabolism. I am currently eating high fats, moderate protein and still mainly high carbs (from veggies). I have a lot of health issues (IBS, Eczema, Graves, Lichen Sclerosus).

1p208jf,Day 13 - Am i doing it right!,"Hi... this may be a long post - this post will be asking for advice on ketosis and ketones.

So i started my keto journey properly about 13 days ago, I'm doing it for mental health purposes. I have tried numerous diets, cutting out food intolerances and fasts over the years and by far the ketosis lifestyle is having the best results by far.

The main reason to reach out and speak to this community is because i have become too reliant on chatGPT (i know i know!) the guide me on my keto journey and basically I've awoke from the AI illusion and what some advice from real people and tips.

So here we go...

im on day 13 today... I've woke up with a ketone reading of around 1-1.2nmol ketones in my urine - how im feeling today. Achy, tired, alot of procrastination, and sadness.  
Im wanting to know are these symptoms of the transition from burning glucose to burning fat?  
i have previously done a 12 day bone broth fast, had a little stint on a medium carb diet and then went full keto. Question to you guys is... will i start to feel the full keto benefits soon and will it only get better the longer i stay in keto.



Another question.... My days worth of food looks like this...   

Eggs, tallow, saurkraut for breakfast

High fat minced beef, eggs, tallow and kraut for dinner

and the same again for my tea.

Now this every day, repetitive, I blame my autism for this routine structured food plan!

Eating this way every day... is it ok? im getting supplements (electrolytes, Vit D, NAC, Magnesium and more (got this part boxed off) so i dont think im running low in anything.

Should i introduce some cards... 10g 20g a day? im quite happy not eating carbs as i feel no carbs equals better mental health for me.

  
Thanks for reading.. any input, feedback or tips is appreciated. 

Also doing this to better my diagnosed autism and adhd - i experienced mental peace when i did the bone broth fast with a high ketone reading. i Know now ketones will help me enjoy my life abit more.

1p1d3xd,Guidance - Keto stall ?,"Hello all 29F 4’11 PCOS with IR started at 182 and down to 174 
Have not had significant progress and cannot figure out why. 
Started 15th September! (10 weeks or so) 

I am eating in a calorie deficit at about 1200-1300/day, 90g ish of protein a day give or take, and sticking below 20g net / day. (Often 10-17g) 

I am learning that eating in such a deficit could be causing my body to hold onto weight given that I have pcos, I am doing this for weight loss & I will say that drop is the first time id ever seen a scale move without a glp1. (Started 210-182 came off due to cost and chose to do keto) could artificial sweetener like a Sprite Zero or sugar free sweetener in coffee could be a hold back? 

Now I’ve been told that maybe I need to go back up in calories and maybe do 30g-50g carbs to reset my metabolism and then go back into a 20g net carb, but I’m not sure if that’s accurate. 
I picked up jogging & have been going to the gym to weightlift and I’m wondering what I might be doing wrong. I am not seeing significant changes yet. 

A couple questions:
- if you are past keto flu, do you still need electrolytes? I think I was over supplementing and it was giving my not a good time on toilet. 
- can artificial sweeteners cause problems with weight loss? 
- is a blood monitor more accurate than urine sticks and should I get one? 
- should I come up to reset my metabolism or is that a mistake? 

If anyone else is in here who has had success on pcos, I would love to hear your story. I’ve been on this journey since my diagnosis 3 years ago and I’m so sick of my body being on hard mode all the time. Doctors are useless so I’ve been navigating this pretty much solo. I just want to be happy, healthy & be comfortable in my skin. I am committed to this lifestyle of keto & I am perfectly content doing it long term! ",1763571552.0,6,9,keto,diet
1p1c1iv,My advice to a friend starting keto,"He's in his first week and asked if I had any advice (I've been keto for a year and a half). This was my response and wondered what you all thought:

Congrats first of all!

I don't know if ""advice"" is the right term, but I can let you know the things that helped me. 

1. Above all else, determine what you're doing it for and hold on to that tightly. You will be tempted and you may slip up, but keep focused on that reason and see yourself achieving that goal. 

2. Saying no is the hardest part, but each no gets easier and easier. After saying no to temptations the first week or so is the hardest, but then you start to build up equity and each time you say no it's because you've said it so many times before. So giving it up to a yes, had better be worth it. You also will begin to realize saying no is just as easy as saying yes. The temptation is temporary. The satisfaction of eating a piece of candy is passing. Once you've eaten it then you're right where you were before being tempted. I like to mentally breakdown the temptation and see what I would really be doing by giving in.

3. Prepare for temptations. Plan ahead. Going out for dinner? Look at the menu ahead of time. 

4. Repetition. This was a big one for me, but I don't know if it works for everyone. I'm a creature of habit and like my routines. So for me, I eat the same thing every day. I built my diet to maximize efficiency. I wanted something that kept me in a caloric deficit with as low of a carb count as possible, while maintaining a balance of cost, easy of use, quantity, and taste, I also really want to consume as much protein as possible. So for me I eat a low carb protein bar every weekday morning, low carb wrap for lunch with a pre-portioned chicken salad cup, baby carrots and celery. Then for dinner I have a prepackaged caesar salad with grilled chicken that I cook on Monday's. I just bring all my lunch food into the office at the beginning of the week and make it there that way I don't have to meal prep. Then for dinner I just have to open the salad and add the chicken. 

5. Find replacements. I'm a huge snacker with a really bad sweet tooth. What helped me was finding things that would replace the temptation. Pop? Sparkling water. (This one was huge) Carb heavy chips? Pork Rinds. Mindless snacking? Almonds (these are a godsend for me). If you absolutely have to have sweets, look for the lowest carb option which is usually dark chocolate. 

6. Don't give up. Time will pass and you may not see a difference, then one day someone will off handily say something like ""hey, are you losing weight?"" and then it starts FALLING off. 

7. Be careful not to develop a bad relationship with food. Just like eating too much junk food, you can also go the opposite end and develop bad habits that leave you malnourished and do just as much harm to your body. This is something I constantly struggle with. When I give in (especially around the holidays) I get so down on myself about it. So...try to keep a good head about things.",1763569209.0,31,16,keto,diet
1p1b3s4,Starting keto...,"Hi all. I'm thinking of starting a ketogenic diet. I work nights and want to have more energy during the day so I can train. Also the mental health aspect is obviously a plus. I was in ketosis for a brief time earlier this year, for like a month, but eventually gave up because of cravings. Point is, I know the basics of keto.

I was wondering this time, as hearth problems run trough my family, what is the best way to prepare meat and generally all food? Is it a convection oven with a fan? I'm trying to consume as less bad fat as possible.

Have any of you here done keto for a long period of time? I'm talking 10+ years so you can tell me if you have any health problems like high cholesterol etc...

1p15lly,Fat loss after initial water weight loss,"How long after the initial water weight loss did you start losing fat and how quickly did it come off? I started out at 186 and started with a 36 hour fast 7 days ago and then went into clean Keto.

For reference I am a 5’4 female, GW 135-140 (the way I carry weight any less than that looks unhealthy on me personally especially if I have any muscle mass). 

I lost what I assume is all water weight very quickly and then it all slowed down to 1 oz a day the last few days. At least it’s going in the right direction I guess. I know I just need to stick to it, but hoping to start losing fat soon.

First day, I’m at 0.1.  Very expected and I proceed as planned.  Over the course of the next couple days I got up to 0.4 and then bounced back to 0.3.

I’m super strict - and the whole thing is monitored by a large online company.  They have me consuming 15oz worth of protein (no more than 1 oz coming from nuts) and I’m coming in consistently at less than 30g carbs/day.  

I’m also down 15lbs, and have all the symptoms of keto now (energy, very little appetite, etc)

I’m really trying to figure out if this is normal for some people, or if I should be worried about it at all.  A big part of me says it doesn’t really matter, but the other part is curious if it’s just a matter of sticking to it longer or what exactly gives…

Since I know it does matter, I'm 40m, 5'4"", and about 125 lbs. I lost about 5 lbs by pretty much eliminating sugar, and severely cutting down on carbs. I did lose about 15 lbs in the summer, but that was due to stress before cutting carbs and sugar.

When looking for salts, I didn't find potassium or light salt (it's absurdly uncommon here in Brazil), I only found it on the internet, but it will take a few days to arrive, and I already started the diet today.

So, in order not to go through these same problems, which are already screwing with my head, I have some doubts:

1 - I bought a magnesium chloride supplement, but each tablet has 86mg, I must take N amounts (~4) to reach the 300mg that the FAQ recommends, right? 

2 - Generally my foods have a lot of salt, do you still recommend supplementing, or maybe the foods are already healthy? Or maybe I'm already counting the amount I use in food?)

3 - I'm sorry if the FAQ makes it explicit, but is the amount specified in the FAQ for supplementation in addition to what I already ingest on a daily basis? Or if in total for the day (including food) I already ingest what is specified in the FAQ, would that be enough?

4 - While I can't get the potassium, I intend to drink 1 liter of coconut water a day (I was already doing this before keto), which according to Google has 3000mg of potassium per liter (3x the amount indicated by the FAQ)

5 - How long after the first day of Keto does the flu arrive? (Sorry again if it is already specified in the FAQ hahaha)

1oyzpms,Holiday keto ✨,"I'm at the end of planning my Turkey Day (always limited offerings & super easy, bc I rather binge anime with family on my day off than cook...). I thought it'd be fun to list our holiday favorites, esp as keto my first holidays flummoxed me, but now it's easy peasy

So, without further ado:

1) bought a cooked turkey, did I mention easy?

Usually we get a rotisserie chicken, actually, but I want leftovers for soup and sandwiches this year

2)  Brussels sprouts & green bean/artichoke casserole

3) riced cauliflower with cheese

4) cranberry mandarin sauce, light on the mandarin

5) pumpkin cheesecake pudding

FYI, we get up in the AM, bake pie first thing and binge that anime I mentioned (Frieren and Dungeon Meshi, probably). Don't forget nice coffee, Skinny Syrup, whipped cream, heavy cream 😋

I focus on having really great cheddar to go with the very teeny amount of apple pie I'll have. It's decadent, it's festive, it's family friendly,  it's still keto for me 🧀 That gets the day off to a terrific start!

I don't cook much from scratch on holidays bc i rather enjoy family and being off work, so liberal use of frozen veggies, just add in good spices/flavors, the previously mentioned cheese, creams, coffee, etc ☕ 

I never want to feel deprived of great food or slave over food I  can't eat, so simple really works for us. 

And then we're full and drowsy... 😴 🦃 ",1763333364.0,9,6,keto,diet
1oyzkow,Question About Working Out,"First a little background. After years a dealing bad knees, they became debilitating. Just going to the grocery store would require a day or two to recover. It took 7-8 years, but I went from 6’3 230lbs to 320lbs. During that time not only did I quit working out due to the pain, but almost all activities were just too painful. 

Now I’m getting double knee replacement (not at the same time).  My doctor wanted me to try and lose weight before the surgery and has me on a keto diet. (He says it also greatly increases recovery rates because the diet naturally gets rid of stuff that promotes inflammation.) 

So, in 3 months on keto I’ve lost 35lbs. It’s been easier than I thought. (And this sub has been very helpful!) My knees are still an issue obviously. However, surgery is in a week. Along with physical therapy my doctor says I should get back to working out. (Obviously stuff I can do without inhibiting my knee recovery.) 

Here’s my question: Once I start working out will I lose some of the weight loss momentum? This has happened to me in my younger years, as I gain muscle mass I don’t lose weight. But I’ve never weighed this much and I’m in my late 40s now. So, should I expect to stop losing weight as I get back to working out? ",1763333028.0,6,5,keto,diet

1oyyuqc,Keto cured IBS for 2 weeks?,"I have been going through stomach trouble for almost 2 years now, starting with a lot of bloating and LPR.

   2. GASTRIC BIOPSIES:
   3. Gastric antral mucosa with mild reactive changes.

   2. Anti-Vinculin Ab: 1.61
4. Stool: Candida albicans Abnormal: Light growth

Most gastro's I visited put me on PPI or Pepcid. Both seem to work, but unfortunately have an adverse effect on my existing tinnitus.

My Symptoms: Constipation, Extreme Bloating, LPR, Cramping Lactose Intolerance

I'm currently on Trifala and Motil Pro which have helped my constipation. I've tried various diets including low fermenation and elimination.

On the elimination diet, I was only eating white jasmin rice and chicken breast soup with some light vegetables for the first 2 weeks. Its only when I switched to Keto that my bloating completely went away (within 1 day of starting it).

One of my major issues, which is bloating from drinking water, went away immediately and I was able to drink half a litre of water in one sitting.

Unfortunately I started incorporating other foods: low lactose cheeses, some hot sauce, lettuce, raspberries, dark chocolate while staying under the keto carb limit and the cramping, bloating has come back with a vengeance.

I'll go back to removing this stuff to see how I feel, but for 2 weeks after I started keto, I had never felt better - virtually no bloating, no cramping - lost a bunch of water weight from my stomach which made my clothes fit so much better and reduced the belly pressure! This is ofcourse I started introducing many of the above foods and the cramping returned.

My biggest wonder is how was keto able to resolve my symptoms so quickly - even though my SIBO result is negative. The next step from my naturopath are LDN and motegrity. Any advice, similar experiences are greatly appreciated!",1763331260.0,10,20,keto,diet

1oysctd,Feels like I'm between a rock and a hard place - crazy high LDL-C,"The rock and hard place in question are dysthymia+gut issues, and a high LDL.

Male, 43, 1m75, 69kg (5'.7"", 152lbs). I've been eating keto pretty consistently since 2018, mainly for mental health - I water fasted for two weeks, discovered my dysthymia disappeared, my digestive issues went away, and figured that staying in a well-formed ketogenic diet kept both at bay. I've had some periods of eating carbs (I love Indonesian and Indian food) but generally I then have episodes of mood disorder again, plus digestive issues. No fun. Being in therapeutic or at least nutritional ketosis levels allows me to inhabit my body in a way that is just mentally night and day, and my anxiety and digestive issues are gone as well.

For a while now, relatives have asked me to get my lipids checked since both of them have high LDL-C (200mg/dl or higher). So I finally I bit the bullet and had a panel drawn.

*But I water fasted 5 days beforehand out of interest.*

**HDL**: 0,99 mmol/l / 38.279 mg/dl

**LDL**: 11,6 mmol/l / 448.52 mg/dl

**Trig**: 2,1 mmol/l / 81.197 mg/dl

**Total**: 13,5 mmol/l / 521.98 mg/dl

Naturally my doc freaked out. I explained that I fasted, that I normally eat keto, and she and I decided that I had another panel drawn.

Three weeks later (so 3 weeks of being back on my regular diet), my readings were:

**HDL**: 1,19 mmol/l / 46.012 mg/dl

**LDL**: 9,6 mmol/l / 371.19 mg/dl

**Trig**: 1,9 mmol/l / 73.464 mg/dl

**Total:** 11,6 mmol/l / 448.52 mg/dl

Doctor's assistant: ""What did you **do**?!""

I said ""I stopped fasting"".

Still, my LDL is high so the doc got a liver values panel drawn. I'm waiting for the results but I expect them to be fine. I am in good shape, I walk 6 and a half miles twice a week, I cook all my food myself. Lots of slow cooking. Lots of vegetables. Varied intake; I follow Phinney's work on well-formed ketogenic diet, you know the deal.

I don't suspect I have Familiar Hypercholesterolemia - a drop in LDL like that would rule that out, while a sibling was tested for it and doesn't have it.

But the more studies I read on keto, on saturated fat, on LDL and CVD; there seems to be a serious risk. I try to read the studies on this stuff, I try not to be swindled by youtube wellness grifting.

And I know I need to get my Lp(a), ApoB, VLDL, etc. Will need a private clinic for that as it's not part of a standard panel.

**So here's the rub.** I have young kids. I want to be a good father who isn't carrying the black dog around when going through a dysthymic cycle, but also doesn't keel over in 5 years. Keto is great for me, but I need to be wise here. I am willing to eat differently, to cut out something, to go experiment with which foods seem to trigger my dysthymia. Maybe switch to a less saturated fat keto, more mediterranean. Something like that.

1oynv3m,I’m about to give up,"Please tell me it gets better. I’ve been on a relatively strict 20g carb diet for the past 3 months and have mixed in 14:10 and 16:8 fasting and I see the benefits but the side effects are vicious. The benefits: I’ve gotten a great physique and I looked ripped (like cover of a fitness magazine shredded) but I feel like I’m dying. Everything kicks me out of keto (including a couple of nuts or a small piece of roasted red pepper). My gf is concerned about me because I’m so hyper focused on my diet that I’ve admitted this obsession is effectively an eating disorder. I’m on a normal amount of calories to maintain muscle composition but my water weight can fluctuate 2-3 pounds a day. I am actually getting stronger in the gym! Electrolytes imbalance is wild.

1oygn9g,"Lost 48 lbs, got abs, then overshot & lost too much - now trying to stay at 148 lbs. My keto/low-carb journey so far.","Alright so here’s my full arc because I’ve posted bits and pieces before from a different account but never the full story.

Last year I was 185 pounds (84 kg) at 5’9” - borderline overweight, puffy face, zero definition, felt like crap but told myself “it’s not thaaaat bad” (it was lol).

Started keto-ish low carb, messed around, learned every wrong lesson the hard way… then something clicked. I got consistent. I tracked protein. I fixed electrolytes. I didn’t treat it like a 30-day challenge. I treated it like a system.

Weight dropped slow at first, then very fast.

185 → 148 lbs (67kg) (ideal weight for me)
Visible abs. Face lean. Energy crazy good.
For the first time in years I felt like “oh okay this is what my body is supposed to feel like.”

BUT… here’s where it gets funny.

I stayed strict low carb even after I’d reached goal and started drifting lower and lower without trying. Eventually hit 138 lbs (62 kg), which for my height is borderline “bro are you okay?” territory.

Like abs were there, but so were ribs and people kept saying “uh… you lost weight?” in that concerned auntie way.

So now I’m in the reverse world of diet culture: trying to maintain at 148 instead of just losing.
Not bulking, not dirtying it up,  just finding that healthy sustainable point where I look lean, strong, and not malnourished.

Stuff that helped me avoid keto burnout this time:
	•	Didn’t drop carbs from 150g → 20g overnight like a maniac
	•	Kept protein high
	•	Didn’t binge on “keto junk”
	•	Stuck to boring repeat meals that work for me
	•	Listened to my body instead of Reddit arguments

Right now I’m low-carb (~90-100g net), strength training 3x/week, and finally learning how to hold my progress without turning into a yo-yo statistic. I no longer need outside electrolyte supplements.

If you’re just starting: yes keto works, yes you’ll feel like trash if you do it like an idiot (I did lol), and yes you can overshoot if you don’t have an exit strategy.

Anyway that’s where I’m at.
If anyone else has ever had the opposite problem (losing too much and needing to climb back up), I’d love to hear how you handled it.",1763282366.0,11,8,keto,diet

1oy8etw,One month in and I love it,"One month into keto for mainly weight loss, but also the health benefits of not eating sugar or heavily processed foods. I used to drink 4-5 full sugar pops a day, borderline pre-diabetic. I did kick start ketosis with a 3 day water fast which I think helped. Helps both mentally proving you can control your brain/body and physically helps kickstart ketosis. 

Starting weight was 265, am now at 233 after one month (32 pounds). 43 pounds left to go. My starting macros were 140g protein, 80g fat, 25g carbs. I just recalculated my BMR (taking winter into account where I'm naturally more sedentary). My new macros are 140g protein, 32g fat, 25g carbs. Keeping the protein high to save muscle mass. Though I have quickly realized I now cannot eat as much dairy as is was with this lowered fat intake. 

The beginning was the toughest but after two weeks of my body adjusting I'm rarely hungry, the weird poops are gone and the brain hunger is completely gone. I take a multi vitamin, whey isolate to complete my protein goal each day, and electrolyte drink mix every couple days. I think my favorite meal I have made so far is keto chicken crust pizza. Taco soup is a close second though. My favorite drink in the beginning was a can of a&w zero root beer and 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream...tastes just like a root beer float. Really satisfies any temptations for sugar.

My energy levels are up, way less caffeine needed (unless I get poor sleep). I just had to trim 4"" off my belt today as I ran out of adjustment room (it's one of those ratcheting style belts).

1oxbyj6,Am i doing this right? Keto troubleshooting??,"Hey im new to keto, its been 41 days on this diet, i just wanna make sure im still doing everything correct! Ive read the guide already, i just wanna verify with others that im on track, i apologize :(

I started my weight loss at 143lb starting with CICO, and started keto at 135lb. Im currently at 130lb. I read plateaus are normal, ive been in one for 2 weeks now, but i wanna make sure im following everything right to get out of this stall soon..

•My calorie limit daily is 1353 as of 143lb, according to calculator.net. ive been following that since. I eat about 800-1200 daily due to decreased hunger, eating breakfast (hotdog) and then dinner (meat and minimal veggies) only, and a keto dessert like whip cream or quest rarely. TDEE says 1554 cal for cutting and 2054 cal for maintenence with current weight of 130lb.

•My carbs are limited at <20g daily, i range about 12-16g net. Highest carbs are usually vegetables and keto safe sauces at around 4g.

•My protein goal is 85g, set from my 143lb weight. I hit this daily especially for the gym and muscle growth. I supp with whey if needed or an atkins shake, or an atkins bar rarely. 
*I was told protein will not convert to sugar unless you have kidney issues and shouldnt worry abt kicking out of ketosis.

•I dont usually make my fat goal which is 98g per the 143lb weight. I end the day w around 50-80g.

•I have been measuring every single thing i eat in grams, using the barcodes to pull up the right food items and cross checking everything is correct. So i make sure i am counting everything correctly and painfully.

•According to Omrom my RMR is 1260 last i checked.

•I go to the gym M-F for strength training for an hour, and walk about 5k-10k steps M-F as well.

•I only drink water when thirsty, about 750ml a day, pee is clear. 
*I cant find any info on whether i need to drink excess water to flush extra water out my body, but i heard that once before here. Its difficult to drink more than 2 bottles daily for me.

•I drink a couple sips of ketoade only twice or so a week. I dont feel ill to need to drink it daily or have muscle/fog issues.

•i get about 6-7 hours of sleep daily, my stress could be better but life is life.  


Please let me know if theres anything to improve on so i can do keto better and get out of this plateau! I plan to get to my target of 120lb and bulk up to 130 again for muscle.

1ox2sep,Simple Keto meals and meal prep advice,"Hi all, I'm 33F and and a bit overweight and have recently been diagnosed as prediabetic. I have been wanting to do keto for awhile but I keep putting it off and making excuses but I'm going to buckle down and just do it. 

One of my BIGGEST issues with eating is I work in a factory, Sometimes I work two weeks straight and I work a lot of 12 hour shifts. I get off work, I'm tired I don't want to cook and unhealthy food is so easy to just go get. 

So what are your go to quick and easy meals to make? Or what are some good meals I could cook on my day off and then eat on for the next few days?

1owe6x7,Day 11… why is this getting harder instead of easier?,"Hi everyone,

F27. Lockdown + 2 pregnancies got me to 104 kg. I heard about keto a month ago, bought a few books, and read a lot about it before starting on November 3rd.

Since then, I’ve completely cut out carbs (except for a bit of apple during the first two days) and I’ve been sticking to it. I walk one hour a day and work out twice a week.

By November 10th, I had lost 1 kilogram. It’s great, but I can’t help feeling ashamed and like I’m failing because I still get cravings sometimes. I just want to eat so badly… and sometimes I do. I feel quite hungry. On Tuesday morning, I ate 2 eggs, a whole avocado, and 2 yogurts. This afternoon (2 hours after lunch), I ate 2 yogurts, 3 pieces of chocolate, some cheese, and almonds… It’s not as bad as before, I have to admit, but it still feels like a lot compared to what I *should* be eating.

1ovd67d,"Second keto journey, determined to commit longer","I have spent almost my whole life emotionally depending on food, especially overeating overprocessed foods. Before I moved out of state (Cali to Tennessee), my eating habits were pretty bad. I LOVE food. Instant ramen packs and fast food was my go-to. Food was what made me feel temporarily better, but with the weight I have gained over the years, I'm now in a healthier environment, minimal stress, and I can focus on bettering myself. 

Since moving (October 2024) I've lost over 30lbs. I was reaching 260. It took a while, but what really boosted my weight lost faster than I could blink, was when I went on my first ever keto diet for about a month. It was probably the first time I've ever witnessed myself drop weight(down to 224lbs) in a healthy way. This happened during the summer. I broke keto for a few months because I was advised that its something that shouldn't be done long term. I dont know how true that is, I'm sure it depends on the individual because we are all different. 

Anyways, I've gained some weight back. I'm at 237lbs(I am about to turn 30, I'm 5'2) now and I'm on my second day of getting back into keto. I'm feeling dedicated to committing even longer.

1ouu0lu,Friend reactions to keto feel like a jab.,"For context, I've been friends with this person for very many years and I know her and her reactions and responses like family. Additionally, she is on Ozempic for weight loss.

Whenever I talk about my keto efforts, I always get, ""You're crazy, I could literally never do that."" And, ""It's wild you can do that, I couldn't be that way."" And when I told her I spend free time often thinking about my diet planning, making goals, envisioning my successes, she told me, ""I could never obsess over weight loss like that.""

  
Her tone and the way these things are incorporated into her reactions are really giving 'active discouragement'. Especially when she implies that my goal centered way of being is obsessive. I explained that I'm very relaxed and happy in my thoughts, they aren't ruminations and obsessions. She tried to say we just have different definitions of ""obsession"" but I think everyone knows that obsessed has a negative connotation that undermines the positivity of the mindframe I'm talking about.

I use the tool of visualization to imagine myself keeping up with and attaining my goals. I think about mine and other's experiences and I plan for the future, or figure out how I'm going to travel or go out to eat while remaining on plan. These things are joyful and fun for me. There is no detrimental ruminations on my body or on specific foods. 

It feels these days like she's in a state of jealousy over me feeling good and being excited on my weight loss journey, whereas the Ozempic makes her throw up and feel like garbage constantly. Also, her own weight loss has self admittedly come from a place of self hate, whereas mine comes from assured self love, so maybe she wishes that was how she felt?

1ouqwge,A lengthy guide to Macronutrients,"This guide aims to explain the six major macronutrients as well as fiber in a lot of depth. There's a *lot* of misconceptions that have been floating around for years, so hopefully this will help correct some of them.

**1. Carbs**
*(Limit, <20g or 20-50g)*

* ""Glucose"" is what all dietary carbs turn into eventually, whether that's simple sugars like fructose or lactose or complex starches. Fiber is *chemically* a carbohydrate but doesn't work that way (see that section). 

* Lowering your carb intake is one of two factors to achieve ketosis. Less than 20g ensures ketosis for *everyone*, however individual limits vary and can be as high as 50g, plus an extra ~10g if you're *very* active. 

* When factoring in your carbs for the day, you can subtract erythritol and natural fiber, giving you ""net carbs"". Other sugar alcohols and resistant starch are complicated (see those sections). Note also that depending on where you are in the world, fiber/etc might already be subtracted -- the UK for example.

* The amount of dietary carbs required by the body is *zero*. If you drop below your limit, your body will just make more of its own glucose from protein or the glycerol backbone of fat, in a process called gluconeogenesis (GNG). A lot of GNG happens in ketosis regardless. 

* Carbs can be stored in liver glycogen (100-120g) and are cleared at a rate of 6g per hour. In order to drop back into ketosis after some unfortunate event, you need to clear everything in the digestive tract (4-6 hours) + whatever is in the liver according to that rate, so it's a good metric for how long it'll take.

* Something you'll see a lot is ""carbs are your body's primary source of energy"". This seems silly when you look at human history, but nonetheless your body *does* use glucose even while you're in ketosis for muscle glycogen, some of the brain's energy needs, your red blood cells, etc. As mentioned, your body just makes its own and maintains a lower level of it, or these essential needs can be filled by the carbs in your limit. 

* Carbs are not in the places that you'd expect. Fruit and grains seem obvious, but legumes have quite a bit, some vegetables can be so low that they're practically free, there's 1g per egg, milk has 12g per cup (cheese/yogurt varies), nuts and especially seeds can have moderate amounts. Processed food offers lots of surprises, from deli meat with more carbs than protein to products marked ""low carb"" that demonstrably aren't. It's best to get into the habit of checking labels on anything that isn't a whole food, and tracking those that are.

* Dietary carbs aren't required for exercise. Low intensities use fat already, and higher intensities can be adapted to with some *definite* performance decreases until you achieve that. Carbs do however increase performance regardless of the state of your body, so a targeted intake (TKD) prior to competitive events does make sense -- if you go that route you want straight glucose such as dextrose or glucose pills. Anything beyond competition or *very* active labor where you can't afford to lose performance is better served with adapting to ketogenic exercise.

**2. Protein**
*(Goal, 0.8-1.0 grams per pound of lean body mass)*

Protein is quite controversial and the misconceptions here are the main reason I'm making this guide.

* Protein has a variety of structural uses in the body, and is obviously necessary for muscle growth. You need a bit more on keto as well for GNG purposes. 0.8-1.0 g/lb LBM is a general rule, but you'll need more if you're athletic or *especially* if you're bodybuilding. As a goal rather than a limit, more is better.

* Protein doesn't absorb all at once, *however* unused amino acids can stick around in the intestines for 2-3 days, so protein timing is irrelevant. 

* ""Incomplete proteins"" are a misnomer -- some plant-based proteins are deficient in one or more amino acids, however this just describes a ratio. With volume, this becomes irrelevant. Pork rinds are a bit different since they're almost pure collagen -- not a good total protein source, even in volume. Animal products and soy, meanwhile, are complete. 

* There is exactly one situation where protein can kick you out of ketosis (covered in a bit), but this is by far the biggest misconception in the keto community, either because of its insulin effect or due to GNG. 

* Protein raises insulin because insulin is required to get amino acids into the tissues that need them, however it doesn't cause the insulin spike you see with carbs. There's good evidence that it actually helps *regulate* blood sugar and improve insulin sensitivity. The only time you need to be worried about its insulin effect is if you're a type 1 diabetic so you know how much insulin to dose.

* GNG, meanwhile, is a demand-driven process based on the amount of glucose your body needs to function. It doesn't spike blood sugar because the interplay of hormones would cause it to shut itself off. And it *definitely* doesn't trigger based on the amount of protein you eat. Additional nails in the coffin are the fact that the glycerol backbone of fat can *also* fuel GNG and that leucine/lysine turn into ketones instead (with quite a few playing both roles). 

* Excess protein beyond what the body needs will be deaminated and used for energy *directly*. No conversion to glucose first. The process here is complex and depends on which amino acid you're talking about, but they each enter some part of the citric acid cycle. Incidentally, the common artificial sweetener aspartame does this as well, assuming your body doesn't just use the aspartic acid. See this chart:

https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41392-023-01569-3/MediaObjects/41392_2023_1569_Fig1_HTML.png

* Okay, so the elephant in the room. I mentioned earlier in this post that there are *two* factors to achieving ketosis. One is keeping your carbs low, while the other is large amounts of fat metabolism. This fat doesn't have to come from your diet -- body fat works just as well, which is why fasting also causes ketosis. So something like /r/psmf would also cause ketosis, despite *all* of your dietary calories being protein. You run into issues with ketosis when you're both in maintenance *and* protein is your primary energy source, because there isn't enough fat metabolism to produce the precursors for ketones. I believe you could probably sidestep this if your protein intake is primarily the amino acids in the chart above that turn into acetyl-coa, since that *is* the precursor, but dont quote me on that.

**3. Fat**
*(>50g for sure, otherwise a limit or goal depending on weight goals)*

Fat is quite maligned outside of keto circles. It also has quite a few common misconceptions attached to it. I'll try to cover all of these angles. First, though: 

* Like protein, fat is an *essential* macronutrient, important to the brain, skin health, and used structurally anywhere that lipids are required. A ketogenic diet is great here because you're getting so much of both that you're likely covering all your body needs without overthinking it. Low-fat diets eventually lead to neurological problems for reasons that should be obvious. 

* Omega-6 and omega-3 are essential fatty acids that can't be made from the other fat in your diet. The actual amount required is quite low however -- iirc around one gram of each. Even if you're not explicitly eating fish or flax you should be getting enough on a high-fat diet through sheer volume.

* While we're on the subject, there's some evidence that low omega-3 relative to omega-6 can contribute to inflammation, however I'd take this with a gigantic grain of salt since studies of this kind seem to use vegetable oil rather than the kind found in whole nuts/seeds -- vegetable oil is *notorious* for oxidizing under heat and even sunlight, and processes that extract it *also* tend to use heat. There's quite a lot of hate towards omega-6 despite the fact that it's required, and the science isn't settled. 

* In addition to its structural use and as a source of energy, fat makes vitamin A/D/E/K a lot more bioavailable and has various hormonal uses. Additionally, it requires bile to digest, and the gallbladder stores and concentrates bile for later use, so low-fat diets can cause gallbladder issues. 

* Beyond the amount explicitly required by the body, fat is either a limit or goal depending on your weight goals. It's quite caloric -- ~9 kcal/g unlike the ~4 in protein and carbs. Once you've met your protein goal and are under your carb limit, fat intake is a *lever* that determines whether you lose weight (and how fast), maintain or gain, so adjust your intake according to your needs there.

* Yes, you can gain weight on this diet. One of the occasional misconceptions is that keto can only lead to weight  *loss* because of some hand-wavy pseudoscience about insulin or catabolic hormones. In reality, you can maintain or even gain depending on your total calories, which usually is based on fat intake. That said, if you're not used to eating a high-fat diet, you'll find that you can completely indulge yourself and still lose weight -- the difference here is the ~1120 carb calories that your diet is missing, and/or a high TDEE caused by obesity. 

* On that topic, fat isn't where you'd expect it to be either. We live in a society that's maligned fat intake for the last 80 or so years, so things that intuitively seem to be fatty aren't actually up there by keto standards. Fatty meat for example usually has around a 2:1 ratio of protein to fat (with ribeye being a delicious exception). A slice of bacon has around 3.5g fat, so if you're trying to hit 100g of fat with bacon alone, you'd need *twenty eight* pieces of bacon, also gaining 84g of protein in the process. Whole milk is only 3g of fat above 2% per cup. Cheese is arguably a *protein* source -- white varieties are around a 1:1 ratio of protein to fat while yellow cheese is 2:3 . Even fast food and ice cream aren't really fatty when you run the *actual* numbers -- the excessive calories there come from the ~2:1 ratio of carbs to fat in burgers or whatever, plus additional ones in fries and soda. The most damning piece of evidence here is anecdotal -- I eat more fat on keto when I'm losing weight than I did when I was obese and living on fast food. 

* On keto, a high-fat diet and achieving/maintaining a healthy weight isn't a paradox. The fat here is just replacing the carb calories, as mentioned. Fat is avoided on healthy high-carb diets because there isn't a whole lot of room for it, not because there's some mysterious process that causes you to lose weight in ketosis. Granted, insulin resistance can lower BMR by ~25% and keto both sidesteps and corrects this, so you'll probably see better results here.

* While we're on the subject, one of the big misconceptions about this diet is that your body is using ketones as a fuel source rather than glucose. As mentioned, your body is still using glucose, just less of it. And fat is used *directly* -- ketones are basically just an alternate form of it for the brain. If you're in ketosis, most of your energy needs are coming from fat, and while ketones *can* be used for energy, they aren't your primary fuel source.

* Another misconception is the reverse -- that ketosis causes your body to burn fat. In reality, your body is burning fat even on a high-carb diet; the difference is that insulin prioritizes glucose so 90% of fat metabolism is blocked and the free fat gets stored as body fat instead. If you're in a deficit and either don't have or are below the cutoff for insulin resistance metabolic effects, you'll burn body fat regardless of your diet. Similarly, in keto maintenance quite a bit of the fat you're eating gets stored as body fat, but it gets released again later on so you don't gain weight. 

**3b. Heart health**

Okay, the *other* elephant in the room. There's a lot of topics here to cover, all based around the general idea that eating keto will make your heart explode. 

* The easiest one is that fat intake on its own is not correlated with all-cause mortality. The so-called Seven Countries study misses the 100 other countries that existed in 1955. In particular, western European countries have a high fat intake and also low CVD risk. Incidentally, a more recent study showed that the country with the highest CVD risk also had the highest consumption of cottonseed oil, which is ""healthy"" by anti-saturated fat standards. 

* Trans fat is *very definitely* bad, but the natural trans fat CLA (found in beef and dairy) is cardioprotective. 

* If you go deeper, saturated fat seems to be the culprit, however like carbs and fat in general, this isn't in the places where you think it is. Pork fat for example is 40% saturated, with poultry actually being similar -- ~30. Beef is 50%, much like human body fat. To go higher, you either need dairy (60-70%), cocoa/chocolate (60-65%) or coconut/palm (90%). The latter three have cardioprotective effects, and arguably beef does as well because of the CLA. Pork tends to be higher in *overall* fat, so there's more saturated fat in an absolute sense. I will point out however that factory-farmed pigs live in *horrendous* high-inflammation conditions, and there's enough biological similarity there that they're used for animal testing, so my hypothesis is that we're absorbing cytokines/etc and that's what's *actually* responsible. Processing meat also leads to additional carcinogens being introduced.

* Saturated fat does also raise LDL, and keto itself can as well. LDL, however, has a variety of roles, a big one being the transfer of fat to the tissues that are going to burn it. Smaller and denser versions also push fat into body fat and help with inflammation. Inflammation, incidentally, has more to do with heart disease than anything else -- artery clots are 99% immune cell debris and are driven by systemic inflammation, which ketosis lowers from several different angles.

* LDL on its own isn't a good predictor of heart health. You find high LDL associated with athleticism and fasting, and low LDL, meanwhile, is associated with neurological issues and stroke. This makes sense when you consider the roles of fat in the body. The large and buoyant LDL molecules known as ""chylomicrons"" or ""pattern A cholesterol"" that come from your body delivering fat to be burned are cardioprotective, so a particle size test is a good thing to try if your LDL is high and you're worried.

* Another good predictor of CVD risk is the ratio between triglycerides and HDL. Optimally, you want 2:1 or less trigs. This is going to be a bit wonky if you're actively losing weight, as high trigs indicate either lots of fat storage or lots of fat burning. With keto, the numbers here trend towards 1:1 or even 1:2 over the very long term. 

* The poorly-named ""fatty streaks"" seen in heart disease patients are mostly immune cell debris as mentioned. They're called that not because they contain fat (they do, but not that much), but because they *look* like streaks of fat. 

* It's worth pointing out that ""heart-healthy fat"" sources contain a variety of cardioprotective compounds -- magnesium and vitamin E in seeds/nuts, a large variety of antioxidants in olives, cardioprotective phytonutrients in avocado such as gallic acid and lutein, etc. A good bit of this makes its way into the oils if they're cold-pressed. 

My hypothesis with all of this is that it's the pro-inflammatory compounds in factory-farmed meat and anti-inflammatory compounds in sources of PUFAs that are ultimately responsible, not the composition of fat itself. It's also quite a bit less relevant on keto since ketones are strongly anti-inflammatory themselves, activate the body's own antioxidant system, and ketogenic diets avoid sugar altogether, which causes havoc. But, the science isn't settled one way or the other.

**4. Sugar Alcohols**

* Outside of erythritol, all sugar alcohols eventually turn into glucose. It took a lot of work to figure this out, and it isn't exactly common knowledge. So, that's why it's best to factor them into net carb counts.

* They do have variable absorption rates -- the most egregious is maltitol, whose absorption rate is 5-90%. Quite a range between ""basically free"" and ""definitely contributes to carb counts"". Erythritol doesn't metabolize and passes out of the body unchanged.

* Sugar alcohols that *don't* absorb can cause digestive discomfort. It sucks that them being doable on keto means dealing with more gastrointestinal issues.

* They do have low GI indexes because it takes quite a bit of work to convert them into glucose, so they're a good choice for diabetics that are concerned more with blood sugar spikes than counting carbs.

* As good as erythritol seems to be for keto, it has a controversy attached to it -- several studies link it to blood clot formation. The science is a bit questionable -- in vivo studies with large doses of pure erythritol and the sample population that uses erythritol being the same population that's more likely to have CVD risk anyway. More studies with *actual controls* are needed here.

* Since sugar alcohols that are metabolized do give energy, they're macronutrients, however it's quite low -- somewhere around 2-3 kcal iirc. 

**5. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)**

* SCFAs provide a variety of benefits, such as feeding the colon (though ketones do as well), cardioprotective effects, and crossing the blood-brain barrier to provide a different source of brain energy the way ketones do. 

* They're caloric (somewhere around 3.4 kcal/g, don't quote me) but don't impact ketosis -- they go through the same metabolism route as fat and ketones. 

* They're found naturally in butter (butyric acid, hence the name), fermented dairy (giving Parmesan cheese its smell), and fermented vegetables, and can also be produced by your body when your gut bacteria ferments soluble fiber.

* Additionally, vinegar is 4% acetic acid (a SCFA) and 96% water, while alcohol breaks down into acetic acid. 

* Their essentially is questionable -- as mentioned, the colon also feeds on ketones. They are however responsible for a lot of the effects of fiber.

**6. Alcohol**

* Alcohol has 7 calories per gram, in between carbs and fat. So adjust your macros accordingly if you're going to drink it.

Alcohol on its own doesn't break ketosis -- as mentioned, it turns into acetic acid which gets metabolized the way fat/ketones do. However, there's a couple caveats:

* Outside of spirits, alcohol sources tend to contain carbs, such as beer and sweet wines. Dryer wines have less. Seltzers also contain small amounts. Beer carbs will add up quickly, though low-carb variants do exist.

* The effects are likely going to feel a *LOT* different in ketosis -- possibly worse hangovers, quicker effects, or more energy during since it uses your fat-adapted mitochondria.

* Your body prioritizes clearing alcohol over everything else, including carbs. This *might* have an effect on ketone production, but it's somewhat irrelevant since acetic acid is basically a ketone in all the ways that matter.

**7. Fiber**

* Insoluble and soluble fiber from natural sources are *chemically* carbohydrates, but can be subtracted from the carb count if it isn't already. Insoluble fiber just passes through unchanged, while soluble fiber can ferment into SCFAs if your gut bacteria are up to the job -- making it caloric. The rates here vary quite a bit.

* Fiber has a variety of effects (the SCFAs one has already been mentioned), however quite a few of them are only relevant to high-carb diets such as blood-sugar control and gut bacteria improvements (going keto is *also* a great way to kill pathogenic gut bacteria since you're basically starving them). Thus, fiber's essentiality on keto is pretty questionable. 

* It isn't necessary for digestive movement. High-protein diets slow digestion and produce less waste, so they *appear* to cause constipation, but meanwhile adding large amounts of insoluble fiber to a diet high in protein is a good way to get *actual* constipation. Magnesium helps, in any case.

* Some keto products have a form of fiber known as ""resistant fiber type 4"". Someone here called it ""frankenfiber"" and I like that so much that's what I call it now. Frankenfiber comes under many names -- modified food starch, soluble corn fiber, etc. It's actually starch that's been enzymatically treated to chemically resemble fiber, and human bodies sometimes see through the illusion. If you're getting kicked out of ketosis and don't know why, this is something worth looking into. It isn't 100% though -- for some people it just gets treated as regular fiber. 

* If you do need (or want) fiber for whatever reason, large amounts of it are found in seeds/nuts -- on par with legumes, and quite a bit higher than whole grains. Vegetables vary depending on how what they are and if they're cooked -- cooking breaks down fiber but also reduces water, so you get more fiber from cooked spinach over raw, but less fiber with cooked turnips over raw.

1ouf6bp,Increased metabolism on keto?,"Curious if basal metabolic rate goes up? 
If you are in deep ketosis with 5mM blood ketones and 3mM glucose, that’s 8mM of fuel in your blood round the clock vs the “average” levels of blood glucose of 5mM of a healthy person not on the keto diet. If your blood ketones go to 7-8mM during long term fasting, that’s also a seeming surplus of energy.

I’m just confused at why your body would put out so much energy… your energy expenditure must be going up otherwise the fuel is excreted and wasted or converted back to fat which makes no sense. 
Haven’t found much research about this and very curious.

Edit- if a resting glucose in a non keto person during the day is say 5mM, why doesn’t ketone synthesis stop when it in that range… it doesn’t seem like you need 8mM of total fuel in your body at rest (ketones + glucose).

It just seems like a huge jump and I’m curious why the discrepancy? It just seems like 7-8mM is the combined amount of fuel always present in the blood (for non diabetics) and im wondering why that number?",1762881168.0,0,18,keto,diet
1ouez3d,Just wanting some reassurance,"I started keto in April of this year, and my weight was 98kg. I was skeptical at first and almost gave in when the dreaded 'keto flu' struck, but when I stepped on the scales after two weeks, I couldn't believed the results!! It was the first diet that worked for me, and I couldn't believe it was one that still let me eat cheese and cream. Within four months, I was down to 73kg, which was my lowest weight in about five years. I was on top of the world and finally being confident in my image again.

But life decided to be a bitch after a while. A breakup, falling out with who I thought was a good friend, and being evicted from my (rented) home. All this happened in a short space of time and I just lost the willpower to keep up with keto. I returned to my normal crap diet and within two months, I was back up to 87kg. 

Finally, two weeks ago, I picked myself up and decided to start keto again. I was starting to hate how I looked again and my self-confidence was very low, and I decided it was time to do something about it. Problem is, I weighed myself today for the first time since I started and I haven't lost anything. 

I'm doing everything I did last time - 30g carb limit, same meals and snacks - but last time, I'd lost about four or five kilos by now. It was just dropping off of me. I'm quite devastated that it isn't working the same now.

I don't want to lose hope but I was really hoping the scales would tell me something positive today. I know this can happen sometimes (I've read a few posts that say the second time on keto can be harder) but I'd really appreciate some encouragement right now, because I don't want to lose the will 😅",1762880727.0,8,24,keto,diet

1ouee7z,Faster Ketosis + Cancer,"I fell into keto long before it was cool... back in 2016, because of a Stage 3 cancer diagnosis. There wasn’t much info out there then. Now there’s so much that half of it just muddies the water.

For me, keto has always been pretty simple: about 80% fat, 15% protein, and 5% carbs. When I’m dialed in, my joints are better, my brain feels steadier, and I just feel better generally.

These days I track light ketosis with a glucose under 80 mg/dL and ketones above 0.5 mmol/L. What I’ve been experimenting with lately is how to *get there faster* after an overnight fast. I usually stop eating after dinner, sleep on it, and hit about a 12-hour fast by morning. With a couple tweaks, I’ve been able to slip into ketosis in about 2 to 4 hours after waking.

Here’s what’s worked:

**1. Caprylic Acid (C8)**  
I came across a 2020 Frontiers in Nutrition paper showing that 20 g of caprylic acid can bump ketones to around 0.6 mmol/L in two hours, even with glucose still in the high 80s. I tried it and had almost the same numbers. Pretty wild for something you can grab online for cheap.

**2. Berberine**  
With a bioavailable form of berberine (berbelite), two capsules got me to about 0.5 mmol/L ketones and glucose around 82 mg/dL in roughly three hours. I’ve repeated it enough times that I trust the pattern.

If anyone’s experimenting with getting into ketosis faster, these two have been the biggest needle-movers for me.

**A few practical keto tips that have helped me over the years:**

• Get a meter that checks both glucose and ketones. I use the Precision Xtra and buy the strips on eBay to keep the cost down.  
• Don’t trust “keto” labels blindly. I still aim for the classic macro split.  
• If weight loss is your goal, calories still matter. If the scale is dropping without a calorie deficit, it’s usually water.  
• Electrolytes are not optional. I go heavy on water plus sodium, magnesium, and potassium. LMNT packets have been clutch for me, but plain Real Salt and bulk magnesium/potassium work too.  
• Olive oil and coconut oil are your workhorses. Coconut oil handles heat well, and olive oil is perfect for loading up homemade dressings.  
• My usual rotation looks like:  
– Breakfast: coffee and a Fast Bar  
– Mid-day: 8 olives or 8 macadamias  
– Lunch: veggie soup with almond crackers  
– Dinner: a salad drowned (in a good way) in homemade dressing

Not saying this is *the* way, but it’s what’s kept me consistent, especially when life gets busy. Happy to answer questions if anyone’s playing with similar hacks.",1762879471.0,135,65,keto,diet

1ou1b0i,Keto has helped my anxiety more than I thought possible.,"I started getting severe anxiety about 3 years ago after returning to my high stress job after rehab for fentanyl. It was bad - like - I checked myself in to the loony bin bad. I thought it was from the job, but I left the job, and a year later still had the problem. I would shake - a lot - all the time.  It would be so bad that I constantly coughed until I started gagging and sometimes throwing up.  
  
I started drinking to self medicate, which definitely helped the anxiety, but of course became it's own problem. I'm a restaurant server, and I was drinking on the job regularly, meaning all the time, just so I could serve drinks (otherwise couldn't carry a try or set down glasses because my hands were shaking so bad). I was drinking every day all day, and I was drinking a LOT.  It was all bad.

A friend of mine who is in mental health said that he had learned a lot about keto and that it could help anxiety. So I figured why not, my wife wanted to lose weight anyway.

It was effective. Like, weirdly effective. About two weeks in, shakes were gone. anxiety was gone. I stopped drinking - not like ""on the wagon"" - I actually still drink, but only occasionally and always responsibly. My desire to binge drink was gone. Way more effective than the meds I'd tried, which had unwanted side effects and which I stopped taking long before I started keto.   
  
My depression is also better than it's been, like, ever (also don't take meds for that), although I'm not sure how much of that is just due to my anxiety being gone and my work performance drastically improving and my wife on cloud 9 because I'm doing so well.

1otpwyk,Fasting Insulin in Normal Range 🙌🏻,"About a year ago, my GP tested my fasting insulin and while it could have been significantly worse, my results showed I was in the early stages of insulin resistance. It made sense that losing weight felt practically impossible while also fighting gaining weight eating practically the same diet as my partner. I was constantly tired. My blood pressure was almost always at stage one hypertension. My GP wanted me to start on a GLP-1, but my insurance only covered diabetic prescriptions, not weight loss. I was also struggling with subclincal hypothyroidism and a regular fasting glucose just outside of normal range (but not enough for my endo to diagnose me with prediabetes or test my A1C). I was so frustrated in trying to figure out how to take back control of both my health and my weight. I was putting my name in the hat for clinical studies and attempting the Casey Means approach she laid out in Good Energy (which I’m absolutely not dogging - there’s A LOT of great info in that book). 

Fast forward to May of this year: Someone sent me the podcast interview from Diary of a CEO featuring Dr. Benjamin Bikmin. Dr. Bikmin describing how a low carb lifestyle, especially a ketogenic one could reverse insulin resistance obviously resonated with me. I had tried keto a decade ago, but I had much less information to go off of and fell off the wagon pretty quickly. This time around, I went in prepared. Between this sub, various metabolic expert interviews on YouTube and a better list of recipes at my disposal, I knew I had to at least try for 60 days. Well I’m almost 6 months in, and I can say it has changed my life and likely saved me. 

Today, my GP tested my insulin again and it dropped into the normal range. This was all without any medication. Just diet and exercise. In the past 6 months, I have dropped 40 lbs and gone down 2 pant sizes. My blood pressure is normal every time I test it. I have normal levels of energy (rather than the constant feeling of being depleted). Everything I could have only dreamed of at the beginning of this year. 

I know that this lifestyle isn’t for everyone, but if you’re on the fence or even early in and considering quitting, please know that it can truly make all the difference. Yes, this is n=1, but this sub is full of success stories of reclaiming health. I’m so grateful for this community.

	•	Small things made me upset
	•	I also have OCD/anxiety, and it became worse

It has been happening since last one week.

I am confused because many people say MCT oil gives “clean energy,” but for me it feels like a stimulant.

I cannot take it in the afternoon or night because I worry it will affect my sleep. Morning is the only time I can take it, but morning makes me feel uncomfortable.

My questions:
	1.	Does anyone else feel anxiety or irritation after MCT oil? Or am i too sensitive 
	2.	Will my body get used to it if I take it daily?
	3.	Should I try only ½ teaspoon?
	4.	Or is it better to avoid it?

Thank you for any advice.

This fish is denser in omega-3s than wild salmon. It’s high in healthy fats and low in saturated fat, making it a nutritional powerhouse. The texture is rich, buttery, and flaky. It’s absolutely delicious.

Black cod is also a relatively positive ethical and environmental choice. It’s sustainably fished, and as a deep-sea species, it contains very low levels of mercury compared to other fatty fish.

Also, it’s often more affordable than other premium white fish like halibut or sea bass.

If you enjoy fish and can get your hands on black cod, I highly recommend giving it a try. It might just become a staple in your keto lifestyle.",1762736514.0,62,10,keto,diet
1oszqgp,Carbonated water,"I'm 56, post menopausal, and started keto a couple months ago. Been struggling for the whole time with cravings despite documenting, weighing and measuring my food. I keep to 15g or less of carbs, 90 g of protein and about 70 g or less fat. Not really getting anywhere fast, but I expected that with menopause interfering and thus had resigned to much slower than average weight loss. 

Then I read some people can have issues with artificial sweeteners both causing cravings and also inhibiting weight loss. Okay, so that resonated with me as I have been drinking a can Coke Zero or Dr Pepper Zero along with lots of water with Mio no-sugar flavors. So I decided to stop those immediately and completely. I drank plain water with a bit of lime or lemon for a few days, and the cravings diminished. 

Then a coworker said I should try a sodastream to make plain, unflavored sparkling water.  Sodastream does not add sodium, it's just pressurized CO2. Bought a sodastream and LOVE it. I'm drinking no less than 2 liters minimum of water a day. 

Then the other day read an article that said that carbonation can interfere with weight loss because the carbonation does something with some sort of signal process. My heart dropped to my shoes. Truly. 

So now I'm turning to you.... have any of you had issues with carbonated water (sans flavor, sans sweetener) interfering with your weight loss??? ",1762734941.0,24,51,keto,diet

1osbuda,Need to eat keto for a couple weeks... Send help,"I'm gonna put the tldr at the top for y'all: 

I'm having severe insulin tolerance issues and have to eat next to no carb till I can get on meds in a week... What the hell do I eat? 

The full story: 

I very recently discovered I'm insulin resistant/prediabetic, and was in the process of getting diagnosed (dr wanted to rule out LADA because it runs in my family and I've had some other health issues this year) when I got pregnant! This is very happy news, I've been trying for over a year now. 

However, I've been wearing a CGM to identify my blood sugar triggers for the last month and somewhere around 6weeks pregnant my body decided it just doesn't want to respond to insulin at all anymore. 
We're talking 6mmo/l jumps from eating one piece of homemade sourdough with my eggs in the morning- something that up till now has been completely fine. 

Because of the pregnancy aspect & my primary care provider being away this week it's going to be 1-2 weeks before I can get on meds and I'm terrified if I don't keep my sugars under control I will lose this pregnancy. Because even 5g of carbs are messing with me. 

So here I am. Please help me, what the hell do I eat for dinners & easy lunches for the next week or so? What should I expect to experience being super low carb? This is all so new to me, as up till now I've had very little restrictions on my diet. So I am at a loss. 

Tonight I ate a big salad with Greek yogurt and Mexican seasoned chicken but I don't want to eat chicken salad every day for the next week. Ideally food that's simple to make as I work full time & really filling.

1os5gr5,One Year on Keto: Down 100 Pounds,"It's been my first year on Keto, so I decided to write a post. I've learned a lot from this subreddit, and maybe others will find my experience useful as well. 

I started Keto to improve my A1C levels (too much sugar in my blood) and address my (pre?)diabetes.

My diet:
1. Max, 25-30g net carbs per day
2. Max, 1800-2000 calories per day
3. At least 100g of protein per day
4. Intermittent fasting 16:8. I only eat lunch (around 1 pm) and dinner (around 8 pm). No snacks or breakfast.
5. I drink black coffee, black tea, green tea, and water throughout the day (about 6–8 cups total for coffee and tea).

A year ago, I weighed around 270 lbs, and my current weight is 172 lbs.

I got a lot of help (diet, lifestyle, food ideas) from:

6. https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheese/

8. https://www.reddit.com/r/1500isplenty/

Foods I eat regularly:
1. Chicken
2. Pork
3. Lamb
4. Beef
5. Eggs
6. Butter
7. Hard, and semi hard cheese
8. Cottage cheese (Good culture) - mostly, 2% fat, if available
9. Plain greek yogurt (fage or chobani) - mostly, 0% fat, if available
10. Celery
11. Tomatoes (raw, and in stews)
12. Cucumbers (raw, and lacto fermented)
13. Radish 
14. Mushrooms 
15. Cabbage (raw, sauerkraut, stews)
16. Broccoli, broccolini, cauliflower
17. Brussel sprouts
18. Asparagus
19. Arugula, spinach, romaine, iceberg and other lettuce
20. Yellow onion (in stews, in super moderate)
21. Carrot (in stews, in super moderate)
22. Green peppers (jalapeno, anaheim, poblano, hatch)
23. Dijon mustard, Vinegar, olive oil, avocado oil
24. Garlic
25. Fresh herbs (e.g., basil and italian parsley)
26. Salt, black pepper, and dried spices 
27. Black coffee, black tea, green tea, water

Meals I usually cook:
1. Stews, and braising  meat with beef, or pork and vegetables
2. Roasted meat + vegetables in Oven
3. Dutch Oven Chili
4. Fried eggs, scrambled eggs and omelette
5. Salads (either just vegetables, or also leftover cold meat with vegetables)

Physical activity
1. 5000-10000 steps per day
2. Upper body strength workout with dumbbells at home, 3 times per week, 20 minutes per session.
3. At least 7 hours of sleep per night

My successes:
1. I've managed to lose weight for the first time in my life. I always struggled with this because I really enjoy eating.
2. I eat food that tastes good (not amazing, but perfectly fine) and still manage my weight.
3. I no longer feel sleepy in the middle of the day.
4. No sudden hunger; I just eat on a fixed schedule.

Problems I still haven't solved:
1. My mouth is often dry, and I feel the need to drink constantly. 
2. I pee many times per day.
3. I sometimes have severe constipation.
4. I feel like I have less energy than before. 
5. I struggle with strength workouts. Even lifting light weights (like 10 lbs) feels hard. Basically, I have very little strength.
6. It's really difficult to eat outside of home or the office, where I have full control. Finding Keto-friendly food at restaurants takes extra effort. It's easier to skip eating out or just have coffee. Usually not a problem since I eat twice a day, but traveling makes it tricky.
7. I'm not sure what my long-term plan should be. Keto works great for weight loss, but it requires a lot of mental effort, like meal prepping, tracking net carbs, avoiding hidden sugars (like in salad dressings). It works, but it definitely takes up some brain energy.",1762649009.0,276,58,keto,diet

1os1m59,Suddenly turned off keto,"I’ve been on keto for two years and recently feel turned off keto food. The idea of meat suddenly feels quite unappealing.

I am on keto for overall health benefits and not weight loss. Keto makes me less grumpy.

I’m wondering if I should just listen to my body and stay off keto until I’m ready to go back on. But I do not like how my brain or body feels being off keto.

Has anyone had a similar experience? Did you overcome it? If so, how?

Edit:

I want to clarify that my keto meals are actually very varied and I make keto versions of Chinese, Thai and western meals. I don’t eat much by way of processed foods like low carb tortillas or keto desserts because I don’t crave these keto substitutes. My main issue lately has been general feeling of mild nausea when contemplating non carb keto meals and I’m unsure why I suddenly feel this way. 

I’ve been off keto for two weeks and eating non keto foods well. Apart from the grumpiness I feel when off keto and bloating!

I truly felt that way. I don’t drink, but I have a crazy sweet tooth and it always helps to quiet that noise. 

Anyway, I just had my third child almost eight months ago and I am really struggling with my weight. I was at the heaviest I’ve ever been when I got pregnant in 2024 and that was really hard for me. Nonetheless, I got through the pregnancy and it was obviously all worth it. This extra 50 pounds on me isn’t it. I have a very busy life. I’m a working mom and we don’t currently have childcare for the baby as we both work from home and can wing it (for now). 

The point of this post is do I just say f it and go all in on keto? I’m scared about the holidays coming up and adding to the weight gain. I just really need to get the weight off, I feel so uncomfortable in my skin. And I know, I just had a baby. Yes, have grace with myself. I get it.

1orayyw,Just started with keto diet,"A few months ago, I wanted to change my lifestyle. My oldest kid complained that I did not spend enough time with her. I hope you guys like to hear my story and change in lifestyle.

  
So I changed my sleeping hours, never in my life I had any system. I just went to bed when I was tired and woke up when the alarm did go off.  
Now I managed to sleep between 02.00 till 09.00, this is working very well this month, and I found out that I have more energy then before.  
I also changed my eating schedule, normally I would 1 eat somewhere around 14.00 and again around diner time and around 23.00, because back in the day it was normal to stay awake till 04.00 or later.  
Now I manage to eat around 12.00 and again around 18.00 hours. And that's it.   
Another big difference is that I stopped with chips and soda drinks.  
So I changed all these things and was hoping to lose weight. But so far no luck.  
So now a new plan, I started a week ago with this Keto diet. Well I have to say, t is very hard.  
I hate the food and miss the nice diners. Also I am dizzy, tired, irritated and so hungry. But what I have read is that this is all part of the diet.  
My wife is very supportive and helps with the cooking. So no potatoes, rice, pasta, bread, fruit or apple pie (my wife makes the best).  
It is hard to see the kids eat all the good food and I am bound to cauliflower rice, omelets and salads. And don't forget about the meat, I like meat, but not this much hahaha.

I always liked to work out, we have our own gym inside our house, although we are rebuilding it for the last few months. It is almost done, only have to find a new floor. Can't wait to start again.

But I will hold on, at least for 2 months, then I have to travel for 2 weeks to The Netherlands, where I have to eat from supermarkets and restaurants. And if you know The Netherlands, you know it is all not so good. Profit above good food ;-)

I do not know if and for how long I can manage this diet, but I am determined to try my best. And hope I will get a better figure. ",1762561140.0,9,20,keto,diet

Are you allergic to nuts?”  “No I just am refraining from carbs and sugar” “why” (in a really winey and sarcastic tone)  

So, today I decided to sit in her office and described to her how I had blood in my shit and then a colon infection and polyp removal and diverticulitis and I talked like it was a college lecture.  describing every little tiny disgusting detail.

 “Man explaining” and over sharing. I could see how uncomfortable it makes her and other as I now have started to do this. I had a manager that is a vegetarian and he tried to explain to me how I need carbs and sugar for my brain to function properly… again, the lecture of the bloody stool and the polyps and the avoiding getting 18 inches of my bowels removed and avoiding surgery..

The thing is- I already have tried to tell her and my manager “no thank you. i have been watching my carbs and sugar” and I have already been ridiculed. We have already had these conversations. They love to play dumb and pretend like I’ve never told them this. It’s like a challenge to see if they can wear me down.

It’s like going out with drunks that keep telling you to drink more drink more even when you tell them you’re done drinking for the night because you know you’re gonna throw up. 

Every time someone wants to share their sage wisdom about my diet and what I should be putting in my own body is now going to get the bloody shit and polyps followed by no diverticulitis and only two less than 1 mm polyps on my next colonoscopy story. 

Their fake concern for me and pathological need to educate and mock me has caused me to tell my juicy story to them. 

I lost 78 pounds and feel great. I poop regularly any there is never blood or pain. I don’t get gas and anal leaking. And IBS and cramps…

FU normal people who eat what ever.. i don’t lecture you about how the candy can fk up your pancreas and you’ll get diabetes and have to get your leg chopped off… stop talking about my “brain not getting sugar and carbs” my brain works great. I feel clean. I feel clear minded. 

When I do cheat meals like going out to eat with my gf, I feel mentally foggy & get bowel issues.

1opd866,Keto for Bipolar- Doing everything Right and Having No Results,"Hi everyone,  
  
I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder 4 years ago and since then have not stopped to fight to improve my mental health. Along with mood swings I get severe OCD symptoms, brain fog, and memory issues.

After advocating and fighting to improve my mental health, I stumbled on Chris Palmers work. Since then, I’ve gone all in with the Keto diet. It was a bit of trail and error but after buying a keto mojo meter, I started having a lot of success.

I know how to cook and I can get creative enough in the kitchen to mix things up. After trial and error though, I found my carbohydrate threshold is typically under 10 so I switched to a carnivore diet. My typical meals look like bacon and eggs, ribeyes with compound butter, chicken or tuna “salad” (like the sandwich mix with no bread and a ridiculous amount of homemade mayo), and garlic shrimp in a ton of butter. I mix up my protein with pork, seafood + mix up how I cook chicken. I eat cheese, macadamia nuts, bubly soda water, and some deli meats for snacks. My only sources of carbs come from the small amount in some cheeses and or the deli meats I eat.  
  
With this diet, on good days, my macros stay around 300+ grams of fat, approx 200 grams of protein, and less than 10 grams of carbs.

I’ve been looking into things further and try now keep snacking to a minimum and spacing out my meals.  
  
Initially my GKI would be as low as 2.4 – 6.5ish. When I was in these therapeutic levels, I felt better than I ever have. My cognition was sharp, memory was incredible, and I had 0 symptoms of OCD, mania or depression. Keto was a God send.  
  
My diet and macros have not changed but for some reason, after a month or so, my GKI started to plateau and get worse. I would be eating 250+ grams of fat, lower protein, and only getting into very low levels of ketosis or even fluctuating out of ketosis.

Because I was fluctuating in and out of low levels of ketosis, I felt like I was in a semi fluid state of keto flu where my sleep would be poor and I’d have low energy and brain fog. I also am still not sure if this is relevant but I thought I’d mention it just in case - towards the end I also starting getting these brain “zaps” exactly like when I would forget my dose of SNRI in the past.

On Canadian thanksgiving my dad ordered a nostalgic family meal that I hadn’t had in a long time and chose not to eat it. I’m fine with choosing not to eat things I like and think it’s reasonable to go off my diet for holidays if choose. But the problem is that I’ve sacrificed so much to have success with this diet – money, time, turning down things I wanted but am not fine with making those sacrifices and having them not pay off.  
  
Things came to a culmination when I did everything I knew how to with my lifestyle for me to get into therapeutic ketosis. I ate 300 grams of fat, 200 grams of protein, and 9 grams of carbs at the day prior. I woke up, didn’t eat breakfast so I could intermittent fast, and hit a fasted workout. Before the workout (and after a couple hours of waking up) my GKI was 12.5 (Glucose – 5.0 mmol/L . Ketones – 0.4 mmol/L). after the workout my GKI was worse at 17.6 (12.5 (Glucose - 5.3 mmol/L . Ketones 0.3 mmol/L) which means I was not in ketosis before or after.

I’ve considered a number of variables and it makes no sense to me. My macros are solid, and have been consistent with them.



I’m still completely committed to the Keto diet and fighting to improve my health. I decided to spend a week and recoup, create a Reddit account and continue to push forward.  
  
If anyone could speak to my situation or point me in the right direction it would mean the world to me.

  
TL;DR

Keto for Bipolar disorder. Consistently getting 300g fat, 200g protein, 10g carbs. 2 solid meals and no snacking. Initially had success but after a month, GKI numbers plateaued and eventually began to go in and out of ketosis without changing anything.",1762372347.0,0,21,keto,diet

1opbowj,Cholesterol questions,"Okay I've got three sets of numbers. I do take 5 mg of crestor. Has seemed to help and I have no side effects. I am a 37 year old male, 6'1"", 231 lbs. I've lost 17 lbs in 2 months with this current run of keto. I absolutely love it and it helps keep me disciplined. Exercise has been somewhat limited. Here and there, but not super consistent. I did a CAC test and had 0% last year. EXT Lp(A) test came back at 10.9 (over 30 seems bad). 

I do tbs of butter and MCT in every morning cup of coffee. Most common meals are salads with olive oil, venison, chicken thighs, venison/pork sausage, pork rinds, cheese, bacon, eggs, ground beef, broccoli, cauliflower, peppers.

**First in the series below is baseline -** no keto, with the statin  
**Second is a number from a year ago** \- After 3 months of keto, without  a statin. I quit keto at that point.   
**Third number is today -** Two months into keto, with the statin. I have lost 17 lbs since then and am continuing to lose weight at a nice clip. 

  
CHOL (mg/dL): 214 / 320 / 255  
TRIG (mg/dL): 155 / 159 / 237  
HDL (mg/dL): 50 / 50 / 37  
LDLC (ratio): 133 / 239 / 170  
VLDLC (ratio): 31 / 32 / 47  
NON-HDL (mg/dL): 164 / 270 / 218

Not sure how to interpret all of this. That high triglycerides number seems bad... And the drop in HDL. 

Dr. GPT says that it's worth this temporary spike while I am losing significant amount of weight. Basically, if I did this for a year and was no longer obese, I could get it under control at that point. And there's also the mention that during periods of weight loss, numbers can spike. 

So my plan is stay the course, keep losing weight, try and exercise a bit more, stay on the statin, integrate more olive oil, fish and avocados. Then deal with this the right way at the end - more fiber, cut saturated fat, etc.

1oovg4n,Intense jitters & chocolate cravings on Day 3.,"
Hello everyone : )

I've recently started keto again after 3years and I notice myself getting extremely jittery and having an intense craving for chocolates everytime I'd wake up on the 3rd day.

Over the past 2 weeks, I've tried again and again but this always happens immediately after waking up and it's ALWAYS on day 3.

My current keto macros:
- Total calories per day: 1600-1700 (slightly above my TDEE of 1450cals).
- Carbs: 25-30g.
- Protein: ~170g.
- Fat: ~70g-80g.

Other things:
- IF from 7pm-10.45am (when I usually wake up).
- My typical keto foods: lots of cheese, chicken breasts, some steak, keto nut bread, arugula, smoked salmon, sausages.
- x2 psyllium husk capsules during lunch and dinner.
- I've stopped doing my usual 30mins of cardio while my body adjusts to the keto diet.
- Not taking any electrolyte supplements at the moment as I'm consuming about 2000mg of sodium a day. I also do not sweat at all since I don't exercise and I'm in an airconditioned environment 24/7. 

Now I'm wondering if there's anything I'm doing wrong or if there's something that could be adjusted to prevent those morning cravings and jitters. Would incorporating magnesium supplements before I sleep fix those issues? Or should I wake up earlier? 

I'd greatly appreciate any insights, advice and recommendations : )

1ooersa,Are my expectations too high?,"Tl/dr: How long does it take on average to enter nutritional ketosis and therapeutic ketosis? Does higher body weight impact this? 



This is my second time trying to reach and maintain therapeutic ketosis. While my care team (PCP, dietician, therapist, APRN (psych prescriber)) was initially skeptical about trying metabolic therapies (more than just ketogenic diet), but my results were astounding. I got a little sloppy a few months after hitting my first goal for therapeutic ketosis (to get off an antipsychotic that caused me to develop Tardive Dyskinesia) which led to a rebound honestly where I quit keto altogether. 

  
Recently my spouse and care team encouraged me to give it a second go and stay consistent. I started 5 days ago, also adding in intermittent fasting. Here is the crux of my issue: getting in to ketosis is more of a struggle this time. Following the guidelines I was given, I am eating less than 20 grams of net carbs (only excluding fiber, not sugar alcohols), eating a moderate amount of protein (20-25%) making sure to hit a certain protein goal at minimum, and the rest fat. 

I have a KetoMojo meter which I use to test GKI (a measurement that connects blood glucose and ketone level) and overall ketones. I test before I break my fast and sometimes after a meal I am concerned about. Yesterday (Day 4), I hit a GKI of 8.6, light ketosis. Today, I dropped out of ketosis according to the GKI score and hit the minimum of nutritional ketone level as well. 

The patterns I am noticing: my blood glucose is higher than it was previously, my ketones aren't going up as quickly. Last time I did keto I was already at a healthy weight. I have gained around 45 pounds since I stopped in May, likely due to overindulgence in carbs and not tracking calories. This is the second time I have hit this weight (my highest). Last time I was recommended to do a low-fat diet, which was affective in losing weight, even if not ideal for overall health. 

Is this fluctuation early on normal? Does my body weight impact how long it takes to get into ketosis and/or higher fasting blood glucose? Any tips for getting into therapeutic ketosis for those who are using that?",1762280234.0,7,32,keto,diet

I had struggled, feeling like I was always starving, to lose just 10 lbs.

So I paid for one month of the Stelo CGM (only one available without prescription in the U.S. at the time), because doc said until I actually cross the threshold, insurance won't cover anything like that.

My husband had started keto, and was losing weight easily. So I put on the CGM, and spent two weeks on my ""usual"" diet, and then switched to husband's diet (mostly carnivore, snacking on cheese, nuts, butter, etc). The logging taught me what I needed, what foods spiked my blood sugar, etc.

Now one year later, I am down another 20 lbs. If I feel hungry, I eat. I don't track calories, or even macros. When my dad was diagnosed with pre-diabetes about 30 years ago, my mom read all the books, learned a whole new way of cooking, etc, but my dad said ""just give me a simple guidelibe I can follow when I need to choose something to eat"" and her rule she gave him was ""don't have more than 10g sugar in one sitting"".

So I tend to use the same guideline because it's so simple.

I can't emphasize enough the contrast, mentally, between obsessive Cico and keto. I would weigh out my meal, logging on Fitbit app, until I had reached my allotted calories, and sit down to eat, and know that I would not feel full when done. Before even finishing, I would be thinking about when is my next meal. How many calories left in my budget. What foods can I fill that budget with to try and satiate my hunger. I would have to stop tracking after 3 months, and give myself a week off, or else I would be a miserable bitch.

I will say, I did learn from all the tracking, how to eyeball portion sizes pretty well. And learn what the macros are like for a lot of whole foods, which is useful.

Oh, and in addition to the A1C victory, all my lipid panel numbers went in the right direction too. They weren't out of range but they were heading the wrong way, and now they are going back.",1762263970.0,93,11,keto,diet

1oo3qvf,"Keto, fasting, OMAD, exercise daily","Hello!

I am doing 20-24h fasting since September. I am doing it mainly to reduce visceral fat (but also improve overall health and want to keep it like that), and have lost 8 kgs (I am 1,92 height and 79 kgs now), so now I think I am spot on, but would like more muscle. I am doing one day walking-running, and next day some resistance exercise home. Very happy in general, more energy, no energy dips!

Last day went for a lipid test and all numbers were normal, except very high triglycerides level, around 260(Norm Range<150), which is far beyond normal. Previous day had my exercise afternoon and then had dinner around 10. Blood test was taken around 10 in morning. Doctor is also puzzled because previous triglyceride level some months ago was around 107.

My question is if anyone has any experience going between the two? I made the decision to be AIP (then keto I guess) because I have an autoimmune disease, along with some other minute health problems. 

Also, sweeteners? I’m trying to not rely on sweeteners at all and I’ve been fine but once in a while I do want to bake something. Usually I use a small amount of maple syrup. AIP doesn’t do sweeteners and keto sweetners are NOT complaint w AIP. Sigh… sacrifices ",1762212043.0,2,7,keto,diet
1onqu3j,Keto on SSRIs,"Has anyone found keto not working as well on SSRIs?

I have been keto continuously for 5 and a half years.
 When I started, I was on vortioextine (an antidepressant but not an ssri). I started this a few months before I started keto. I lost 4 stone (56 lbs) within about a year and kept it off for 3 years until I had to switch to an SSRI. Since then, despite continuing keto, I have put on 18 lbs, without changing my diet. In fact, I am now having to eat less and less, whereas before, I could eat as much as I wanted.

I had previously (before the vortioextine and keto) been on SSRIs for 18 years and overweight the entire time since going on them. It had never occurred to me that the SSRIs contributed to the weight gain. 

Now I am wondering...do SSRIs make you pile the weight on no matter what your diet, or do they just not go well with keto? 

I imagine the answer may be more individual and that my body just piles on weight in response to SSRIs, but interested to hear other's experiences.

I have been on keto for about 4 months now. I am on it as a hopeful cure for mental health and metabolic issues.

For reference I have been tracking and have been in consistent ketosis, although sometimes much lower levels than others.

1onb2e9,Keto troubleshooting!,"
Hey everyone, I’m a 26 y/o female, 60kg, and have been doing keto for about a month. My ketones were going between 0.5 in the morning to 2 in the afternoon. It was a struggle for my body to adapt and but i know I’ve in constant ketosis for about three weeks. 

(To clarify, I’m not asking for specific medical advice, just thoughts!) 

I started having a tight chest when I was eating a lot of protein and fat. It felt like someone was standing on my chest - mostly on my right side and somewhat going into my shoulder and it was constant. My pulse was going fast and one day went really fast one day after over-eating fat/ protein (because I thought I had to stuff myself with it) and I went to the hospital because I was worried but they couldn’t find anything abnormal, with blood tests, ecg, blood pressure monitoring and an xray. The only thing they conclusively found was an elevated pulse. 

Skip to the present, I have still been in ketosis for 2 weeks since the hospital and have been eating much less protein and running all my macros through chatgpt which has helped immensely. I was always still in the general range of keto macro goals pre-hospital but I’ve started eating less and that has helped as I was over eating because I thought I had to meet the target of 150g fat a day. I stay in keto at 80-100. I’ve been working with a nutritionist and paying a lot (that’s another story), but I’m still not feeling well. 

It now feels like a constant pinching in my upper right hand chest and shoulder. Sometimes I can feel my heart go a little funny and feel a bit hollow, but as the doctors found nothing - even my psychiatrist checked my bloods incase my medication was affecting my heart (which it can do in young people) but they said they couldn’t see anything. Sometimes that feeling goes away and I’m just left with a fast heart rate and it feels like intense physical anxiety - even though I’m not anxious. 

I mostly eat beef, chicken, pork, quite a lot of dairy, which my nutritionist said could be a problem, some veg and always only whole foods and always under 15g carbs. 

I know a lot of people who have heart issues on keto usually link it to electrolytes but I always have two electrolyte drinks a day - two 500ml with 1/3 tsp lo-salt, 1/3 salt and 1 magnesium capsule. 

It’s really been getting me down and preventing me from feeling healthy. I’m doing the diet to see if it will help with mental health problems and unfortunately it’s just causing more stress - and I know I have to wait 3 months to see changes, and it feels like I might not get there at this rate. I’ve eliminated that it’s nothing serious in moment, but what it could be I’m not sure - is it health anxiety, or muscular tension, or a food intolerance or too much dairy, the medication I’m on or just my body not liking ketosis and maybe I should go into low carb. 

It’s so strange to be doing something I know is so good for my health but feeling pain and stressed! I don’t understand why when I’ve been eating absolute crap I don’t get pain but when I go to nutritious, dense food it goes tits up. I really just wanted to have a good experience because I know the power of what I eat can change my brain and health for the better.

Any suggestions/ comments/ ideas welcome, if anyone has been through a similar experience or any guidance would be so so so appreciated!

1omuzbn,Not sure which group is for me,"I was following a ""keto inspired"" diet/lifestyle for the last half dozen or so years. I don't measure, I don't obsess about tracking macros, but my instinct was always leading me toward 10-20% calories from carbs, though I do occasionally drop down into the single digits. Yes, it's higher than the 5% that I usually see people talking about, but in all honesty, if I felt good and never had cravings or ""keto flu"", had improving labs and was losing weight, it seems like a win to me. Over the last few years, I lost 100+ lbs, though I'm not sure exactly where I started. I'm OK with it.

UInfortunately, in the last few months, I was put on a medication that's messing with my body cues.  Combine that with massive financial stress and you get to much carb heavier meals... and weight gain.  I don't do non-caloric sweeteners at all (even ""natural"" ones) and prefer to avoid them most of the time.  In addition to being more attracted to carbs, I also am having less impulse control... so I've gained about 20 lbs.

I don't want to gain the rest back for SO many reasons, but I also don't know how to afford to cut back on the starch. I've been eating a lot of legumes. And, of course, the refined starches and sugar can't help matters, though I don't eat a LOT of those, even now. Well, let's not count Halloween candy because once that's gone, it's gone.

Long time reader, first time poster. 

Reading through this subreddit has educated me to no end about how to use this way of eating for my autoimmune disease and weight loss. I appreciate the community & depth of knowledge. I’ve learned a lot. 

One comment I’ve seen repeated is that alcohol kicks you out of ketosis because the liver prioritizes metabolizing alcohol. What I’m curious about is how long that lasts. According to a brief search of the interwebs, it takes the liver approximately an hour to metabolize 1.5 oz of liquor, 1 glass of wine or a beer. 

So are you out of ketosis for one hour x the number of drinks?  Or is it more complicated than that?

I have lost 10 lbs. which is most likely mostly water, but it shows that it is working. Also j really don’t know if I can stay under 20, I like dairy and small treats too much.

1olb99e,“You’re thin so you can eat THAT” (hyper caloric garbage food),"How often are you in mixed company with a table full of junk food you wouldn’t dare feed your dog and you are told such nonsense? My mother and I both lifelong health nut, skinny diabetic patients used to hear it a lot. I switched to low carb/keto after kids were born almost 20y ago because for a while didn’t have time to exercise. Definitely made things easier. Never had a weight issue though I can see how I might have if I hadn’t taken corrective actions as I’ve gotten older. Anyhow some recent posts not quite about this topic reminded me of what I used to hear so much. I think most have figured out you are what you eat by now.

1okoz2v,Can I lose 15lbs in 4-5 weeks?,"I'm a 26M, 5'10-5'11, 196lbs. 

I'm in the Army. Always been on the heavier side, and have always needed to be taped. I'm 196lbs and need to get below 185lbs to ensure I don't need to be taped anymore. 

Army tape test says I'm 23% bf with a 36 inch waist, which is failing for my age group. I need to be 22% or less, or weigh 185lbs or less. Inbody scan says 19%, but that doesn't count. 

I run 20-30 miles per week, have a great vo2 max and hit the gym about 3 days per week. This is all on top of the mandatory PT we do at the crack of dawn 5 days per week in the Army. So that being said, I workout a lot. I usually burn north of 3,000 calories per day (calories burnt from existing + workouts) on average, just depends. 

Before I joined the Army I was 265lbs, so I'm grateful to have lost the weight I already have. However,I have a mandatory height and weight measurement ""sometime in December"". I know with my loose skin around my stomach not taping in my favor - I need to lose this weight to pass not only now, but reliably for the foreseeable future. 

I usually have to fast, hit the sauna, empty my bowels, and suck it in a little to pass the waist measurement and I'm tired of doing this when I'm so close to passing the weight portion. 

For reference, we do a weight measurement first and if I'm below the max allowable weight for my height and age, I don't need to be taped.

All this to say, can I lose this amount of weight, or more on Keto in this amount of time?

 What should I be eating, should intermittent fast, what should my deficit look like? Hard to consider these things without help, knowing nothing about this diet and being so active. ",1761899007.0,16,74,keto,diet

I M24 started keto 2 weeks ago and I checked my scale today and I couldn’t believe I lost 20lbs in 2 weeks. Started at 230lbs and I checked today and it was 210lbs! Im doing a fast and caloric deficit I eat about 800-1000 calories a day fast for 16-20 hours OMAD and a coffee with a splash of heavy cream in the morning. I should quit coffee but I can’t take that away from my day lol. I initially started this diet because I had blood sugar spikes throughout the day and felt awful during the day and ate lots of carbs and sugars regularly. My dr told me this diet could benefit me to bring down my blood sugar and my A1C. It was 5.6 or 5.7 I forget but it was too high for my age my dr said and also to control my food cravings. So I started and the first 4 days were rough I had the keto flu so I started taking magnesium, potassium and sodium supplements drinking plenty of water. I feel a lot better today and my cravings and appetite are mostly gone. I couldn’t believe how much weight I lost in 2 weeks I know it’s probably just water weight but it’s very motivating to see and I’ll continue to do this diet it completely changed the way I view food.",1761885174.0,80,34,keto,diet

1ok73n5,Update: B1/thiamin stopped my nightly leg cramps!,"Tldr; Supplementing B1/thiamin cured my nightly leg cramps!

Hi Friends!  I started keto 1/1/25 and I am 1.2 lbs from my goal weight!  More on that when I reach my goal.  I wanted to share the solution to my nightly leg cramps problem! I have been consistently struggling with nightly leg cramps since a couple of weeks after starting keto.  I implemented all of the electrolyte recommendations in the FAQ and the suggestions you all have given me throughout this year, but nothing stopped the nightly cramps. I saw a vascular surgeon and had a venous doppler to check my arteries and veins also.  I was desperate for sleep.   As it turns out being on keto made me B1/thiamin deficient.  The major sources of B1 in my pre-keto diet were wheat products and black beans and those were gone once I started keto.  Within a couple of days of starting B1/thiamin (Pure Encapsulations supposedly has the best B1 and they make a good product) the nightly cramps stopped.   It has been two weeks.  I am a root cause girl, and I am so thankful to find the answer.  I will start bringing some B1 foods back in my diet within my carb plan.

In July I went to see a foot doctor about an issue and mentioned my nightly leg cramps to her.  She asked all of the usual questions (electrolytes, hydration, etc.) which I had the right answers for.  She said it sounded like lactic acid (which I’ve learned isn’t really a thing) was building up in my calves and that would cause night cramps.  I mentioned that to my chiropractor who suggested I try soaking my calves in Epsom salt.  If that worked it would validate the foot doctor’s suggestion.  Well, it worked!  I started soaking in a wastebasket (I don’t like sitting in a tub) almost every night.  It was a pain but helped.  I started researching lactic acid buildup and found a couple of relevant articles on Dr. Axe’s website.  That led me to try B1.

I wanted to share this with all of you who also deal with post-keto nightly leg cramps!  Given all that this sub has given me I would love to be able to help someone else.

One note, there was 1 night in the past two weeks (Sunday) that I had night cramps.  That day I had consumed wine, more wine than I would normally drink.  As it turns out sulphites can affect the absorption of B1. I will be more mindful the next time I have wine especially until my B1 levels are back to normal.",1761847743.0,17,21,keto,diet

1ok100q,Five Months of Keto,"This is a follow up to my [Four Months of Keto](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1nud6hl/four_months_of_keto/) post, using this as a personal diary of my ketogenic journey.

I give my background in [my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1lo847o/one_month_of_keto/) and what prompted me to start a ketogenic diet. My goal here is to share my updates and observations after five months.  Hopefully folks here will find what I share helpful.

TL;DR: Lost 4 more pounds, still feeling grateful and I have maintained energy. Life is good.

My notes for this month:

* Down 4 pounds to 208:
   * Big update: I am no longer ""obese,"" at least according to my Body Mass Index (BMI), which is now below 25.  That's a *big* intermediate goal for me and impacted me more than I thought it would.  I've been ""obese"" most of my adult life, hovering around 30 with my BMI.
   * Weight loss happens in steps. I seemed stuck at the same weight the first two weeks of the month, then dropped four in 10 days, at least according to the scale.  My average is a pound a week of weight loss, but the scale might not show anything for a week or two.
* Trying some new foods:
   * I've mixed in plain yogurt, a few peanuts and almonds and raspberries recently. Felt like I needed more probiotics and fiber along with just more variety in my diet.  So far, so good.
* Food tracking
   * Started tracking protein as well as net carbs.  Easily over 100 grams of protein a day, but below 150.
   * Stopped checking ketone levels every day for a couple weeks because test strips (I use the blood test) are not cheap and I track carbs.  Reordered some today anyway.
   * It's been getting harder to stay at or under my daily calorie count on my tracker.  As I've lost weight, it's recommended calorie count has dropped (understandably) from around 2,000 a day to about 1,800 a day.  I have it set to have me lose 1.5 pounds a week.  I've only lost a pound a week this month, so I'm likely not burning as much as the counter (LoseIt combined with my Apple Watch) thinks I am or I'm eating more than I think I do (likely).
* Exercise
   * Been doing pushups and body-weight squats as well as walking, but been having trouble consistently hitting 10k steps a day.  Looking to add more body weight or gym exercise to my routine as well as walking more.  I like the way I'm starting to look.
* Still taking vitamins and getting electrolytes.  Think I was low on potassium and have added more foods that help with that (chicken breast, avocado, etc.). Seems to help with the very minor cramping I've faced.
* Still feeling good.  My results are staring to show and my mood is good overall.
* I have a physical next month.  Very curious what my numbers will be.
* Still going strong.  No plans to stop on my ketogenic journey.  Hope you all are well!",1761833973.0,45,3,keto,diet

I'm new to the keto diet. I chose keto because I don't have much time to do cardio or HIIT, so I want to control my weight mainly through diet.

1ojyrn9,One year keto,"I recently passed one year on keto. My Mother has schizophrenia, thankfully I do not. But I have just about all of the negative symptoms and have struggled with depression and anxiety for years. I started fasting a couple of years ago and felt quite good when doing so and I learned later down the road about keto. I read so many success stories of keto helping mental illness after everything else had failed and was very encouraged. I haven't had the results that I want. I struggle with severe anxiety, which I think is why I get depressed. If i could get past the anxiety, I think I would get where I want to be. Being so anxious, makes being social miserable. I do it at work because I have to be and I think I do well. But outside of work, I am quite isolated. I don't have friends and I don't have any family to be a support system. I'm usually around 1mmol ketones and my glucose is around 75-90 depending on when I test. I'm coming here to just ask people who have maybe done it longer than me or had more success. Am I missing something? Do i need higher ketones? It's quite frustrating to do all the ""right"" things aka keto, eight hours of sleep, exercise two or three times a week. I don't do drugs, i have tried to force myself into social situations, but i always end up back in my house alone. I think when you are uncomfortable and dont really feel right in social settings, its hard to connect with anyone because they can sense your unease. 

  
I've been fighting this fight a long time and I really hoped that keto was the key. I was encouraged early on, i stopped biting my nails without even trying, but it was short lived. I want to live a full life, with friends and family. I work really hard and at first glance have the things you'd want. An ok job, a house, couple cars. But working so hard and trying so much just to not really share life with anyone is pretty glum. If anyone has any tips on where I might be missing it, I'd appreciate the feedback.

1ojrfau,Why cant i get fat adapted?!,"Ive been keto strict for just over 3 months and im still seeing a lot of ketones in my urine and getting weak from hunger, and putting on weight! I had the longest electrolyte adjustment period and still struggling with it despite adding sodium, magnesium and potassium to my water. I exercise lightly, aim for a 3:1 fat to protein ratio and keep carbs under 20g. I gave up coffee this week in an attempt to help my electrolyte balance as it blocks absorption of magnesium and i dont need the extra diarrhetic at this point.

It just looks like if I cut sugar and carbs there isnt anything that will bring me uo to enough calories without bassically shoveling food into my mouth half the day and cooking the other half. It just doesnt look feasible.

After a couple months off Keto, I started again 4 days ago and am struggling with fatigue. I heavily salt, usually take one LMNT per day, and just ordered some LiteSalt to help with potassium (along with some nuts/seeds high in this). I was on high dose prednisone for a week just prior to re-starting Keto due to a herniated disc, so I feel like I’ve lost even more water than usual (25lbs since stopping the prednisone - I didn’t weigh the day I started Keto, but soooo many trips to the loo). I’ve dealt with some Keto “flu” before, but the fatigue is pretty extreme - which I hate because I love the energizing aspect of Keto as it helps with my depression.

I have a yearly doc appt next week and will check in there (though I typically get pushback about Keto from most medical ppl) and will get a full blood work up.

1oj9ptq,Keto again. How I got back," I was on keto for 7 years. My purpose has always been to reverse diabetes. At the beginning I lost 32 lbs, and my A1C which was in the diabetic range went to prediabetic and then normal. I started keto by making a set of 3x5 cards. Each had on them one positive or negative about doing keto. For example, ""I will be less likely to develop heart disease,"" and ""I will lose weight."" I had probably 30 cards. Everytime I sat down to eat, I turned off all distractions and went through the cards before starting. Then I ate slowly and my focus was on eating, not on my phone or anything like that. That was very effective, because my whole family is diabetic and having big heart issues, and I still had a calcium score of zero. So I knew the negatives and positives I had on those cards were true. Once I was down to a size 6, I had to raise my carbs to up to 100 a day, so as not to continue weight loss, but still maintained ketosis most of the time. The final year or two were trickier because all the new ""keto"" foods that weren't really keto interfered. It was very tempting to eat keto bread and keto protein bars aka candy bars. So I was on a slippery slope. I found myself going in and out of ketosis more often as a result. Then I went out of the country for a few days and had basically no control over my food, except not to eat, as I was with a group and not on my own. I was not prepared to fast for that long, but tried to avoid carbs, or at least eat limited amounts. Unfortunately, rice, beans, plantains, and very little meat meant I was way out of ketosis pretty fast. My blood sugar was way up too. When I came back home, I decided to take a break from keto, having gotten so lazy it almost didn't seem like keto, just to see what would happen. I stayed off keto about 10 months although I originally thought I would do it just for a month. During that time I still preferred low carb, avoiding pasta, etc. and did not eat sugar, but I did use keto foods that were less than ideal, including maintaining my sweet tooth with plenty of fake sugar. I tried to restart keto a few times during that ten months, but was never successful over a few days. During that time I just didn't get into ketosis easily, and eating the slightest amount of carbs would make my blood sugar go higher than ever I had experienced it. It looked like I'd never be able to get back my keto advantage. If that happens to you, you just have to keep going, because it will calm down after a while, and blood sugars will normalize. My A1C, by the way climbed back into the prediabetic range and I very gradually regained 10 lbs. Recently I successfully got back on keto. I had to sit down and have a stern talk with myself about the danger of possible diabetic related effects such as heart disease, amputations, blindness, kidney disease, and a host of other things. Then I made myself a little sign reminding myself of this, ending with ""Every bite counts."" I put it on my kitchen counter where I still look at it every time I eat. It is so easy to say ""just this one time"" I will make an exception, but I stopped that. For me, a carbaholic, it was like an alcoholic saying ""Just one beer and I'll stop."" Every bite really does count for me.  Limiting myself to 20 to 50 carbs worked for me for restarting. (I am able to maintain ketosis on 100 carbs, although not everyone can do that.) First week results were: re-losing  7 lbs and normalizing my blood sugar at last. Yes, I know it is mostly water weight, but that's how it starts. Weight loss continues. I'm once again in ketosis. Sadly I did experience a lot of thirst and fatigue ""Keto flu,""  even though carefully making sure I was adding electrolytes to my diet. I'm not having so much difficulty maintaining now, and am confident I can continue keto as a lifestyle again. It's finally feeling like putting on some old comfortable shoes. It's pretty easy again.  The biggest thing to overcome was my own rationalization that just this one meal would be okay and I can start tomorrow. Also, overcoming the discouragement of not instantly being in ketosis again, and having unwarranted high blood sugars. Once I'm back at my normal weight I will slowly transition up to 100 carbs a day, monitoring that to be sure I can still stay in ketosis with that. That's how I returned.

1oj2ni5,My keto journey,"Hi! 

I don't know if anyone cares, but I want to share my keto story! 

In november last year I weighed 100kg (my height is 1.70m). I was 26 at the time. I didn't know that it had gotten to that point as I refused to weigh myself and I kept telling myself that I was doing good and losing weight, despite not doing anything.

I was in denial, most of all. Most days I didn't eat much, and what I ate was very bad for me, which caused me to gain so much weight. I felt like I tried every diet and just gave up at one point, thinking that it might be thyroid issues. The fact is, I never tried hard enough.. 

When the scale hit 100kg I decided change needed to be made. I felt so embarrassed that I was 100kg! Still it was hard for me to pick a diet and start right away. Especially because Christmas was around the corner!

On January 1st I started keto and my life has improved so much! I started losing weight quite fast which made it easier for me to keep it up. I even maintained it on holidays (which was very hard because of the limited options abroad). 

It is now almost nov 1st and I am proud to say that I am 2kg away from my goal weight, which is 70kg. In these 10 months I lost 30kg and I couldn't be happier! My mental health is better, I am more confident, people don't ignore me anymore now that I am no longer the fat friend, I feel attractive... 

Keto is hard, but once to get used to it, it is a lifestyle that you don't want to go without! For me at least.. Keto made me realise what I want to put in my body and what I want to avoid. 

For those who are doubting, I hope this will help you start this new and healthy lifestyle!",1761739412.0,72,15,keto,diet

( I know weight loss is not linear) but this week the calendar been yoyoing a couple lbs between 175 and 177 (no change to food intake) and Im wondering if the reason might have to do with the crazy constipation im feeling and the fact that I havent has a damn shit in days!!!!!

1oiulnl,I’m never thirsty?,"Before switching to keto, I was a heavy drinker and fast food addict, regularly consuming ~4,000 calories per day. Not surprisingly, I would usually drink around two liters of water/day. 

I’m now eight weeks into the keto diet, and I’ve been eating nothing but meat and vegetables (broccoli, asparagus, radishes, bok choy, collard greens,mushrooms), and I eat one large avocado per day. My calorie intake is around ~1,800 a day and I only eat between 11:30am and 5:30pm. Steamed broccoli, eggs and avocado every morning, followed by something like 8oz chicken breast and a big bowl of greens or mixed veggies for dinner. 

I’ve lost 46 pounds so far, and here’s the crazy part: I never feel thirsty, like ever. I pee every few hours, always clear, never dark and I honestly have no idea how I’m staying hydrated. Is it because I’m eating so many vegetables? Do natural foods just contain that much more water than the processed shit I was consuming before?",1761709839.0,24,17,keto,diet

I did 3 days of ketovore just to try and get as close to 0 carbs as possible. I figured it would help kick things off.

I’ve been tracking my calories and macros and realized I’m probably eating too much protein and not enough fat so I increased my fat intake (more bacon, butter, etc.). Still not in ketosis (per the strips).

I’m eating in a calorie deficit (not a large one), sticking very strictly to keto and working out. Am I missing something?

You’re fully in ketosis but have no energy, mental clarity, and can feel depressed. Curious if anyone else has experienced this.

1oiq11n,"Update: labs, dr visit, and continued success","I posted here a little while ago. Someone asked me to keep them updated when I got my lab results. 

I embarked on a keto lifestyle at the end of June. I’m a 55-year-old woman, 5’3”. Starting weight according to my doctor was 223. I’m now 189 on my scale and also on hers. I’ve been losing about 2 pounds a week on average.

More importantly, my A1c dropped from one point below being diagnosed diabetic to one point above not being prediabetic anymore. Doctor told me I don’t need to take metformin, which I had put off starting when I began eating keto. Thrilled about that! My cholesterol is looking about the same and triglycerides are down into the normal range. Blood pressure also is normal. Visceral fat and overall fat is down. Basically, metabolic syndrome is now in my past! I was seriously considering getting weight loss shots and even thought about bariatric surgery. I’m so glad I didn’t go down those paths.

Since starting keto:

- My energy is much better, and I’m finally taking care of household tasks that have been stacking up for ages and ages. 

- As somebody with bipolar disorder, I’ve had no depression and more stability. I actually feel happy! (But not manic.) I continue taking a mood stabilizer but have almost no breakthrough symptoms.

- I no longer take medication for ADHD, and I feel more focused. I’m reading more sophisticated books again. And I'm better able to hold an intellectual conversation.

- The severe GERD I've had for about 14 years has mostly disappeared. I’m not scared of impending esophageal cancer or needing surgery.

 - I’ve dropped two clothing sizes, no longer needing to shop in the plus size department. I’ve been enjoying buying new clothes for the first time in ages. (I’m buying them secondhand, because I anticipate that I’ll be shrinking out of them in the future!) 

- I can see my body changing shape and my horrible double chin disappearing.

- My self-confidence is better than it has been for about 12 years. 

- Food tastes better and isn’t a compulsion.

- Even going to the bathroom is more comfortable. Lol.

It’s hard to believe that keto has had such a huge impact on almost every area of my life. This is definitely a permanent change, not just a diet. You better believe I’m never going back to processed food, carb hell, compulsive eating, self-induced poor health and hopelessness. I’m excited to see how my life, body and mind continue to change for the better. 😁",1761696723.0,30,4,keto,diet

I've heard that some people experience a spike in blood sugar due to the modified starch but I didn't have that issue. I also adored the taste, it felt like I wasn't on a diet at all. To put it into perspective, I had days where I would only eat sandwiches with that bread apart from snacks.

1oig4su,I'm only 79% here... my experience on keto as a middle-aged obese woman,"I'm only part-way through my journey, but wanted to document my success (so far) with the ketogenic diet in case others in similar situations are looking for hope or inspiration. 

**TLDR**: I've lost 70+ lbs and have recovered a quality of life I didn't think was possible.

**Keys to my success:**

* Eating less than 20 net carbs each day, and staying on top of electrolytes.
* Tracking calories, and trying to stay under 1600. I have higher days somewhat regularly… I know this will eventually cause me to stall, but I'll just my intake when I reach that point.
* No cheat days. If I have a craving, I have to find a keto version that is “good enough.”  
* Making as much food at home as possible, including making food from scratch using whole foods instead of mixes, boxes, and prepackaged stuff. 
* If I overeat something, I don’t make it or buy it again. Keto has reduced a lot of cravings and helped with my willpower, but I don’t want to have to fight temptation all the time.
* Supportive family. They aren’t exclusively keto, but they do their best not to undermine my progress or introduce trigger foods into our home environment. 

**About me, before keto:**

* American woman in my mid-40s, mother of three, height of 5’11”. 
* Morbidly obese for my entire adult life, with about 12 of those years being above 300 lbs. 
* Absolute sugar addict. Desserts followed all three meals. Loved pre-packaged, easy to grab/prepare foods. 
* Everything in my body hurt. My knees were swollen and disfigured, my legs puffy. I had a hard time walking or standing for any meaningful length of time–even running into a convenience store or standing long enough to cook a meal was difficult. I was in physical therapy for months, trying to reduce the pain, but I still relied on Tylenol to get through almost every day. 
* Vision changes indicated insulin resistance (according to my optometrist), although my fasting glucose and A1C numbers were NOT high enough to be considered pre-diabetic. 
* Major GERD, relying on omeprazole (dr prescribed) for over 11 years. Chronic cough due to the reflux.
* Distended, bloated stomach for days whenever I would eat veggies/fiber. Even something as simple as an apple caused me significant discomfort. A salad could mess me up for days.
* Diagnosis of binge eating disorder, and couldn’t make it through two hours without needing to eat something. 
* Lengthy history of yo-yo dieting on historically popular low-fat CICO diets (Weight Watchers, etc). You know the ones: Fat and sodium *bad*. Endless fruits and calorie restriction *good*. I was constantly trying to diet or lose weight, but every failure made it harder and harder to start the next time. 
* Very difficult to find clothes that fit–all had to be ordered online from specialty stores. Coats and jackets couldn’t be zipped. Felt terrible about how I looked.
* My doctor suggested weight loss surgery, but after I learned more about it, I decided it wasn’t for me since I was pretty sure I could out-eat whatever changes were made to my body. Since I’m not diabetic, I didn’t qualify for the other weight loss drugs unless I wanted to pay thousands out of pocket.
* Anxious, hopeless, out of control.

**Since starting keto 9 months ago:**

* As of today, I've lost 21% of my body weight, the equivalent of more than 70 lbs) since starting keto, and am the lightest I’ve been in 15+ years. I've lost 8"" off my waist, 9"" off my hips. Still a long way to go to reach a healthy weight, but I’m really happy with the progress.
* Keto is more sustainable for me than the CICO diets. After years of low-fat diets, eating food with fat and flavor is very satisfying. If I want something in particular, I can find a keto-friendly alternative. I don’t have to wrangle myself to stay on it every day, it’s easy and second nature at this point. I want to keep doing it because I feel good.
* My swollen and disfigured knees look almost normal, and have very minimal pain now. Water retention/swelling in all my limbs is gone. I can walk 2.5 miles or more–it’s been *years* since I could do that. I can do the grocery shopping again. I rarely take Tylenol. Overall tremendous reduction in pain levels.
* I have been able to walk into stores and buy clothes that fit off the rack--even bras! It's insane!! My new jacket zips up. I have gone from a size 32 to a size 18... 4XL-5XL to 1 XL. I have renewed self confidence in my appearance and abilities. 
* My vision changes have largely stabilized, indicating my insulin resistance is improving. Glucose numbers on my ketomojo back that up. I don’t think I’m at the finish line yet, but I’m definitely better.
* After trying to wean myself off for years, I am finally off the omeprazole for real! I even have days without heartburn! The chronic cough is 99% gone–but still flares up if I eat too much in a single meal. 
* My stomach has flattened considerably. I find that since I’m not stuffed all the time, I can eat the smaller servings of vegetables that keto allows without the same bloat problem. I do have to drink tons of water every day or I risk becoming constipated. I can’t really eat the keto breads and tortillas without experiencing a lot of bloat. 
* I do not meet the criteria for binge eating disorder now, and find I can go many, many hours without eating between meals. I don’t snack anymore. I don’t miss sugar. A few macadamia nuts, a nice piece of cheese, or even just chamomile tea with lemon for dessert is perfect. 
* My hopelessness is gone! I feel empowered--keto has been better for me than any prescription.",1761673452.0,475,93,keto,diet

My question comes is how it impacts my body and fat burning immediately after taking and within the next few hours.  What exactly is it doing in my body?  I’m only taking 4-5ml about 15 mins before my evening CrossFit. 

I will also say it is likely the most disgusting thing I have ever had, and the taste takes 15 minutes to leave your mouth, even if you try to rinse it out with something else.

I made all the mistakes (most recent one, eating too much salad with my protein - it really seems to up the carbs and doesn’t decrease my appetite). Now my appetite is really reduced and I can really eat one or 2 small meals a day comfortably which are most people’s size of a snack. 
The problem is, at the same time, I’m working with a physio to build up muscles around my knees and taking magnesium and creatine supplements. I really love long distance running and due to lack of strength in my knees, I haven’t been able to run for 5 years (before this, used to run marathons). 
My menopause doctor says that you need to eat protein in smaller amounts to absorb it properly and for it to be effective in maintaining muscle growth as you age. Is this true? Is a larger amount of protein in one meal just as good? I struggle to eat breakfast and would need to force feed myself anything in the morning so best I could do is the 2 serves of protein in the 2 small meals I eat in the day. Should I force myself to do 3? I would really love to be able to do just one",1761533611.0,10,11,keto,diet

1ogarzy,Lipid panel results after 18mos on keto,"I’ve been following the keto diet for the last 18 months. I just got my annual bloodwork back and my husband and I were stunned. Wanted to share the results especially for folks new to keto or are worried about the impact of this diet on your cholesterol. 


The tl;dr is: I reduced carbs and my total cholesterol, triglycerides, and VLDL all tanked. 


Background: my pre-keto diet was whole-food based but very grain and plant-based. Think: oatmeal with fruit for breakfast, beans+veg soup/stew for lunch, pasta/grains with dinner. Fruits for afternoon snacks. Popcorn dessert/snack. Homemade bread… I thought it was healthy because it was low-fat and didn’t involve processed foods, but it was very high carb. 


I’m a peri-menopausal woman who started to experience weight gain and inflammation (hello frozen shoulder). I read the book “Women, Food, and Hormones” and that led me to this diet, which has worked well for me. 


Here are my lipid panel results for the last four years. 2022 and 2023 align to my pre-keto diet. 2024 is about 5 months after starting keto. 2025 is 17 months in.

1og1liz,"7 Days into Keto, steady but tired","Hey folks,
Figured I’d share where I’m at and maybe get some perspective from people who’ve been through this.

So it’s been about a week since I started Keto, and honestly, it’s been one hell of an adjustment.
I’m Indian, which means carbs are everywhere. Chapati, rice, dal, poha, even our so-called “healthy” snacks, there’s just no escaping them here. 😅
But I cut them all out completely. No chapati, no rice, no bread, no sugar.

Now my plate looks like this: chicken, eggs, vegetables, and fat (olive oil, butter, ghee, the good stuff).
I’m also training consistently, calisthenics and cardio in the morning (handstand practice, mobility work, skipping), and weight training in the evening (basic push/pull/legs).

Before keto, my workouts felt solid. Now, I can tell my strength is down a bit, I fatigue faster, and heavy sets feel heavier than they should.
Still, my energy through the day is surprisingly stable. No hunger pangs, no sugar crashes.

I checked my blood glucose today, it was 133 mg/dL two hours after eating out (prawns black pepper from a restaurant), and then 85 mg/dL a couple of hours later.
That felt like a win, honestly. Before keto, my sugar would’ve stayed high for hours.

So yeah, physically, I’m steady but tired.
Mentally, I feel sharp and kind of proud that I’ve stuck with this for 7 days straight in a place where every street corner smells like fried carbs. 😅

For context, I’m 25, 5'4"", 64 kg, diabetic + hypertension (on Telma 20).
This isn’t a “diet phase” for me, it’s part of trying to reverse years of messed-up eating, alcoholism, chainsmoking (I have already quit everything back in February) and rebuild my health from the ground up.

I guess I’m posting this to ask,
does this tired-but-steady phase sound familiar to those who’ve been through keto adaptation?
When did your strength and stamina come back?
And if you’re from India or any carb-heavy food culture, how do you deal with the social and practical side of this diet?

One week in.

1of4c0m,Doing great on keto but worried I might be missing something — advice?,"Hey everyone,

*- TLDR at the bottom :)*

I just wanted to share my current keto routine and see if im on the right track or if there is anything I could/should improve. Things have been going great for me, but sometimes I worry I might be missing something.

**About me:**  
M, 31, 180cm. Started at around **140kg (\~308lbs)** about a year ago. For the first 6-9 months, I mainly focused on cleaning up my diet and cutting out soda, which got me down to about **120-125kg (\~265-275lbs).**

About 4 months ago (or 5? don't know.. not so important), I started Keto. At first I experimented a bit, but honestly, I am a simple guy. I like things easy and consistent (like my 3 Pizza's a day 1-2years ago :) ). I am now deep into a routine with both diet and exercise and it is working really well for me.

**My current routine:** 

* Gym: 3-4x per week
* Running: 3-4x per week (\~10km / \~6miles each time)
* Biking: 2x per week
* Sometimes stretching, but thats just a side note.

**Current weight: 95kg (\~210lbs).** Definitely no longer fat obese and feeling much fitter, though I still have some body fat to lose..

# Now for the main point - my food.

I eat the exact same thing every day. Like a dog. So I call my meal ""Dog Food v2"" (v2 because I added more cheese at some point :D)

Here’s the daily recipe:

* 400g ground beef (\~14 oz)
* 7 eggs
* 125g mozzarella (\~4.4 oz)
* 150g leek (\~5.3 oz)
* 250g bell pepper (red, yellow, orange - f green) (\~8.8 oz)
* 125g Emmental cheese (\~4.4 oz)
* 10g chili pepper (\~0.35 oz)
* A few spices

(Sorry if the weights in ounces makes no sense. Some random calc told me that)

Thats it. My entire daily intake.  
**Total: \~2300kcal - 162g fat, 29g carbs (13g fiber -> 16g net carbs), 180g protein.**  
I eat twice a day, around 12:00 and 18/19:00.  
  
In the morning i take my supplements: Creatin, Omega3, Magnesium, Electrolytes, Multi vitamine, vitamine d3/k2.

**It is super easy and effective. But..should it be this simple? Am I doing anything wrong by eating the same thing every day? Are there things I should rotate or add for long-term balance? Any tips?**

1of42lj,Are the 20g of carbs for everyone?,"Last year I did keto for like a month and it lowered my A1C quickly + it made my body look soooo good. However, I used to indulge in chocolate and chips every like 4 days (oops) but that didn't seem to ruin my results or anything.

1of24v9,Second time doing keto/ketovore. Not working the same this time?,"Hi everyone,

I'm just so frustrated and wondering if there's something I'm missing. 31 y/o 5'7 female 195 lbs. 2.5 years ago I started this diet at 182 lbs and was down to 155 in about 3 months. I lost weight steadily the entire time from literally like day 1, never went up on the scale even a little bit. It was amazing and worked so fast, I felt incredible and hardly had to put any effort in at all it seemed.

Well after those 3 months I completely fell off the wagon and gained all the weight back in the past 2 years plus nearly 15 additional pounds. I decided enough was enough and I am going ketovore again. I am 3 weeks in and i haven't lost a single pound, in fact I initially went up .5 lbs and I just keep losing and regaining that half a pound every other day. This is completely different from last time and it's making me feel crazy. Especially considering the fact that I am being WAY more strict this time, not only am I doing keto, I'm counting calories and doing IF as well. I eat two meals a day plus my coffee with heavy cream, I'm averaging around 1300-1400 calories a day. I drink nearly 180 oz of water daily (about 30 of which I add LMNT), taking calcium and magnesium supplements, as well as Vitd3. I try to focus on high healthy fats and moderate protein, and I know for a fact I'm not going over 20g carbs on any given day.

My sleep is also awful this time around. I just don't get it. This is completely opposite of my first experience with this WOE in which last time it was like a miracle worker, and again I wasn't even tracking calories back then, I basically lived off brisket and ribs and even still drank low carb alcohol, whereas this time around I have cut out all alcohol completely as well, and still I'm getting nowhere at all.

At this point, I'm wondering if it's something I'm doing wrong, or if I should start considering talking to a doctor? I know I've obviously gotten older since last time I did this, but this just seems ridiculous... can 2 years really have that much impact on my body and metabolism? Any advice or tips appreciated.

I'm only 4 days into the transition, I'm hitting my targets and I prefer to eat at lunch time rather than in the evening (I don't like such a big meal in my stomach before bed).
I'm trying to move to OMAD mostly to try to help stay under the calorie limit to aid weight loss. 

The problem is that by evening I'm hungry, and I'm waking up hungry in the morning and staying hungry until i eat again at lunch time. This doesn't happen with 2MAD (which are usually mid morning and mid afternoon) when I am rarely hungry. 

My question is.... is this normal for transitioning to OMAD, and if I ride it out it might pass? Or does it mean something isn't working right for me and I need to tweak or re-evaluate?",1761297719.0,12,22,keto,diet

- My macro goals are 5% carbs, 30% protein & 65% fat with a 1400 calorie goal. So for carbs it’s 18.8 g at most. 
I’ve been staying under 20 for the past week by counting net carbs but legit can’t tell if I’m ketosis or not.

1oemear,Don't sleep on beef stroganoff,"Hey everyone,

I've been part of this community on and off for years. A lot has changed since I have had a proper revamp on keto. Namely, I have a wife and daughter. Luckily, I have a supportive wife who does not mind trimming her carbs or eating low carb meals. Meat and veggies are an absolute staple. 

That being said. I can no longer simply throw out all the carbs in the house. Doesn't work like that anymore. I digress, finding low carb meals and/or slight edits to make meals low carb has been very fun for me (I'm the main cook of the family). I had a go at butter chicken last week (8/10 would recommend) and this week has been beef stroganoff. I completely forgot that dish even existed. Everything about it is low carb and it's insanely good. I'm not a keto purist so the recipe I used calls for 1 tbs of flour, which has 6g of carbs, and I did not skip that step. 

My wife prefers to eat the mushrooms and I don't like the texture. I took half the cooked mushrooms and immersion blended them with beef stock and then just put the mushrooms back with her portions. I poured my stroganoff over green beans. Given it a try, you won't regret it. 

The recipe isn't anything special, literally the first one on Google. Here it is if you want it - https://natashaskitchen.com/beef-stroganoff/",1761273494.0,201,53,keto,diet

1odqt41,Is keto good for growth spurt?,"I’m 20.5 years old and currently in a bit of a late growth spurt — I’ve grown about 10 cm in the last 6 months. I’ve been strict keto for a while now since it gives me peak strength, mental clarity, and productivity, but I’ve been wondering how it might affect growth factors like IGF-1 and ultimately my growth potential.

From what I’ve read:

* Keto diets can lower insulin and IGF-1 levels, which could potentially reduce growth signaling.
* On the other hand, lower inflammation, better sleep, and stable energy levels might indirectly support growth.
* Some people mention using targeted or cyclical keto (TKD/CKD) to periodically reintroduce carbs to restore IGF-1 sensitivity or refill glycogen.

So I’m curious — for someone in a late growth spurt trying to maximize natural height, would you:

1. Stay fully keto and rely on high-quality protein + sleep + micronutrients, or
2. Introduce carb periods (e.g., once a week / every few days) to bump up IGF-1 and anabolic signaling?",1761183837.0,4,6,keto,diet

1ocu7rh,Lost 66lbs but gained it back after losing my way,"Hello everyone,

Back in 2020, at 15 years old and 105kg, I successfully used the keto diet and light exercise to get down to 75kg in about six months. I was incredibly proud and maintained a healthy weight of 80-84kg for the next 2.5 years while starting to build a better physique at the gym.

Unfortunately, around early 2023, things started to slide. I picked up a bad smkn habit in 2022 that gradually took over, causing my discipline to fade and the weight to creep back on. By April 2023, I was 93kg and eventually stopped checking the scale altogether. This habit became a daily struggle, and I feel like I lost myself in the process.

I'm now 20, and four weeks ago I weighed in at 104kg (231 lbs) at 5'8"". I've found new motivation and have been hitting the gym consistently for the past month (lifting 6x a week plus cardio). Now that my training is consistent, I want to re-integrate the keto diet that worked so well for me before.

I'm posting to seek some wisdom and advice on two fronts:

1. For anyone who has successfully overcome a persistent, unhealthy smkn habit while on a fitness journey, what strategies personally worked for you to stay on track?
2. Given my stats and intense workout schedule, what would be a good starting point for calories and macros on a keto diet? I previously had success with under 20g of carbs and 1,000-1,400 calories, but I'm open to advice on what's sustainable now that I'm lifting seriously.

for starters, i’m pretty big currently- i’m 5’6 and 240lb. i just want to lose weight so i have more energy and so that i don’t have to worry about it or have it come up constantly in conversation. can someone with a starting weight as large as me do keto? anyway, i’ve been eating pretty strict to the diet as far as i know. steak, fish, cheeses, eggs, nothing that has above 2g carbs on the packaging pretty much. but i feel perfectly fine other than some cravings. is that normal?

i’ve been going to the gym too, every other day. light cardio and weight lifting.

Keto (low carb I guess because I allow myself some fruit every once in a while around training), has brought my BP down to normal levels.

I was running 140-150/80s-90s for practically no reason as a fit athelete.

As soon as I cut carbs my BP went to normal range basically immediately… I have no clue how, I think has something to do with insulin resistance increasing the amount of sodium the kidneys retain.

I’m seeing my blood pressure around 115/60-125/70s now and it seems like it’s still trending lower. (This is while maintaining high sodium and electrolyte intake).

1o9x5c7,10 year update,"I first heard about keto/low carb in 2015 while listening to a podcast with Mark Sisson. I decided to give it a try and ended up losing ~50lbs in 6 months. I had struggled with my weight my entire life, fluctuating greatly over the years but never able to keep it consistent. Keto seemed like a magic trick for me. I stuck to strict keto (<20 carbs) for roughly 3 years (2015-2018). I had practiced BJJ since 2008 but decided to start taking it serious in 2018. I noticed my energy levels during training were low so decided to add some carbs on training days but always below 50g per day and still avoiding bread and white sugar. Around that time I learned about fasting and used that as a tool to keep my weight consistent as well. Generally doing a 40 hour fast once a week (Sunday to Tuesday). This worked out well up until 2022 when I ramped up my training and started dropping weight again. In 2023 I competed at 168lbs and while I was able to see success I realized it was too low of a weight class for my frame. In fact my wife had made a comment about how I no longer had an ass 😅🤣 and that was the last straw. What happened next was unexpected. I had a very tough time putting weight back on. Seems that years of keto and fasting had changed my system so much that I was in the opposite position than I started back in 2015. I worked with a sport nutritionalist and reworked my diet and training schedule. I increased my protein, quit long fasts and increased my carbs. Most days I still keep my carbs under 100g and I do intermittent fasting on Saturdays and Sundays. I’m currently around 188lbs, lift 4-5 days a week and train BJJ 8-10 hours per week.

1o8rkht,Keto isn't really helping my mental health.,"I have been on the ketogenic diet for four months, with intermittent fasting for 18 hours and sometimes two days. Only keto with two days of fasting makes me feel better, but overall my anxiety and lack of concentration are as bad as before.

I lost 15kg, but I haven't lost any weight in a month and I am still overweight.

Besides losing weight, the only benefit to my health has been more energy. Before, I only worked out for an hour, but now I can do more than two hours if I want to.

Total cholesterol 280
HDL: 37

Total Cholesterol: 402
HDL: 39
LDL: 341
Triglycerides: 111
VLDL: 22

I get my fats from olive oil, coconut oil, almonds, walnuts, fish, steak, chicken thigh, cheddar cheese, eggs, chia seeds, hemp. I am taking Electrolytes, sea salt, vitamin  b. Every day have big salad with Apple cider vinegar, balsamic, and olive oil with berries. I have been using ketone sticks to track. No alcohol.  I go between 1-2 meals a day. So from 18-23hr fasts.

1. Open Gemini or ChatGPT.
2. Start a new Chat
3. Copy and paste / customize the prompt below and submit it
4. As you eat throughout the day, just tell it what you ate and how much.  Include more details from the label if you have it, or just let it estimate as best as it can.

\---Prompt----

Help me track my food consumption and the estimated calories, protein, carbs, fiber, and fat.  

Build this table 

* The rows are the foods and quantities that I tell you I am eating.  
* Add one column for each of these things - calories, protein, carbs, fiber and fat.  
* Throughout the day I will tell you the food and quantity I eat.  
* Each time I do, you will update the table by adding a new row.  
* Keep all of the rows from the prior table. 
* At the bottom, total each of the columns.  

Also, if I say that I drank a **smoothie**, use these ingredients and quantities: 

* Water
* 5mg Creatine 
* Protein powder: 165 calories, 21g of protein, 0 mg cholesterol, 390mg sodium, 8g dietary fiber, 1g total sugar
* 1 cup raw Spinach
* 1/2 medium Banana
* 3/4 cup Greek Yogurt: plain, low fat, 16g protein, 120 calories
* Ginger root  

If I say I had a **whey protein drink**, use these nutritional facts: 120 calories, 1g total fat, 30mg cholesterol, 65mg sodium, fiber <1g, 25g protein.

If I say I had a **pea protein drink**, use these nutritional facts: 165 calories, 21g of protein, 0 mg cholesterol, 390mg sodium, 8g dietary fiber, 1g total sugar 1g)

Do they not list the specifics because they cannot accurately get the right numbers because of the processing it goes through, but it’s still there and they’re covering themselves by just leaving it off the nutritional facts?

For lunch I usually have some sort of brown bread with hummus, cheese, cucumber, maybe a banana. Peper and salt. Ajvar. Sometimes eggs. 

For dinner I usually make wraps, shakshouka, a quick salad or a soup.

1q7601w,Are smoothies good for a sugar detox?,"Since the start of the month, I’ve been attempting to do a sugar detox. This was mostly for added sugars. I haven’t had any sweets and the only sugar (besides the smoothie recipe below) I’ve had was in the form of creamer once by accident. That is all to say maybe I ate something that contained a small amount and I didn’t realize it. 

I was drinking this smoothie recipe to cope but then I remembered that broken down and blended fruits basically turn into added sugar. I wanted to see if this makes any difference. Keep in mind too, this smoothie basically substitutes a meal and I intermediate fast. 

Smoothie contents
1 avocado (ran out recently)
1 banana (2 sometimes because I ran out of avocados)
3 handfuls of blueberries
1-2 spoonfuls of pomegranate
1-3 handfuls of spinach (what the recipe normally calls for, only bought it again yesterday and was not including it)
1-2 handfuls of walnuts
1-2 big spoonfuls of zero sugar Greek yogurt
Raw honey (probably what negates the whole detox, only included because it is supposed to help with skin but nixing it for the rest of the detox)
Ginger
Turmeric
Black pepper
Garlic (sometimes)
Oregano (sometimes)
Coffee (sometimes)
Water
Ice

Basically, should I be starting from square one? What should I not include? Should I switch to yogurt bowls instead in order to prevent higher sugar intake? I do not have any sugar cravings probably due to the fact that the honey and fruits are fulfilling that spot.


Edit - thank you for the responses! I am looking to reduce sugar intake and eliminate added sugar for the most part. Fruits and dairy (only milk, cheese, and yogurt/sour cream) are the one’s I am consuming because they are natural.

My fear I guess was I read somewhere that blended fruit can act like added sugar and be absorbed faster and act like I consumed more than I actually did. ",1767859171.0,0,24,nutrition,diet

1q6hx0u,One drink started my wellness journey,"Quitting junk food is a hard addiction to kick. I consulted a health specialist who told me to try one new thing every month. Something small. 

  
My first change was a ginger, turmeric, apple cider vinegar, lemon drink. I drink it right when I wake up. Here's what I can tell you. 

  
It works. After one week, I felt a decline in the junkfood cravings meter of arround 20%. After four weeks, I cut my junk food intake by almost 80%. 

  
The real reason is that I finally felt that I was doing something positive, and my guilt wouldn't let me eat the junk food. 

  
The guilt turned into progress, which turned into a full lifestyle change. One change per month is truly the only way to make a wellness change. 

  
Don't try to be a hero from day one. It's impossible. Make one change every month, something small, something that happens in the morning. The morning change allows you to have a day full of gratitude for your one small change. 

  
2 years later, I work out 5 days per week, eat only organic, wear organic clothing, no harmful chemicals in my house. I took a deep dive into a healthy life, and it's the best choice I've ever made.

At first I neglected to pre-soak the seeds, and they just ducked up all the liquid in the oats, making it really gloopy and hard to eat.

Last couple of nights I've soaked them in advance until they gelled, then mixed them in, which has brought me too far in the opposite direction, making the whole thing too liquid. If I didn't make it myself, next morning I could swear there's no oats in there at all.

1q2z92m,Soylent protein: Not the same product anymore — noticeable quality drop,"I’m posting this as a final, complete account after weeks of back-and-forth with Soylent.

I relied on Soylent Cacao Powder for nearly two years. The earlier version was genuinely good — rich, creamy, and something I actually enjoyed using. The most recent tubs I purchased are materially different: noticeably thinner, diluted, and far less flavorful. This is not a subtle change. Side-by-side use makes it obvious.

There was no notice, no disclosure, and no labeling update. Same version designation, same packaging, but a different product.

This is not just my personal impression. There are many similar reports online from other customers describing the same degradation, which strongly suggests this is not a one-off batch issue or subjective taste.

What makes this worse is Soylent’s long-standing inventory and communication problems. For years, products have disappeared without explanation, cacao pouches vanished entirely, and the “back in stock” notification system has never worked in my experience. I signed up multiple times and never once received an alert.

I spent weeks communicating with Soylent support, provided photos, lot codes, and detailed explanations, and was repeatedly told the issue would be escalated and “gotten to the bottom of.” The final response was a $25 goodwill credit, with no acknowledgement of a quality issue, no explanation, and no assurance that anything is being fixed.

For context, I live outside the U.S. and ship through a freight forwarder, which makes retailer returns unrealistic. That makes transparency even more important, otherwise customers are left with unusable product and no real recourse.

This was never about getting money back. I would have preferred a clear explanation and assurance that quality control or sourcing issues were being addressed. Instead, it feels like the company is unwilling to acknowledge a systemic problem and is using small credits to close tickets.

Between the unexplained quality degradation, unreliable availability, and lack of transparency, I’ve lost confidence in the brand. I’m posting this so other long-time users can make informed decisions and to see whether others are experiencing the same thing.

Some days I felt motivated, other days I felt exhausted and defeated when nothing seemed to change. Starting over again and again really wears you down.

Food has been the hardest part. I feel guilty when I eat, but food is also the only thing that brings me comfort. I’ll enjoy a meal and then immediately feel bad about it replaying it in my head, thinking about calories, thinking about how I should make up for it later. Wanting to be healthier while still finding happiness in food feels like a constant internal battle.

I don’t just want to look better. I want clearer skin, more energy, and to feel comfortable in my own body. But seeing glow-ups and transformations online makes it feel like everyone else figured it out except me. Some days I honestly don’t know where to start anymore.

Lately, I’ve been focusing more on understanding why I struggle my habits, mindset, and relationship with food instead of punishing myself. It’s been eye-opening, but also emotional.

If you’ve ever felt stuck in this cycle trying, stopping, restarting, feeling guilty I’d really love to hear your story. What did you struggle with the most? What helped, even a little?",1767362715.0,7,19,nutrition,diet

I’m male, 5’9” and currently around 112 pounds. I’m way underweight and it really bothers me how skinny I look and feel. I want to gain weight badly (and hopefully some muscle), but my biggest roadblock is I have almost no appetite at all.

One decent meal a day feels like plenty – I rarely get actually hungry, and food just doesn’t sound good most of the time. Even when I try calorie-dense stuff, it’s hard to force it down consistently.

I used to smoke (quit a while ago) and still vape occasionally, but I’m planning to quit that soon too.

I’ve heard quitting nicotine can help appetite long-term, but right now I need ways to make eating easier. Things like:

•  Homemade shakes or liquid calories?

•  Ways to build hunger (exercise, timing, etc.)?

•  Any safe supplements people have used for appetite?

Anyone else start from super underweight with little/no hunger? How did you get consistent calories in and start gaining?

Appreciate any advice – I really want to change this.

Yet at the same time, clearly we aren’t all dying of heart attacks in our 50s either. So what’s the deal?

I don’t mean “why can some people eat like crap and not gan weight” because thats mostly the result of differences in metabolism and unseen lifestyle differences — but what about the *other* stuff we associate with poor dieting? Is there that much genetic variation in how well a body can withstand copious sodium? 

Im very much a believer that there’s no shame in the fact some people face more health problems than others in old age and others don’t, nobody lives forever and its reasonable for people not to expect to reman vibrant and healthy up until they die one night in their sleep at 104 — but I am curious what the actual science and anatomical reasons are that so many people are able to live relatively long and comfortable lives despite on paper having abysmally unhealthy lifestyles?

1pt2qgn,Advice on getting rid of disgust for certain foods and vegetables,"Since childhood, my parents mostly fed me  meat and other protein-heavy foods mostly because I was a very picky eater then. Instead of forcing me to eat different foods, they didn’t really bother much. Over time, this led to me developing a strong disgust toward vegetables and many other foods.

Even though I know vegetables and a balanced diet are important for my health, I genuinely struggle with trying them. It’s not just preference I feel anxious about it. Sometimes the smell puts me off immediately, other times it’s the texture or even just the way the food looks. My body reacts with resistance before I even taste it. 

I really want to change this. I want to be able to eat vegetables and eggs, which I currently have a strong dislike for, and move toward a proper, balanced diet instead of relying mostly on protein. I’m tired of feeling limited by my eating habits and want to improve my health and relationship with food.

If anyone has gone through something similar, or has advice on how to slowly overcome food aversion, fear of trying new foods, or tips for easing into vegetables and eggs, I’d really appreciate it. Any suggestions, strategies, or personal experiences would mean a lot.

1pt1m85,Oats Overnight Overnight Oats Dupe,"Hey there - I've been eating Oats Overnight brand overnight oats for a while because I stocked up at Costco, but they're quite expensive for what they are, and I have all the ingredients at home anyway. I searched all over for a duplicate recipe that would allow me to make them in bulk but wasn't able to find anything beyond 100 recipe blogs telling me all the different flavors I can make for overnight oats.

I found that I could make a pretty close match a single serving of the shake version with the following:

>1 cup your choice of milk

>1/3 cup of rolled oats

>1 tbsp Chia seeds

>1 Scoop protein powder (I used MyProtein Strawberry Milkshake Whey - you can do a full scoop but it makes the mix a bit too powdery so I go almost all the way)

To get the bulk recipe, I had to tweak it a bit - adding a little more oats and chia seeds. To make a week's worth at once (7 servings) here's what I do: 

>70g Chia Seeds

>297g Rolled Oats

>7 Scoops of protein powder (too messy to pour anyway)

>Then I use a 1/2 cup measuring cup for a serving, which is around 60g. 

This will make overnight oats that are drinkable. If you want to do the scoopable one, you'd just reduce down the milk a few ounces. Per the app I use, you get 441 calories / 11g fat / 42g carbs / 45.3g protein including the milk, although you can easily get this lower with a different milk, if that's what you're into.

Can i ask for some advice please?

It’s about my 18 yr old son. 
He’s very fit and active, does lots of sports. He’s very social and has a good group of friends he sees daily.
He was a late developer, and very late into puberty. Has only recently caught up in height with his friends. For years he’s wanted to be very fit and muscular but is still very skinny. I’ve told him he will bulk out eventually. 

But he doesn’t want to wait, wo has started goimg to thhe local gym and working out frequently. All good and normal.

My concern is that he has started making enormous quantities of protein shakes . He drinks about 1.3l every day, oftend downing the whole thing in one or two gulps, over the space of a few minutes.

To me this feels like a bad choice. Too much, too quickly, too impatient.

His shake is made of ’gainer’, bananas, oats and a local yogurt drink all blended together.

Is this a reasonable amount to consume? 
Will it do him any harm?
Should i gently steer him in a different direction? (He’s a teenager so likely won’t appreciate any input from me)

When it is colder, an increased amount of energy will be allocated towards maintaining the body's temperature. A higher number of calories will not always be expended, but the way in which the body regulates its appetite will be affected through hormonal signaling. The effects of cold exposure on hunger-regulating hormones such as leptin and ghrelin are well-established, as well as the increased preference for higher-energy foods.  
  
It is also interesting to note that there is an appetite change due to cold exposure even when there is no activity change, meaning the effect of cold exposure on appetite is not purely behavioral i.e., seasonally-based.

I just wanted to ask this question. I had a big sugar craving today and gulped down an entire thing of biscuits. According to the nutrition facts on the packaging, I did some math and found out I ate approximately 112 grams of sugar.

I should mention that I don't eat nearly this much on most days. When I do eat sugary items, it 's usually fruits and in normal amounts. I also take 2 hour walks everyday due to work. I operate on a 2,000 calorie diet and I am trying to lose weight by CICO. 

Will this one day of eating a lot of sugar cause me issues down the line? What should I do today to counteract the negative effects of eating this much sugar?

Would appreciate any clarifications. Happy Holidays!",1765909150.0,0,24,nutrition,diet

1pnn2s0,Does Protein Used for Repairing Muscle Count Towards Calories?,"1.  It is my understanding that a unit of protein cannot simultaneously be used for repairing muscle and be broken down into energy. For instance, if the body needed 1 g of protein to build muscle, once the person ate 1 g of protein, it would only be used for repairing muscle and could NOT be used for energy. Does this sound correct?

  
2. If statement #1 is correct, wouldn't it make sense not to count calories from protein if they are used to build muscle? For instance, if my body needed 100 g of protein just to repair muscle, and I ate 100 g of protein, that amount of calories (about 400 kcals) shouldn't count towards my daily caloric intake because it was not broken down for energy.

1pn4civ,Ezekiel Bread or Einkorn based breads? Which is better for me (I want to lower cholesterol),"26M here, trying to make a smarter long term diet choice and could use some perspective. I have been paying more attention to ingredients and how foods actually affect health rather than just following generic “carbs are bad” advice.

I am currently stuck between einkorn bread, usually whole grain sourdough, and Ezekiel bread. From what I understand, einkorn is an ancient wheat with a different gluten structure and fermentation benefits, while Ezekiel is made from sprouted grains and legumes with no refined flour. Both seem a lot better than standard white or enriched bread, but they are often recommended for different reasons.

One of my main goals is lowering cholesterol and supporting heart health, along with weight management and general health. I am active but not an athlete, and I am not trying to go low carb, just choosing better versions of foods I already eat. Digestion and how filling the bread actually is also matter to me, not just the nutrition label.

I’m trying to get back in shape and regain control of my life. I’ve posted before, but to summarise, after losing my job and going through some personal issues, I turned to food.

Long story short, I gained about 20 kg (44 lb) in less than a year (11 months and 2 weeks). I stopped working out completely, I used to train daily and was very active (cycling, running marathons, etc) and replaced that with overeating, LIKE TOO MUCH.

Starting this Monday, I want to reset, improve my diet and get back to exercising.

Current stats & plan: Weight: 108 kg / 238 lb - Height: 185 cm / 6'1"" - Planing: between 10-20k steps per day - Gym: starting week 2, not the first week.

I have a few questions and would really appreciate your advice:

1. Is eating 250 g/ (≈8.8 oz) of chicken breast in one meal too much?
2. Is 250 g/ (≈8.8 oz) of salmon too much?
3. I’m planning to start with low calories (\~1500 kcal), then gradually increase to around 1900 kcal. How do I accurately calculate how many calories I should eat once I start lifting weights?
4. My goal is to reach 92–85 kg (202–187 lb) within 3 months. Is that realistic, or is it too aggressive?
5. All these YouTube videos claiming “lost 30 kg / 66 lb in 3 months” are they legit or mostly BS?
6. I’ve never used protein shakes before. Should I stick to whole foods only, or learn to incorporate protein shakes (pre/post workout)?
7. Once I start training, is 30 minutes of treadmill after working out + 20k steps per day too much, or manageable?

Lunch... a ham and cheese lettuce wrap with mustard, 20 or so almonds and left-over salad w/balsamic from dinner the night before, another toasted slice of Dave's Killer and 8-12oz of water.

This is generally the early menu as I do not get bored eating the same thing each day. I actually prefer consistency here. Dinner is where I get my change-ups. Almost never have red meat. Six ounces of pork, chicken or fish, some kind of sauce, brown rice or beans, veggies, water. I am pretty good at the 1/2-1/4-1/4 portion and use a 10-inch plate.

Sorry for the book, but figured I'd get the facts out there for you to maybe reduce the questions. What should I have daily for those first two meals that is 30 to 40 carbs each and nutrient dense? Thanks for your thoughts.

I showed my diet plan to chatGPT, and as a vegetarian it highlighted the following nutrients that I should be paying attention to:

\- Vitamin D (not existent in diet, and I rarely go out to the sun)

\- Vitamin B12 (only source of this are eggs that I eat every other day)

\- Omega 3 (I consume chia and flax seeds, but they are not a substitue for EPA/DLA found on fish oil)

\- And a bunch of other things that could be lacking, but hopefully nothing alarming; Iodine, Calcium, and Zinc.

I'm considering taking supplements for these nutrients; however, I'm not sure if it's the right path. Please address the following questions that I have:

**Do you think taking multi-vitamin supplements that contains both Vit-D and Vit-b12, along with omega 3 capsules, the right choice for me?** Is there a possiblity of over-consuming these nuntrients?

1pi0znj,How accurate are specific Atwater factors for very fibrous foods?,"Let’s take canned kidney beans for example. According to [the Danish food database (Frida)](https://frida.fooddata.dk/food/1810?lang=en), they contain per 100 g:

- 6.1 g protein
- 0.9 g fat
- 19.7 g carbohydrates by difference, of which 11.6 g are available and 8.0 g are dietary fiber

The database counts the calories per European Union legislation, i.e. 4 kcal/g available carbohydrate and protein, 2 kcal/g fiber, 9 kcal/g fat, so the total energy content comes out to 94.9 kcal per 100 g.

On the other hand US food databases like the [USDA’s FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/) or the [University of Minnesota’s Nutrition Coordinating Center](https://www.ncc.umn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Appendix-11-Nutrient-Information.pdf) use specific Atwater factors to count calories. For legumes like the aforementioned kidney beans, those are: 4.07 kcal/g carbohydrates by difference (i.e. available + fiber), 3.47 kcal/g protein, 8.37 kcal/g fat. So these beans come out to 108.9 g per 100 g.

Now obviously a difference of 14 kcal per 100 g isn’t massive but not completely negligible for low calorie foods like legumes. So that makes me wonder why modern US food databases use the specific Atwater factors for fibrous foods considering that this system doesn’t seem to take fiber into consideration?

All of this being said, i’m broke, hungry and slowly losing weight. I have hardly no time to cook.. i’m usually shopping at the dollar store and lugging around instant oats, rice, microwave food, canned veggies and canned meat and eating wherever I can find a microwave... 

Any advice on other filling easy options that will at least keep me mostly healthy? lol

I'm following a vegan diet, and I'm currently taking a 1200mcg cyanocobalamin B12 once a week, and and a  150epa/300dha omega 3 tablet every day.


I do my best to eat healthy and almost every meal I eat is with whole foods. But I admit I don't have the patience to check how much and which vitamins are in each veggie I eat, and I tend to eat one meal for an entire week at a time. That's why I'm wondering if I should just switch to a multivitamin to make sure I cover all my bases.

 But would 200mcg of methylcobalamin B12 a day be enough- I heard it's not as easily absorbed as cyanocobalamin? Or should I keep taking my B12 tablet maybe once a month instead of weekly along with this multivitamin?

This multivitamin seems to be ""all natural"", does that mean it may be less effective?

1pf2rrf,r/nutrition subreddit changes Dec 2025,"You can find the current sub rules at https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/about/rules/

## Mod team and rule changes

* **Moderator changes** - a few months back this subreddit had some key moderators retire and will lose another at the start of the year due to new requirements from the site

This sub has long had fewer mods than needed and these developments are compounding the issue, therefore please note the following...


* **The Personal Nutrition rule will be paused** - This is one of the biggest mod time sinks for this subreddit. The rule came about because the community got tired of the front page being overwhelmingly ""help me with my nutrition"" posts because they 1) tend to be too specific to apply to others 2) the submitter close to never offers all the info necessary to address the concern and 3) they rarely receive accurate advice. Without enough moderators to help due to the reduced team size, this rule will not be enforced for the time being. Therefore, as a consequence, be aware that the sub front page is going to massively increase into a bad advice feed and will be an even less science post based forum

* **Rage bait posts no longer allowed** - Going forward these kinds of argument inducing attempts will be removed. These kinds of posts are about all the manpower we have for posts at this time.

## Help wanted

If you want the sub to be different, it takes more help in the kitchen. We need two types of moderators

* RD moderators - to help with research, survey, and misinformation concerns. 

* General moderators - to help with more routine / standard moderation concerns

Your account must be more than 9 months old and a history that shows level headed interaction. Mod experience on Reddit is great, but not required. Ditto for having a little coding experience. Let us know whether you mod any other subs and if you have any relevant experience like moderating other forums/pages, using back-end web tools, etc. To begin the application process, please [**message the moderators**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/nutrition)

I hope that makes sense, but for example, a lot of people at the same BMI (particularly a low one but also high, from anecdotal experience) may have very different consequences e.g Person A is experiencing hair loss and amenorrhea, whereas Person B doesn’t have any of these concerns.

These are very non-scientific observations ofc, but does this mean there’s a natural healthy weight that’s individualised or is it more of the adapting curve ig to a changing weight ?

I had a post taken down in the Trader Joe's sub, weirdly, after asking this question. So here I am asking in a sub that I suspect has more nutritionally informed peeps.

I asked if TJs SF Style Sourdough was made with real sourdough. I ask because I understand that a lot of products these days that are marked ""sourdough"" are only flavored, but made like normal bread - not sourdough. I think that's a legit question, but would love to learn more about whether a lot of ""sourdough"" products are not actually sourdough. My understanding is that sourdough is nutritionally better/different to normal bread.

Bizarrely before deletion I saw one reply: ""It's real sourdough and no there's not a significant nutritional difference."" Which seems odd at best!

- How about a salty, thicker soup?

- What happens when I dry-brine chicken, where I salt the raw meat and keep it in the fridge over night so that the salt goes into the meat via osmosis?

No other species gets tooth decay from their species-appropriate diet, so our species-appropriate diet should logically contain foods that do not decay out teeth.

I know someone is going to say ""you don't need teeth to reproduce."" This is true but most humans even back tens of thousands of years ago were not reproducing until their teens. Pretty hard to survive 13+ years if your teeth are rotting, which leads to the loss of the teeth, which leads to the inability to survive due to the inability to eat.

They often cites the study by Leung et al. (2008) (https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1096/fj.08-121962) about the prevalence of BCMO1 mutation in british women.

The problem is: we already have a unit of measurement of beta-carotene to ""vitamin A"" coversion, it's the mcgRAE (micrograms of retinol activity equivalent), and unless it's expressed, is the standard unit of measure of ""vitamin A"" that already takes into account the genetic variation of carotene coversion. You can ready more about it on the process of setting the dietary recommended allowance for vitamin A, available on the DRI: Guide to essential nutrients (2006).

It's true that genetics and micronutrient status is important for the proper functioning of BCMO1, but that doesn't means that carotenoids aren't important sources of ""vitamin A"".

However these new nutritional facts state that a serving which is now listed as 3oz contains

0.6 grams of fat
 0 grams of carbs

The thing is that most recent studies seem to have a big methodology error witch is not counting on negative nitrogen balance on the first 14 days of the study in witch the body needs time to adapt to a new amount of protein consumption.

RAM is your computer’s short-term, easy access, working memory that holds data/instructions for programs currently in use. Hard disk is denser, slower, more permanent long-term memory wherein data must be read from/written to the physical disk.

So in terms of access speed (carbs are a faster, more accessible energy source than fats, which requires some extra steps for the body to convert it to useable energy), storage capacity (the body can store more energy as fat than it can as glycogen), and flexibility (the body prefers carbs as its energy source but can adapt to using fats for fuel when necessary), would this be a reasonable comparison?",1760984576.0,7,3,nutrition,diet

\- Tries to get as much protein (and other nutritional components) as possible from whole foods.

\- Also wants to cut down meat consumption, and favours Textured Vegetable Protein (from soya) as a cheap and accessible protein source.

  
So, the extrusion process used to make TVP apparently decreases the amount of bioavailable lysine. 

  
... **Could one literally just pop a lysine supplement during the same day (or even alongside the meal) to overcome this?**

  
Herein lies the thing that still confuses me with nutrition. I do realise that the amino acids from the TVP are in a form that will break down more slowly while the lysine tablet is essentially just a powder that will break down rapidly, but... you are essentially mixing them all together in your small intestine, no?

  
So even if 99% of your diet is whole foods, including complete proteins, but you just want a little boost to this one incomplete protein, would this be an effective approach? Or is that bit of lysine likely to just be unused by the body because - by itself - it lacks the necessary cofactors, even if you're chugging it down with something like TVP that supposedly contains all the other amino acids?",1760474886.0,2,12,nutrition,diet

I went to the fridge, pulled out a box of chicken wings that I cooked sous vide earlier (8 hours at 68C, then 15 minutes in the oven to crisp the skin), weighted each one individually and got an average of 50 grams per wing. Then I pulled out the bones, weighed them, and got an average of 9 grams of bone per wing - i.e. slightly under 20%, *after* accounting for all the moisture lost in cooking. 

Then I started googling, and got really surprised by the results - every single result gives me 45% or more bone content in a wing, often specifying that this is for *raw* chicken, i.e. before moisture loss in cooking, so it should be even higher in cooked chicken.

What could explain this wild discrepancy in the results? Is something wrong with my measurement method?

soy milk is made from whole soybeans (high in oxalates) but processing removes some of it. studies show commercial soy milks have around 10-30mg oxalates per cup. at the same time, they're fortified with calcium (tricalcium phosphate). for example, silk soy milk has 300mg calcium per cup.

so if you drink 3 cups a day (with meals), thats about 60-90mg of oxalates and 900mg of calcium. since calcium binds oxalates in the gut and prevents them from being absorbed (and ending up in the kidneys), it seems like the calcium should more than offset the oxalate content.

1mu6f4l,How do the calories from protein work?,"Hi everyone, this may be an extremely stupid question but I can’t find the answer I’m looking for so I wanted to ask here in hopes one of you could clear up some of my misconceptions.

Edit: TLDR: If you eat 800 calories of protein and 50% (random percent) are used for energy and 50% are used for building, then won’t you your body need an additional 400 calories to maintain its TDEE? (Because the building calories aren’t currently being used for energy but are stored)

Here’s the scenario: You have a maintenance of 2000 calories, you ingest 800 calories of protein bringing your daily net total to -1200 instead of -2000. The amino acids in the protein will be used for various things that aren’t providing energy for the body. Just for the sake of the exercise let’s say 50% energy 50% building. That would mean 400 calories are stored as your body builds itself up, and aren’t being currently used as energy.

Now here is my question: Am I right in thinking that your body needs to now find an “additional” 400 calories to fuel itself? I agree calories in calories out in terms of total weight, but if you were trying to keep muscle mass but cut fat (if my way of thinking is even true) wouldn’t it be important to look at things in terms of what calories are being used to build and what calories are being used for energy instead of just total energy from all sources?

But honestly it doesn't make much sense, Lets use a test subject for an example. If they Roast a potato, uses spray and cook & not added oil, Shouldn't that keep the natural state more normal and lower the G.I vs Boiling? Its been rumored that boiling leads to a decrease in minerals. So theoretically, Dry Heat shouldn't mean an increase?

1msvbog,Adding raw cracked rye to overnight oats,"I've read that rye can significantly help reduce phytic acid in overnight oats.

""When preparing these grains according to traditional methods, such as those provided in Nourishing Traditions, the best idea is to add one or more tablespoons of freshly ground rye flour. Rye flour contains high levels of phytase that will be activated during the soaking process. ... Even without the rye flour, overnight soaking of oats and other low-phytase grains greatly improves digestibility but won’t eliminate too much phytic acid. ... You can keep whole rye grains and grind a small amount in a mini grinder for adding to these grains during the soaking process.""

1q328h9,Pantry Garlic-Butter Ramen (Comfort Food Using What We Had),"It’s been a tight month, so we’ve been in a use-what-we-have phase. This garlic-butter ramen turned into a big comfort win and fed myself and my son( plus my kid asked for seconds). So I made it twice. Posting in case it helps someone else stretch pantry staples.

Garlic-Butter Savory Ramen (No Packet)

Serves: 2

Cost: very low / pantry-based

Ingredients

•	2 packs ramen noodles (no seasoning packets… if anyone has ideas on how to use these, I would love them)

•	3 cups water

•	1–1½ teaspoons Better Than Bouillon (I used chicken)

•	1–2 tablespoons butter

•	2 cloves garlic, minced (but garlic powder would work too)

•	Black pepper, just a bit whatever amount you like

Optional add-ins (used what we had):

•	Frozen mixed vegetables or peas/corn

Instructions

1. Bring 3 cups water to a gentle boil in a saucepan.
2. Add ramen noodles (do not break them unless you prefer shorter noodles). Cook 2–3 minutes until tender.
3. Drain noodles over a bowl to catch the noodle water.
4. Lower heat. Add butter and garlic directly to the pot. (If using frozen veggies, ( I added a couple of table spoons) put those in before the garlic. Stir and let it simmer in the pot for about a min until you smell the garlic.
5. Add about 1/4 cup of the noodle water back into the pot. More if you like it soupy.
6. Add noodles back to the mixture and stir until shiny.
7. Serve with a little broth left in the bowl (more like savory pasta than soup).

Notes:

This came out way better than packet ramen. richer, comforting, and customizable. Next time I’d try adding leftover chicken or a soft-boiled egg if available. You can even add a touch of milk if you want it creamy or sriracha or chili powder if you want it just a touch spicy.",1767465316.0,203,41,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet

1pztb06,Recipes and/or ways to hide fruits/vegetables?,"I’ve never liked vegetables. Part of it is because I stopped eating them WAY back when I was a little kid, so I’m used to terribly unhealthy stuff (salty fried foods, mostly. I have to heavily season everything just to stomach it). I also have a mindset of “if I don’t like how it looks/smells, it’s nasty”, and I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember. All vegetables taste horribly bitter to me- like eating bland, crusty cardboard. Fruits taste disgustingly sour- no matter how you mask them or if they’re ripe or not. I also have bad texture issues, so if something is mushy or too chewy/tough (like cauliflower for example), it genuinely makes me gag and choke.

Despite this, I want to eat healthier. I’m sick of wasting money eating fast food for dinner almost everyday and chicken is beginning to get boring for me. If anyone could suggest any good ways of hiding vegetables or fruit in what I eat? I’m INCREDIBLY picky, and I can usually taste hidden vegetables so I need some good ones.

Edit: I’ve got a lot of suggestions for things I can’t really stomach so I’ll add that I cannot eat bananas. I’ve hated them since I was a baby and I can’t even stand touching them, smelling them, all of the above. I don’t really like pasta unless it’s Alfredo, and I also have to mention that I am 18 and still live with my parents, so I usually just eat whatever my mom makes (which, on our low budget, is usually chicken, mash potatoes, and corn).

I don't own any, and I hate heat. I have zero tolerance for it (I find medium salsa to be at the very top of my tolerance).

Is there a flavour I'm going to be missing, will the recipe work without them, or is there something I should substitute in? I do have most common spices and herbs (including chili powder), for reference.

The recipe is for chicken wings, but I'm sure it's fine for drumsticks. I just dunno what to do about the chili flakes.

* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 1 cup honey
* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup ketchup
* 1/4 cup chopped onions
* 2 tablespoons oil
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
* Toasted sesame seeds (optional)

1. Rinse chicken and pat dry. Cut off and discard wing tips. Cut each wing at joint to make two sections. Sprinkle wing parts with salt & pepper. Place wings on broiler pan. Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat for 20 minutes, 10 minutes a side or until chicken is brown. Place chicken into slow cooker.
2. For sauce, combine honey, sou sauce, ketchup, onions, oil, garlic, and pepper flakes in bowl. Pour over chicken wings. Cover; cook on low 4 to 5 hours or on high 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Garnish with sesame seeds, if desired.

1po8ejb,What are your 5 go-to meals?,"Hey, so I have some knowledge on cooking, but I have just recently attempted to get back into cooking and planning my shopping trips more efficiently, but its difficult. 
I was in a relationship with a man who used to cook for me the majority of the time, and I recently left him. I've been staying with my best friend, and we have been eating out and staying in cooking some of the time. 
Even though we have cheat meals we plan together, we both are trying to go to the gym and eat healthier as well.
So my question is if you had to name 5 go to meals, what would they be? They can be ""throw-together"" meals, they can be something that takes a day to cook, it doesn't matter. But I want to get ideas of how I can create a better routine between eating healthier at home and staying busy between work and other lifestyle hobbies.

1pnv9rm,Tuna and Lemon Pasta,"This is the easiest and cheapest meal around and my kids loved it when they were young and cook it themselves now. You need a can of Sirena Tuna in oil, just judge by how many you’re cooking for as to how much to use, I like a fair amount of tuna so I’ll use a 185g can if I’m cooking for myself (but you could use less).

Ingredients:

Sirena Italian Style of Tuna in oil (undrained or lightly drained as you need the oil for sauce)

Lemons (at least 2) for juice and zest

Bunch of spring onions or chives

Pasta of choice.

Method, cook pasta, while pasta is cooking, empty tuna into a bowl and break up a bit with a fork. Juice the lemons and add to the tuna. Aquaplane a good heaped teaspoon or so of zest over the top. Chop spring onions or chives finely and add to tuna and gently stir it all together. Do not cook the sauce. Drain the pasta and retain about half a cup of pasta water and add to tuna mixture. Dish the pasta up and top with tuna mixture. My sons like to add a bit of cheese but I don’t think I need it. It’s delicious and so simple.",1765867475.0,118,19,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet

1pnexj7,Some Lovely Soul Cracked the Tofu Code!,"After MUCH trial and error, I’ve finally found a tofu recipe that my omnivore teen son not only *tolerated,* but **liked!**

I used this recipe: https://www.plantpowercouple.com/recipes/vegan-cutlets-recipe/

- 1 (16-oz) block extra firm tofu
For the marinade:
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 1 Tbsp dry white wine
- 2 cloves garlic minced
- 2 Tbsp vegan chicken-style bouillon powder
For the breading:
- 2/3 cup Italian bread crumbs*
- 2 Tbsp vegan cheese seasoning or vegan parmesan

INSTRUCTIONS
 
Prep the tofu: Place the package of tofu in the freezer overnight or until frozen through. In the morning, take it out of the freezer and place it in the fridge or on the counter to thaw. When the tofu is thawed (about 8 hours), squeeze the tofu gently over the sink to expel excess liquid and press it as you normally would. It should be pretty sturdy and spongey, but still handle with care, so you don't break the tofu.

Marinate the tofu: Next, turn the tofu block on its side and slice it longways into 3 (½-inch thick) large rectangles. Mix all the ingredients for your marinade in a small bowl with a whisk. Pour the marinade over the tofu slices and cover. Treat tofu with care so it doesn’t break apart and use a large or several large shallow dishes to make sure each tofu cutlet is completely coated. You can also pour the marinade in layers. That’s what I normally do! Let marinate for at least 30 minutes or overnight.

Bread the tofu: When you're ready to make the cutlets, turn your oven to 350F and grab a large baking sheet. Get out a large casserole dish. (Ideally, one that fits all the cutlets at once.) If you’re using a smaller dish, you’ll have to do this in batches. Add the bread crumbs and cheesy garlic blend and mix with a whisk. Lift tofu pieces out of the marinade one by one and lay onto bread crumbs, pressing down gently. Brush the exposed side with excess marinade. Then, turn the tofu over in the bread crumbs and press to stick the crumbs to the other side.

Bake the tofu: Place your cutlets on the baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes, flip each one carefully, and bake another 30 minutes. Then, turn the oven off and let the cutlets sit in the oven for another 10 minutes in the oven.
Serve: Serve these cutlets with a good squeeze of lemon juice on top of a mountain of pasta or a fresh salad. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for 5-7 days or the freezer for up to 3 months.
 
►
NOTES
*Make sure you check the ingredients on the brand of bread crumbs you're using, as many contain dairy or egg. We used our homemade Italian bread crumbs.

Wine sub: You can substitute white wine vinegar, rice vinegar, white vinegar for the white wine if you wish.


I didn’t have a powdered fake chicken bouillon, but we keep cubes of Not-Chickn (we get them at Kroger), so I used one of those. I didn’t want to open a bottle of wine and I had some navel oranges that weren’t super sweet, so I cut into one of those and just used the juice in place of the wine. I added about a tablespoon of water to help with the bouillon cube (and an extra clove of garlic because Garlic is Life) and blitzed it all in the blender until smooth. The EVOO emulsified and was very easy to pour onto the tofu. I let it marinate in the fridge for a couple hours, and then dredged it in panko breadcrumbs with a little Parmesan mixed in.

I was expecting the cutlets to be soggy from cooking directly on a baking sheet, but they were crispy and great, and even held up as leftovers the next day. This is DEFINITELY a keeper recipe for our household. I used the tofu cutlets in place of schnitzel for a German-themed dinner, but I can easily see repurposing this for all sorts of different meals.

Sorry for no pictures—I ate the last one before I even thought about it, lol.

1plvo6l,Ideas on what to add to my simple grocery list?,"Hey guys! So I prefer to mostly eat food that doesn't require cooking. I have a flexible whole foods focus, and I don't generally consume much sugar or sweets. I also do some simple cooking in my rice cooker, which also has a steamer basket. I prefer to keep ingredients simple. I want to share some of my go-to meals I've been enjoying and if anyone has suggestions for ingredients to add, or similar things I could eat, let me know! Also I'm not getting a lot of vegetables in my diet currently so if anyone has suggestions for how to add more veggies let me know. I don't eat a lot of fruit due to the sugar (I have t2 diabetes) but love berries and they tend to be a good fruit for diabetes.

Cottage cheese-based meals: 
Whole fat cottage cheese with various ingredients added. Some of the things I add are: sliced almonds, unsalted peanuts, pepitas, grape tomatoes. Sometimes I will put it on a small bed of spring mix or fresh spinach.

Yogurt based meals: 
Plain nonfat yogurt with a little half and half added to increase fat/satiety (whole fat plain yogurt is twice the price of nonfat where I buy groceries), and I add various types of healthier granola I can find, cacao nibs, unsweetened shredded coconut, peanuts, blackberries, raspberries. Some allulose to sweeten.

Grain meals in rice cooker: 
Brown rice and quinoa with seasonings and some veggies (usually peas and carrots.) I add salmon, scallops or chicken, and sometimes tofu. 

Partner says he can cook in rice cooker but I'm not sure how: brown rice noodles with above mentioned rice cooker meal ingredients. I also have on my shopping list to add to rice cooker meals: mushrooms. 

I don't really cook because numerous health problems make it difficult, I don't really know how, and I also spend up to 15 hours a day at work or commuting to work so I don't have much time either.

INGREDIENTS:

•  1 store-bought pie crust (or homemade if preferred)

•  1/3 cup butter

•  1/3 cup onion, diced

•  1/3 cup all-purpose flour

•  1 3/4 cups chicken broth

•  1/2 cup milk

•  2 1/2 cups frozen mixed vegetables (or veggie mix of choice)

•  2 1/2 cups cooked chicken, diced or shredded

•  Salt and pepper to taste (start with about 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper)

•  Optional: a splash of white wine or a pinch of thyme for extra flavor

DIRECTIONS:

1.  Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).

2.  Place the bottom pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish. Set aside.

3.  In a medium-large pot or deep skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat.

4.  Add the diced onion and cook until soft and translucent (about 3–4 minutes).

5.  Sprinkle the flour over the butter/onion mixture. Stir constantly and cook for 2 minutes to make a roux (it will look like a thick paste).

6.  Slowly whisk in the chicken broth and milk. Keep stirring until the mixture is smooth and starts to thicken.

7.  Add the frozen mixed vegetables and cooked chicken. Stir well.

8.  Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let the filling simmer for a few minutes until it’s thick and creamy. (If it gets too thick, you can add a little more broth or milk.)

9.  Taste and adjust seasoning (this is also when you can add a splash of wine or herbs if desired).

10.  Pour the hot chicken filling into the prepared pie crust.

11.  Cover with the second crust (or cut vents if using a full top crust). Seal and crimp the edges. Cut a few slits in the top to let steam escape.

12.  Optional: Brush the top crust with a little milk or beaten egg for a golden finish.

13.  Place the pie on a baking sheet (to catch any spills) and bake at 425°F for 30–40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.

14.  Let cool for 10–15 minutes before slicing (this helps the filling set).

Enjoy your homemade chicken pot pie!

1p35f46,2 Meals a Day - How to do it right?,"Hey! I’m looking for some advice on a healthy diet built around **two meals a day.** I want to cut a bit first, then maintain. I really like the 2‑meals‑a‑day setup because I spend less time eating and I get fewer energy crashes after meals.

**I’m not totally sure how to do it in a healthy way, though.**

Right now I’m doing lunch + dinner with roughly equal calories (about 2,200 kcal per day, sometimes a banana, kefir, etc. on top). The issue is, most recipes I find for a \~1,000 kcal meal rely on lots of cheese or fatty beef. I’m not sure if that much fat is good for cutting (I know calories are what matter, but can too much fat make me look “puffy”?). On the flip side, when I look at “normal” meals like chicken, to hit \~1,000 kcal I’d need a huge portion.

I’m starting to wonder if I’m approaching this right. Any tips would be super appreciated. Thanks!",1763747650.0,44,14,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet

At that point I'm trying to eat 1500-2000kcal (a pasta meal with fish and/or cheese), for a total of 3500 a day. I want to sleep at around midnight.

But my reflux has increased a lot, causing coughing that interfers with my sleep, as well as some day time coughing. This makes me fatigued, which is a problem in general (plus the reason I'm trying to eat a lot is to put about 8kg on and be heavier for mma, which I do 8-13 hours a week. But the fatigue has a negative effect on training and mood).

How do people practically fit in calories earlier so they can leave the final few hours of the day food-free or nearly food-free? You can't eat such a big meal at lunch if working, compared to a dinner. Do you cook a big dinner at night, put it in a big container and then eat it as breakfast? I also have adhd and find the time aspect difficult.

Can't meal prep days in advance, as I'm in shared accommodation.

We moved to Oahu a few months ago and are trying to figure out a meal plan that works for us that stays within or under our budget. My boyfriend and I are both super into fitness and train like bodybuilders so we eat a lot of food when we bulk (like now). 

We have been able to spend under 1k a month on food so far (~$900/mo), however it’s a lot of processed unhealthy foods (or just things high in sugar and sodium) because it’s all we can get our toddler to eat, and money is tight so we want to try to save as much as we can.

On top of that I have GERD so we stay away from anything with tomato sauce/paste/whole/etc. and high fat and meals with a lot of spices.
Does anyone have any ideas or shopping recommendations for us? If it helps we’re in ewa beach, have base access and already go to Costco for things like meat eggs milk etc.

1otlp6y,I started making “soup cubes” from scraps I used to throw away… and now everything I cook tastes way better for basically $0,"I cook cheap, like “whatever’s on sale plus whatever’s dying in the fridge. Until recently I threw away every vegetable scrap and dumped my pasta/bean water straight down the drain.

One day I saw someone mention freezing stock in muffin tins and gave it a go. I grabbed a big freezer bag, tossed in every veggie scrap for a week (onion ends, celery leaves, carrot peels, mushroom stems, herb stems… nothing fancy), and I also saved the starchy water from boiling pasta and beans.

When the bag got full, I dumped everything in a pot, covered with water, added a tiny bit of salt, a peppercorn or two, and simmered it for like an hour. Strained it, poured the liquid into a muffin tin, froze it overnight, popped the little “pucks” out, and threw them in a bag.

Now whenever I make meals soups, ramen, rice, frozen veggies, lentils, whatever I just toss in one of these frozen cubes and suddenly it tastes like I put effort into it. Even instant noodles taste deeper instead of salty water.

I probably should have asked how to hide the eggs in a recipe as that was more of what I'm looking for. I've found some good answers though so I'm gonna try them. 

I'm on SNAP and have very limited affordable protein (no beans or legumes) options due to some health issues. Eggs are still something I can afford to eat regularly. The problem is, I don't really like them all that much. I don't hate them, but given the choice to leave them out of a recipe I usually do. I just don't like the texture most of the time. I don't like scrambled eggs and that's mostly how they get added to random recipes. So, what are your hacks for adding more eggs to your diet?

1onhr0j,Need some advice on meal prepping (mainly proteins and maybe breakfast),"So I wanted to try meal prepping a bit because I think it might help me eat healthier but I'm not sure. I live with family so my fridge and freezer space is limited. 

My first idea was maybe meal prepping some proteins. Meat is normally an issue for me mainly because of having to defrost it in advance, so if I can avoid that that would be ideal. So the idea would be I could have a couple versatile proteins that I can easily reheat and add to other stuff or just make some veggies or something on the side and eat it like that. But idk how well that would work and what would be good for that.

The other option would be trying to prep something for breakfast. Cause most days I want something quick for breakfast cause I'm too hungry to cook or anything. But I'm not sure what would be good for this. Cause I'm also only one person so it needs to be easy enough or last long enough that it's worth it and I'll be able to actually eat it before it goes bad. 

Idk, any ideas or advice or anything would be appreciated. I'm having a hard time finding stuff online cause everything seems to be about prepping full meals and that's not really what I wanna do rn.

1omvath,Don't overlook the pumpkins,"It's the time of year when pumpkins get real cheap. Don't overlook them. Usually the smaller types are the ones you want for eating, the jack o lantern ones are good but more inconvenient and seem to have more water. 

They are really easy to cook, just chop in half scoop out, cover with foil and bake for an hour. Then scoop out the meat from the skin and use. It can be done in free time because they keep in the fridge for quite a while. They can also be bagged and frozen. The fresh pumpkin will just sit around the pantry for a long time so they're not too picky and will wait for you. 

Once cooked just pull some out and add to a whole bunch of dishes, adding good bulk and nutrition to so many things. Chop small and add to soups, make actual pumpkin soup, blend and use as a thickener for soups, one of my favorites is to make smoothies with them. The internet is full of pumpkin use ideas. Dont worry if it's not your favorite vegetable, most things you put them into cover the taste or complement it really well.

I took my remaining chicken bone (still had some meat on it) and the bit of rice home and this morning I sautéed up half a diced onion in a pot, then added the chicken leg once the onion was fragrant and slightly browned.

A handful of cans & jars are past their use-by date. Google tells me that it's still safe to eat, although the flavour might be flatter : my grandparents' cellar was cool and dry, and the cans are fine (no dents, no scuffs, no bloating). 

I guess I'm hoping for some reassurance that other people have eaten expired cans for real and not in movies & maybe some recipes: 

* 2 of those small cans of tomato concentrate : 2 years out of date 
* 6 cans of crushed tomatoes : between 20 and 6 months out of date 
* 2 cans of tuna : a year out of date 
* 1 can of corn (in water) : a year out of date 
* 1 jar of artichokes in sunflower oil : 6 months out of date

1odi4on,Need Ideas- Low Effort and GF,"I'm a college athlete looking for meals that are cheap, low effort, and high protein.  I also have celiac and can't eat gluten, so getting enough carbs turns into just eating rice with every meal or paying extraordinary prices for mediocre gluten free bread products.  My campus has a food pantry that I do regularly use, as of posting I recently picked up:

\- pre-packaged tuna, spam, and vienna sausage

\- canned vegetable soup, tomato soup, green beans, and carrots

\- gluten free tortillas and pasta (very limited quantities of both, and the tortillas tend to fall apart immediately so anything that's going to test its abilities to hold together will probably get messy)

\- rice, fried rice mix, and zatarain's dirty rice mix

\- 2 ears of fresh corn on the cob

\- a half dozen eggs

\- two frozen smoothies

\- gluten free pancake mix and cereal

I also have a limited budget to buy groceries beyond what I pick up at the pantry, but wanted to give an idea of what I usually can get my hands on for inspo. The above is a very standard grocery haul from the options they have available.

I placed a second order with them, after a week they sent an email that said sorry your order is taking awhile, we are keeping an eye on it. One more week went by and I responded and asked for an update and what was causing the issue. They said it was packed and ready to go, but the shipper hasn't picked it up, sorry for the delay. They then promptly sent out a few of the items from the order, from a different shipper than the previous order.

I waited another week, so three weeks after the order was placed and asked for another update for the rest of the items and asked for one of the items that expired two weeks ago to be refunded and if the rest would be sent soon. They said the problem was with the shipper, which doesn't really make sense if they could send some of the items unless the warehouse is in a far location from the other or something.

Then they got back to me and refunded all the unsent items. So I kind of feel they were lying about the shipper unless there's something im missing. Which is an annoyance, but whatever. I would probably give them another shot if they gave me a credit towards a future order or something, but they just don't seem reliable. Have others had similar experiences?

I am also a single individual so not having to cook for a family. I am also fine with eating the same stuff over and over again.

\- What are your cheaper end go to fillers for meals? (besides rice and beans)  
  
I am active and have a big appetite so realize I need to start adding some more healthy fillers to meals so I can feel full and satisfied without over eating more of my expensive groceries. I tend to go to protein bars, protein drinks, meats, fresh foods as snacks and the grocery bill adds up quickly towards the end of the month. I need to cut back on the protein bars and drinks as an item to consume every so often verses every day. As that adds up super quickly. I am also going to try to cut back on the healthier snacks at stores. For example, I love heavenly hunks, unreal, and that's it items but man that adds up the bill quickly too. 

\- How do you shop for meat cheaply?

I tend to just grab frozen chicken tenderloins and just throw it in the crock pot with some spices. I can make it go far with many different recipe options. Is there a cheaper way to buy meats or is that a pretty cheap way?

I double up the recipe to make 6 of these. I bought some 8 ounce ramekins but they are too large so I am now getting some 4 ounce ones.

Oat Muffins

(298 calories)

Ingredients

Oats (1/2 cup, 45 g) Grind oats in advance or buy oat flour to avoid having to get out the mixer. 

Unsweetened almond milk or any other milk (1/4 cup, 60 ml)

Baking powder (1/2 tsp, 2.5 g)

1 large egg (or omit if prefer vegan)

1/2 ripened banana or 1/4 cup apple sauce

Blueberries, chopped nuts, cinnamon or whatever else you like to add.

Directions:

STEP 1: Prepare the batter by whisking the batter ingredients together. Can do this in a blender, food processor or by hand with a whisk. (If using bananas,  mashing those up first might be helpful)

STEP 2: Add in any mix-in ingredients & stir them into the batter mixture. Pour into ramekins that have been greased with cooking spray.

STEP 3: Bake in air fryer at 300 F/149 C for 12-15 minutes, OR bake in oven at 350 F / 177 C for 25-30 minutes. All air fryers & ovens are different, so cooking times may vary. (For my air fryer oven, they take 18 minutes at 300°F) For STORAGE: Store in air-tight container in refrigerator for up to 5 days.

This is a trick I've recently discovered and I'm kind of obsessed with it. The consistency is similar to bacon bits, a little crispy, a little chewy. Doesn't feel like you're eating tofu at all. And it is so delicious on salads, soups, baked potatoes, any kind of roasted veggies, pasta, you name it. The seasoning is really flexible! I do a fajita-spiced version for taco night and a soy sauce and lime juice combo specifically for salads. Best part is that it keeps in the fridge really well, so most weeks I make a pound or two ahead of time and add it to whatever dishes I make throughout the week. It packs a LOT of flavor and jazzes up anything I add it to!

I can get tofu on sale at my local store for $2 a lb, even cheaper if I make a trip to the Asian grocery store, which makes this a cheap and delicious way to supplement plant-based protein!

Ingredients:

- 1 lb firm or extra-firm tofu, drained and squeezed

- 2 tbsp oil for cooking, I use olive oil usually

- 1 tbsp soy sauce

- 1 tbsp rice vinegar

- spices as desired: I like to use garlic powder and onion powder

Steps:

1. add oil to a pan

2. crumble tofu as finely as possible into the pan

3. add soy sauce, rice vinegar, and spices, and cook over medium heat for about 30 minutes, stirring and breaking up any chunks. You want to really dry the tofu out and crisp it up. It will brown nicely when it's ready.

1o707n3,Meal Plan: Suggestions or improvements?,"**Location:** Australia

In trying to work with my ADHD, I'd like to create a meal plan for me and my partner that I can just keep repeating, that - for dinners - largely consists of ""dump in the slow cooker"" recipes. 

**Breakfasts:** Porridge (oatmeal), toast & baked beans, fruit (canned in juice), cereal & milk

**Lunches:** Falafel (with some sour cream/sweet chilli), tinned fish & rice/quinoa, leftovers, toasted sandwich

**Dinners:** 

* Variety of packet/jarred curry sauces & chicken breasts - then in the last hour, add tinned fruit (juice drained) and frozen veggies - served with rice
* Savoury mince, served with potato of various forms, or toast - includes frozen veg
* Pasta (usually beef mince & jar sauce) - going to start adding more veg to this, usually it's just peas & carrot
* Mexican chicken (chicken breast, flavour sachet, tomatos), served with beans, salsa, guac & sour cream - can be on rice or over corn chips

I am a parent who has adhd and 3 kids who are neurodivergent and a partner who probably is too. This makes groceries and meal planning stressful because 1. Poor executive function in the grown ups resulting and poor planning and 2. Everyone(mostly the kids) are very picky due to the sensory issues that often come along with being neurodivergent. I am an accommodating parent. I hate when one kid feels left out. So I try my best to make sure they all have something they don’t hate for meals. But this can get expensive and with the rising cost of groceries, it gets harder each week. Add in that we all need to be healthier and I’m just overwhelmed at the thought of just planning a meals and buying groceries. One day, I’ll feel like a grownup… hopefully.

1nzbcv6,A meat-eaters guide/primer to TVP/textured vegetable protein/dry soy chunks,"Soy is likely the only high protein food that is not getting dramatically more expensive in the US, since China is not buying any US soy this fall harvest. Tofu is basically the soy milk version of cheese, and is a bland but adequate protein source, but has limited shelf life and currently isn't that much cheaper than meat.

Textured vegetable protein is made from legumes that have had the oil pressed or extracted from them. In the US this is primarily soy, but it is possible with any legume, and is fairly common with peanuts in China. The defatted leftovers from oil production are heated and forced out of a nozzle at high pressure, which produces a product somewhat like a cheese curl that can absorb liquids easily. While not particularly tasty in its dry form, it absorbs flavors even better than tofu. And its structure is somewhat meat-like. If ground up, it is soy flour, but in little bits, it is like ground meat, and bigger bits can be meat-chunk-like, or fried into a nugget.

While vegan and vegetarian recipes for TVP abound in the internet and in their subreddit, here are some tips from a meat-eaters point of view.

* Remember TVP is sold as a dry product, so its price per pound might seem high, but you are going to add around two times the weight of water or another liquid.
* Being dry, it has a shelf life of many months to a year or more, depending on packaging. Once hydrates, its refrigerated life is similar to meat.
* If you don't over-hydrate it, hydrated TVP can brown with a Maillard reaction just like meat.
* You can flavor it with broth or bullion for a meatier flavor. A little liquid smoke (only a little!) can help as well
* TVP has almost no fat or oil. Adding lard (pig fat), tallow (beef fat), schmaltz (chicken fat), or another animal fat (bacon fat!) will make it much tastier. Another saturated fat like butter, coconut, avocado, or palm oil would be my second choice. A vegetable oil would be my last choice.
* Grocery stores in the US don't often have TVP, but it is readily available online, and health food stores and other specialty food stores often have it

Usage suggestions:

* my most used is as taco ""meat"". Hydrate and add taco seasoning mix or your own recipe, plus some beef flavor, liquid smoke, and a fat. Once put in a taco or burrito, it is hard to tell that is isn't beef
* same with Italian sausage seasoning, especially a spicy one. Not the greatest on it's own, but very good in a lasagna or spaghetti sauce. Use lard and/or olive oil
* use a breakfast sausage seasoning/recipe. These is good browned in butter and/or lard, and added to omelets or in breakfast burritos/tacos
* all of the above could be done with half ground meat and half rehydrated TVP
* TVP can be added straight to chili and stews to absorb their flavors and add protein.
* Larger chucks can be rehydrated with broth and seasonings, then breaded and fried into a nugget
* if you want to make patties, you need a binder like egg, wheat gluten, or aquafaba

Would love to hear your thoughts, and about your TVP sucesses and fails",1759731036.0,202,65,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet
1nz6iub,Quick Meal Ideas?,"I recently hit 265 lbs as a 6’7” man and decided I needed to get healthier. I’ve cut out sugary drinks almost entirely and replaced with diet counterparts(big vice of mine), started getting at least 30 minutes of exercise a day, started tracking calories, eating more fruits and veggies, and eating less overall. I’ve already seen progress and am now down below 260 after a few weeks. However the toughest part for me is that I’m honestly lazy which is a big reason I was gaining weight. I would get fast food or microwaveable foods that aren’t healthy at all. I currently haven’t really cut those types of foods out yet, just reducing the amount I eat, but I would ultimately like to limit those foods. So I would like to ask what are your favorite quick, cheap, and healthy meals to help make cooking healthier and easier transition?

1nyv0u2,Easy recipes for midweek meals for fussy family members,"Hi all,

I live in a house of 4. Unfortunately, 2 of which can be really fussy with anything remotely healthy or ""exotic"". We live in the UK and as much as we all love a good chinese/Indian/Thai etc, they can be quite fussy on anything different than the usual ""main stuff"" if that makes sense 🤣

I'm trying to get them to eat healthier while trying to think of things that they're likely to like or at least try that's also not going to take all day to make as I work full time Monday-Friday. 

Does anyone have any ideas/recipes/suggestions for incorporating healthier meal options rather just raiding the freezer for whatever is there? I don't mind trying longer meals of a weekend as I will cook those myself but I'm just mindful of midweek when it will be shared between us as to who cooks and there's only really one other person who can be relied upon to cook and they work during the week too. 

Sorry that's a bit of a ramble! I'm just a bit sick of getting to tea time and there being nothing planned or we end up ordering in more often than we should. 

Appreciate any advice people can offer 😊

Edit - just wanted to say a huge thanks to everyone kindly offering suggestions and tips.

She is free fed kibble (that's where the bulk of her nutrition comes from) and then twice a day she gets a little bit of canned food. This is how we hide her different supplements and medications she takes (she's an old gal.) I'm looking for ideas of how to cook it I guess to replace her canned food as I've never handled liver. Do I just boil it and blend it into a pate or something? Should I try to eat it instead of giving it to her?

1nvoada,Free Broth Bones at My Local Seafood Shop,"I called my local seafood mom n pop shop and asked if I could buy bones from them to make broth. They said they factor the waste into their accounting so they were happy to give them to me FREE. They sometimes sell tails for folks feeding their pets but the full carcasses just go in the trash. Y’all. I got home with two huge wild caught fish(a grouper and a halibut). About 15 pounds total — including one head and both tails. There was easily 5-6 lbs of MEAT to pick off the bones (so much left over after cutting filets!). This place charges upwards of $35/lb for their fish so I could absolutely not afford it. I ended up with about 6 quarts of bone broth and all that meat. All together this was easily worth a few hundred dollars. I did tip the lovely attendant who bagged up the fish for me and broke them down a little so I could carry them, and if I keep doing this I might see if they’d like a quart of broth each time. They said I could collect from them every week! They cut filets Thursday mornings and I can just call and let them know I’d like what they have.  I highly recommend reaching out to your local seafood establishments.

1nue2n8,Does anyone else realize they buy the same vegetables every grocery trip?,"Had a realization at the grocery store yesterday: I've bought broccoli and bell peppers for like... the 8th week in a row. I'm eating ""healthy"" but zero variety.

When I meal prep, I unconsciously buy the same proteins every trip too. Not the exact same meal every day, but definitely patterns - roughly 50% chicken, 25% beef, 25% fish over time. I only know this because I notice what I'm buying at the store.

But here's where it gets tricky: when I eat out, I'm *guessing* at what protein I should order. Did I have chicken three times this week already? Or was that last week? I end up either overthinking it or just ordering whatever sounds good.

Different vegetables and proteins provide different nutrients, so eating only broccoli and bell peppers is fine, but I'm probably missing out on nutrients from leafy greens, root vegetables, squash, etc.

**I'm curious - does anyone else notice this pattern in their own eating? How do you handle it?**

I've been thinking it would be helpful to somehow track variety (not micronutrients - too complex) but just see patterns like ""your protein this week: 60% chicken, 25% beef, 15% fish"" to help guide what to buy or order.

1njfxkn,Cottage pie,"One of my very favorite meals. Flexible, cheap, makes amazing leftovers. You will need a large, deep glass or ceramic baking tray. Fun fact: it's only SHEPHERD's pie if you use ground lamb, if you use beef it's cottage pie. If you use one of the other options below I have no clue what it's called, but it's still delicious.

Ingredients:

- 1 lb onion (~$1)

- 1 lb ground protein (super flexible here, can use beef, chicken, lamb, turkey, pork, or tofu) ($2-$4 depending on your choice)

- 1.5 cups beans (I like great northern or pinto, or a mix of the two) ($0.75)

- 3 lbs potatoes, any variety ($1.50)

- cheese of some description to mix into the potatoes (I like to use cotija or parmesan) ($0.5)

- 1.5 cups frozen vegetable mix (the kind with carrots/peas/corn/green beans, etc) ($0.5)

- 1/4 cup flour

Seasonings:

- boullion for the beans

- garlic powder

- onion powder

- worchestershire sauce

- red wine or red cooking wine

- salt & pepper

- balsamic vinegar

- basil

- thyme 

(estimate another buck for these)

Total cost: $7.25 - 9.25, makes at least 6 dinner-sized servings, so $1.20 - 1.54 a serving.

Steps:

1. (the night before) put beans in water to soak. Drain water and refill a couple of times. Bean water can be used as a mild fertilizer for your house plants :)

2. (several hours before) Boil potatoes until fork tender, 20-30 min depending on how large the potatoes are. Add a bit of butter, milk if you have it / potato water if you don't, mash thoroughly, add garlic powder, cheese, and salt to taste. Set aside and let cool. You want it nice and cool bc the best way to spread it on top is using your hands.

3. (2 hours before dinner) Put beans in a large stock pot with water, dried basil, and boullion, bring to a boil, reduce heat and let simmer for 1 hour. Set aside.

4. (1 hr before, when the beans are done) Finely dice onion and put in pan, brown ground meat in same pan (add a bit of butter if using a lower fat protein option like turkey/chicken/tofu). Season with garlic powder, salt, pepper, thyme. (If you used tofu, season a little more heavily.) Once meat is thoroughly cooked and onions are nice and transparent, add 1 cup red wine / cooking wine, 3 tbsp balsamic vinegar, 1 tbsp worchestershire sauce. Let simmer and reduce liquid by about half.

5. Add frozen vegetables and cooked beans. Mix thoroughly. Taste and evaluate your spicing, add more salt / garlic powder / pepper if needed. Mixture should be fairly soupy. When you are happy with the taste, add the flour, bring to a boil again and then promptly remove from heat.

6. Preheat oven to 375.

7. Pour mixture into your baking tray. Fetch the cooled mashed potatoes. I find the easiest way to create an even layer is to use my hands, get a handful of mashed potatoes, and press it into a flat disc between my hands, lay it on top, repeat. Then fill in the cracks between discs by hand. Once your potatoes are used up and the tray is completely covered with a flat, even layer of potato, sprinkle some extra cheese on top.

8. Put tray in oven for 40 min until top is browning. I recommend a cookie tray underneath in case of drips. Remove, let stand for a couple of minutes, and serve.


Substitutions / options:

- you can leave out the ground protein entirely and do 2 cups beans instead if desired

- this recipe is great for using up leftover produce. Got carrots, peppers, mushrooms, zucchini, squash, whatever left over from something else? toss it in, it'll taste great.

- other kinds of beans -- I haven't tried it with anything other than great northern and pinto, but I'm sure you could use just about anything, just make sure you are following the cooking instructions for whatever your bean of choice is

- canned beans would also be totally fine, I'd recommend cannellini, skip the bean cooking step in that case and just drain, rinse, and add",1758122136.0,76,37,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet

1ni68jx,Getting fiber the lazy way?,"\#edit: So nobody has actually addressed my question, they've just given a bunch of unrelated advice up to and including ""change everything about your diet"", which is not helpful. I am asking if there is any reason that getting almost all of your fiber this way would be a bad thing. I just wanted something easy, like a grab and go snack, that can be added to my routine as a way to get the necessary fiber.  Also since some people commented about it, Trubar contains a mix of soluble and insoluble fiber, and I believe Olipop is all soluble but haven't checked. Oh, and since I saw at least one person making wild assumptions, yes I eat vegetables. But commonly consumed vegetables don't contain anywhere near enough fiber, unless I want to consume my body weight each day in broccoli.

\#edit2: ""Garbage diet"" is probably overstated. I eat salads and other veggies and a variety of foods so I have no reason to believe I am lacking in any nutrients, just fiber. That's on my for using that phrase which probably made people think I eat nothing but McDonalds. 

\-----

So I recently learned that, as an adult male, I'm supposed to be eating 30-38 grams of fiber per day. Like most Americans, my fiber intake is nowhere near that amount. I wouldn't be surprised if my typical garbage diet averaged MAYBE 10g per day, and probably not even that much. I've tried supplementing my diet thus far with these vegan protein bars (Trubar) that happen to be extremely high in fiber (13g per 190 calorie bar), but I haven't felt a noticeable difference yet. That said, I'm obviously still well below the recommended value of fiber.

I mentioned to a friend that I was considering trying two of these bars per day to get my fiber content into the recommended range, and she suggested a can of this high fiber soda (Olipop) instead of a second protein bar. I only checked the nutritional information on one of the flavours, but it was 9g of fiber and 40 calories.

Anyway, my question is if there's anything wrong from getting the majority of your fiber from one or two sources like this? Obviously it would be better if I could upend my entire diet and start from scratch, but as a simple and relatively cheap way to supplement my diet, is there any reason that getting fiber this way would be a bad thing?",1757991688.0,382,414,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet

1nhqtmw,I’ve lost and maintained weight for a few years already. But I’ve done so in an unhealthy way. What are some sites that can calculate easy recipes to make with the necessary amount of macros and nutrition needed?,"

Back in 2023 around this time of the year exactly I was 230 lbs.

Dropped down to 189. I’m a male who’s 6’4 feet tall. 

Right now I’m at 195 and have stayed there all year. I was weightlifting for most of this past time frame but I stopped 4 months ago or so. Now I replaced weight lifting with running, which in enjoying more. Ran my first 5K 2 weeks ago actually. And do so 3 times a week. 

I’ve been told I look slimmer throughout the year despite being the same weight, maybe it’s the running?

Well anyway, to be honest I still eat junk food. I usually aim for 2,000-2,400 calories per day. Eat at a maintenance most of the time. 

I only eat twice a day, each meal being 1000-1200 calories each.

One meal is usually a meal from restaurants. Egg plates from local restaurants, wings with fries, triple meat burgers, tacos with chicken or sirloin and refried beans of the side etc. 

And the second meal is something I make home. Like a 1000 calories protein shake, pasta plate, meatballs, and such. 

I feel like I could add more healthier sides to my meals, more vegetables and healthier carbs. 

But I don’t know if it’s my  ADHD mind but I struggle with finding recipes that fit my macros perfectly. I also don’t have much time to cook super complicated meals that require a chunk to my day. It’s one of the reasons why I eat out once a day. Tend to have a busy schedule.

1nco476,"Black Bean Burgers (dried beans, no nuts, optionally vegan)","Kenji’s recipe got me hooked on black bean burgers. 

Unfortunately, every recipe I’ve found for black bean burgers either defaulted to canned beans or used nuts of some type.

I always keep dried beans on hand and never keep nuts, so making black bean burgers has historically costed the same if not more than just making beef burgers lol.

I’ve finally perfected a recipe I’m happy with after adapting a handful online. They taste super meaty and have somewhat decent macros. Here it is:

**Makes 5 patties** (I meal prepped these; they’re good and crispy right after, and they microwave very well.)

**Ingredients**

1.5 cup dried mixed black beans and lentils (I did around 1 cup black beans and 0.5 cups lentils, give or take)

¾ cup panko breadcrumbs

3tbsp onion, chopped (1/4 to 1/2 onion)

3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil

1 egg

2 tsp baking soda

1 quart of chicken stock (alternatively 3 bouillon cubes in 1 quart of boiling water)

Seasonings (ex. Ms. DASH southwest chipotle, seasoned salt, etc. Use whatever you want; I’m not a cop.)

¼ cup low sodium soy sauce

**Directions:**

•Soak beans for 1 hour with 1 tsp baking soda (I do a hot soak with boiling water)

•Drain the liquid, then pressure cook the beans for 20 minutes with 1 quart of chicken stock, the soy sauce, and the other 1tsp of baking soda. (If you have no pressure cooker, boil for an hour or until very soft.)

•Rinse and drain the beans well, then mash thoroughly

•Mix with everything else (egg, breadcrumbs, olive oil, onion, and any seasonings) and let sit in the fridge for 1 hour or overnight

•Form patties and cook in a pan on medium or so until well-seared.

**Notes:**

•If you’re using store bought stock, watch the sodium lol.

•When I originally scaled this up, I didn’t add fat before pressure cooking, and it boiled up through the pressure release hole. I added a tablespoon or so of olive oil and lowered the heat and it didn’t boil over after that.

•I cooked the patties on fairly low heat in a pan with olive oil, leaving it covered to make sure the egg got cooked. I had to off-gas steam periodically.

•**To make it vegan**, you could probably do more soy sauce or sub a mushroom-based broth to replace the chicken stock. Umami’s the goal here. And of course switch the egg for some other binder. I have not been able to replicate the texture without egg, though.

•In my experience, baking soda’s essential to ensure that the beans get soft enough!",1757436445.0,75,9,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet
1ncnk3g,Low sugar/minimal refined carb snacks for school kids?,"TLDR: in search of healthy(ish) snack ideas for picky kids who don't seem to like anything with protein/vitamins/fiber; school doesn't allow peanut products or ""messy"" snacks. 

Hey everyone, I'm looking for snack ideas for my kids (and myself) that are not just sugar/refined carbs. They can still contain *some* of those things, I would just prefer for them to also  have more nutritional value and keep us full for a bit longer (so protein, healthy fats, fiber, you name it). We're not on any kind of ""diet,"" only trying to eat a bit healthier... If anything my kids could use MORE calories, so I don't want to discourage them from snacking when hungry or take away options, just expand their horizons a bit by adding to the things they already enjoy.

The problem is, despite really trying since babyhood to get them to try different things, 2 out of 3 don't like yogurt or cheese of any kind (except on pizza/Mac & cheese), a different 2 out of 3 won't eat nuts of any kind, none of them will agree to eat jerky or deli meats. The littlest one *used* to like raisins and applesauce pouches but is now claiming she doesn't because her super cool older siblings say they're gross. 🤦‍♀️

To top things off, the school doesn't allow peanut products (for allergy reasons - understandable) OR  anything ""messy"" at snack time. This means no liquids other than water, no dips, sauces, fruit cups, etc. - nothing that would require use of a spoon or get hands excessively messy/sticky and potentially spill and make a mess on their work, clothes or the carpet. I get it. It's not the teacher's job to get Nutella out of someone's favorite shirt or ranch dressing out of the rug ...but what the heck is left? I'm literally at a loss of what to give them other than granola bars, potato chips, popcorn, pretzels, cookies, etc. So basically just carb bombs that have little or no nutritional value and leave them hungry again 20 minutes later. 

They also snack on these things at home, and I have no desire to be the ""almond mom"" who polices what my kids eat, but I do want to help them build healthier habits by adding some more protein, fruits, veggies, etc. into the mix. 

I'm open to any suggestions you may have and willing to do some amount of prep, but like once a week, not every day. Ideally at least some of the options would be relatively shelf-stable/grab-and-go (whether that's prepackaged, or me putting them in baggies) so I can put them in our ""snack cart"" for the kids to help themselves to when they're hungry. At least some pre-made/no prep options would be nice because, let's face it, I'm tired, lol. Bonus points of they're gluten-free because I have celiac and would love to have some more snack options, too, but it's not required.

I buy 6ish turkeys around Thanksgiving. In my area, they go for 50 cents a pound right near the holiday. I aim for 20lbs each. This puts me out about $60, which I realize is a bit. But...

I roast a turkey every couple of months. For that initial meal, I'm fairly traditional. But, afterwards (like 2-3 days later, let's be honest), I chop/shred all the leftover meat, and simmer it with taco seasoning. I mix my own, but packets are fine. I then freeze it in 2-cup portions. Last turkey I did, we had dinner with 7 folks total, and I still had 15 bags of 2-cup portions.

I use this meat for tacos, nachos, enchiladas... the weekly tex-mex meal and/or easy weekend lunches. When I'm exhausted, I can throw together nachos in 10 minutes and save us from running out for fast food. It's been wonderful. 

Also, there's no rule saying you must season the way I do. Leave some plain, or throw in Italian seasoning, or whatever you fancy. It's just been a great way for us to meal-prep and save money through the year.

1n4lstw,Vegan lunch box ideas ??,"So I’m the only vegan at my job and I truthfully cannot eat like most of the food we have available at my job besides like maybe bagels b joy even then we don’t have vegan cream cheese.

So basically, I’m looking for ideas for vegan lunch box ideas that are actually healthy.

1n3de56,Where is the line on the 80/20 rule?,"Love the concept of this in theory, but I just don't know if what I'm doing follows it. For me, there are some staple foods in my diet that are technically upf, but are not especially unhealthy and I kind of 'need' in a way. Mainly the bread I always have (50/50, 100cal 4g protien) , and chicken slices, which have one safe preservative and a small amount corn starch in them. If they are in the 80% I'm probably passing, otherwise definitely not. And what about sauces and seasonings.

For me typical day might look a bit like this

- breakfast one slice of toast with a large egg or some cottage cheese. 

- I tend to either eat lunch or have 2 foldover sandwiches a day, either way that's 2 more slices bread, and about 160g chicken chunks. Some sort of sauce on the sandwich. some yogurt or a buiscuit at the weekends sometimes. 

- I have at least a serving of fruit or veg to snack on.

- homecooked dinner - basically alway got a decent portion of meat Carb and 3 portions veg.

- a pudding, sometimes homebaked (but not one of those 3 ingredient really healthy things), sometimes ice cream or chocolate. Tend to go for something that's roughly 200cals, maybe a bit less.

- in the evening I'll have another foldover sandwich, maybe with ham this time. Or if there in the house, a yogurt bowl with low fat natural yogurt, fruit and own brand rice krispies. Could I use oats? Sure. Could I use coco pops? Also yes. Even if its upf I find krispies are a happy medium.

Obviously this is not every day exactly but it's often similar (on days I play sport I'll have an extra sandwich or something)

1mzzj7s,How to Increase Daily Caloric Intake?,"TW: Discussing daily cals/ measurements

Hi, y’all! 

I have recently been prioritizing healthy eating. At first, I was eating a lot of processed foods (LOTS of McDonalds), so I’ve switched to cooking at home/ buying healthy, whole foods. I haven’t been feeling much better—if anything, I’ve been feeling worse. I totaled up calories over the past week and here is what I found: 

Mon-Fri: average 800-1000 cals (walk 1.5 to 2 miles a day) Note: I take vyvanse, which makes me forget to eat. I don’t normally think to eat until 3-6 pm

Sat-Sunday: average ~ 1400-1700 cals (usually walk 3-4 miles a day, but was 6 miles this last Saturday bc we walked around the city). I do not take vyvanse on these days. 

General diet: I don’t eat a lot of meat (I was vegan, so I don’t eat much meat in general. The texture freaks me out and I don’t know how to cook it). Last week, I had a can of tuna and half a serving of salmon total. I eat a lot of veggies/ whole grains/ olive oil/ eggs (eggs are my favorite food lol)

Other information: I am a 23F, 5’10, and 125 lbs (I was 130 before starting to eat healthier, so I don’t think I’m getting enough food, but idk how to increase daily cals without needing to increase how often I eat. Even without vyvanse, I don’t usually get hungry until about 1 pm).

I have been not feeling well overall. I have a lot of brain fog/ memory loss. I am supplementing D3, K2, magnesium, and fish oil (labs came back low for D and I heard other supplements listed can help with absorption). I have no energy, and my memory/ mood is getting worse, which is very disheartening since I’ve been putting in so much effort to improve my health and hopefully fix those things. Today, I tried to eat a slice of pie during work to up my cals, and now I feel nauseous and even more fatigued. If anyone has any tips, please let me know!

Chicken rice soup -- basically the same thing but with rice

Chicken risotto -- basically chicken rice soup but thicker

Chicken pot pie -- basically the same flavor profile in a pie

Chicken and dumplings -- same flavor profile but with lumps of dough instead of rice or pasta or noodles

Matzo ball soup -- similar flavor profile to the chicken and dumplings

The above recipes are highly similar to each other in terms of ingredients used and flavor profile but they differ in the type of starchy food. And the starchy food may be wheat-based or rice-based. 

The following are similar in the sense that they are chicken-stock-based, but then the ingredients change and the flavor profile also change. 

面疙瘩鸡汤 - similar to chicken and dumplings with a different shape to the dumpling, different use of ingredients (often native ingredients found in the country), less thick than the chicken and dumplings because American Southerners (where the chicken and dumplings are known for) like to use dairy products to make a roux as a thickener and dairy products aren't that common in Chinese cuisine to the extent that foreigners may have to get certain cheeses through Hong Kong or through direct imports, but overall, pretty similar (you got the chicken-flavored soup and dough clumps) - the literal translation of the name into English sounds unappetizing though so I'm not going to translate that

>Tessier, AJ., Wang, F., Korat, A.A. *et al.* Optimal dietary patterns for healthy aging. *Nat Med* **31**, 1644–1652 (2025). [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03570-5](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03570-5)

I tried various vegetarian and vegan chicken substitutes and love them, however the substitutes I've found are still heavily processed, hyperpalatable, relatively high calorie density and relatively high in saturated fats.

I thought I better get behind tofu. However, I really dislike the taste. Despite me drinking a lot of soy milk, I don't taste any resemblance. Tofu seems to have a sort of chemical taste like eating a rubber product, rather than the umami chicken taste. I usually cover tofu in pepper and some arbitrary spices, fry them in a table spoon of oil, and mix them with a tomato based sauce and vegetables. Sometimes I'll throw them in a wrap. But still the tofu taste is overpowering. Is there a preparation method that can help?",1755881006.0,23,80,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet
1mx5pfj,"Tried making Greek yogurt, where did I go wrong?","Hi all, so I eat tons of Greek yogurt and saw online that yogurt should be easy-ish to make at home, so I tried it for the first time last night, and my yogurt came out looking more like cottage cheese, but tasting like a very mild yogurt (no tartness at all, but not cheese tasting). Does anyone know what I did wrong to get it yogurt textured next time I try making it?

Here’s what I did for those wanting to know:
1) heated ~4 cups regular 2% milk up to 180°F on the stove stop, stirring constantly and on low heat (took like an hour total)
2) let the milk cool to 110°F then stirred in the store-bought Greek yogurt (~1/2 cup)
3) poured the milk-gurt into two jars, put the lids on, and turned my toaster oven on the warm setting (110°) and let them sit overnight in there (~9/10 hours total)
4) poured out into strainer this morning.

Also, if anyone knows what the heck to do with a cup and a half of liquid whey please lmk. Thanks all!

1mu48c4,So Easy So Good by Kylie Sakaida - Worth Every Cent,"For the last 4 months, I've been feeding my family out of the book: So Easy So Good by Kylie Sakaida. I first got interested in her through shorts on youtube (she has an insta as well). Her philosophy on healthy eating has been a part of my ""weight loss through better eating"" journey. She has been a piece of what has given so much information on nutrition and also ideas & recipes for good eating. Her teriyaki recipe (not in the book) has become a staple in my home, as have the jar soups in her book (also on her account).

So I was thrilled when she announced her cookbook. It's been 4 months since I started using it for almost every dinner. When I'm not, I use her guide on how to build a plate + information on nutrition to plan whatever meals I am making. A lot of picky eaters in my house, and they've gotten along splendidly with the recipes! She gives suggestions for substitutions for every recipe, which are a handy thing when there are a lot of textural concerns at play.
Not only are the recipes wonderful and genuinely easy to make, there is also a trove of nutritional information broken down into easily digestible (pun intended) segments throughout! Including food myths & common questions (like what's up w/ ""super foods""?). There's also advice on grocery shopping without a list, and pantry building.
I cannot recommend this book enough to everyone wanting to learn how to create healthy meals on a budget and with little skill involved. Easy meal prep too!

Even if you're not able to purchase this book, go check out her accounts! She has many wonderful recipes up for free! And so much advice! She understands struggles with eating and with cooking/planning. Very sensory & disabled friendly! And so so delicious!

My favorite book recipes are her kale ceaser salad (I bake the kale to get crispy), literally any of the mason jar soups, nachos, and the white beans & tomatoes dish (I use Italian seasoning lol).

~~~~~~~~~~

HER TERIYAKI SAUCE RECIPE:
Ingredients:
Sake, mirin, sugar, soy sauce, ginger, water as needed (I cook for 6 ppl)

You'll get a feel for the right measurements. I can't even explain it bc I eyeball it 😅
Mix these in a bowl. Start conservative with the sake. Taste as ya go.

To Use:
- Cook whatever you want in a pan. Chicken thighs (heavenly in this, and what she uses), veggies, other meats, tofu, quorn, etc.
- Pour in the sauce. Cook on ~med until it reduces, making sure to spoon it over the food as you go.
- Ta-da! It's done! Serve over a little rice (I mix quinoa into mine for extra protein, we usually eat jasmine or basmati rice in my household), and with steamed or baked veg! I personally make enough sauce to get it on my side vegetable as well. 👌

""When preparing these grains according to traditional methods, such as those provided in Nourishing Traditions, the best idea is to add one or more tablespoons of freshly ground rye flour. Rye flour contains high levels of phytase that will be activated during the soaking process. ... Even without the rye flour, overnight soaking of oats and other low-phytase grains greatly improves digestibility but won’t eliminate too much phytic acid. ... You can keep whole rye grains and grind a small amount in a mini grinder for adding to these grains during the soaking process."" (https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/vegetarianism-and-plant-foods/living-with-phytic-acid)

* I've struggled with gaining weight my whole life (genetics + eating habits at home)
* I lift every 2 days consistently (started again a month ago after being inconsistent)
* Protein isn't an issue: I eat a lot of nuts and have a shake with \~40g protein daily
* I take 3–5g of creatine daily
* The problem: I can't hit my carbs (360g) and overall calories (2900g) consistently

Some extra context:

* I can't really cook yet
* I dislike milk and bananas
* Avocado isn't my favorite, but I could try to get used to it
* My parents aren't super supportive — they just tell me to ""eat more bread"" and don't really understand why I want to eat differently
* I don't want to go full junk food, but I'm okay with not eating 100% clean if it helps me gain weight

My questions:

1. What are some easy, calorie-dense carb sources that don't require much cooking?
2. Any tips for convincing my parents to support me more (e.g. buying certain foods or letting me handle some of my own meals)?
3. Any personal hacks?

1mr0fw3,Request for recipes for heart patient,"About a year ago, my dad collapsed in the street from a heart attack — we almost lost him. He needed extensive surgery and long-term care, but eventually, he pulled through and even returned to work. For a while, he was slowly recovering. But now, his health seems to be declining again. Alongside his heart problems, he's been dealing with hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol — conditions he was only recently officially diagnosed with, but that I suspect he's had for as long as I can remember.

My mum, who handles all the cooking, isn’t exactly what you'd call a cooperative patient. She’s a bit of a narcissist and refuses to believe she’s ever wrong. The food she makes is, frankly, awful — heavy with oil or ghee. We’re a South Asian family, so rice is a twice-daily staple, and potatoes are practically mandatory with every meal. On top of that, both of my parents are convinced that chicken and eggs are toxic, so they’re completely banned from the house. Yes, it’s ridiculous — but arguing only makes things worse.

Both my parents work full-time, and I’m a student who also works, so time is tight. When I ask my mum to cook something healthier, she takes it as a personal attack and snaps with the usual: “If you don’t like it, do it yourself.” The thing is, I want to cook — I just never had the time or guidance to really learn.

I guessed the proportions and used 3 whole eggs. I don’t like them overly filled, so I used 1.5 yolks and gave the rest of the yolks to my dogs which they loved. To the remaining 1.5 yolks, I added 2 Tbs Greek yogurt, chopped up one Claussen pickle sandwich slice, 1 tsp Dijon mustard, a dash of salt and pepper, and 1 Tbs of minced chives. 

They turned out great both in texture of the filling and taste. I didn’t miss the Mayo at all. And for a bonus, I’ll use the leftover Greek yogurt for dessert with a couple tablespoons of Hershey’s chocolate syrup mixed in. ",1755088542.0,52,16,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet
1mouizk,Watermelon Whole Fruit Popsicles,"Watermelon Whole Fruit Popsicles

Perfect for hot days. You can swap the watermelon puree for honeydew or cantaloupe, or mix and match with whatever fresh organic fruit you’ve got. I love using contrasting colors so every pop looks like edible art it’s so much fun. Bonus tip: seedless watermelon makes life easier, but seeds are not the end of the world.

Ingredients
	•	3 cups watermelon puree (about ¼–½ of a medium watermelon)
	•	½ cup fresh blueberries
	•	½ cup chopped fresh strawberries
	•	1 kiwi, peeled and sliced
	•	1 peach or nectarine, diced
	•	Small handful fresh cherries, pitted and chopped

Directions
	1.	Cut the watermelon into chunks and blend until completely smooth. Set aside.
	2.	Lay out about 12 popsicle molds (you might need more or less depending on size).
	3.	Drop the chopped fruit into each mold—layer them for a prettier look.
	4.	Pour the watermelon puree over the fruit until each mold is full.
	5.	Insert popsicle sticks and freeze for 6–8 hours, or until solid.
	6.	Run the molds under warm water for a few seconds to release your colorful frozen masterpieces.

Bonus Fruit Combo Ideas:
	•	Tropical Glow: Mango, pineapple, kiwi, passion fruit puree.
	•	Berry Blast: Raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberry puree.
	•	Citrus Sunrise: Orange slices, grapefruit, blood orange puree.
	•	Peachy Dream: White peach, nectarine, honeydew puree.
	•	Exotic Mix: Dragon fruit, lychee, papaya puree.

So I got to thinking, and realized these drinks are essentially green tea and some type of juice. I went to my local Publix and picked these items up:

•Any type of tea (I chose a caffeinated Green tea) 
•Any type of liquid flavoring (which are usually 0 calories!)

I steep the tea in a mug, and poured over ice once it’s cooled down enough. Add in the flavoring, and it’s done! If you’re in a rush you can add the hot tea to about a 3/4ths cup of ice. I sometimes like to add half a probiotic soda (Dr D’s Sparkling Apple is my personal favorite). What I like about this drink is that you can personalize it as much or as little as you want! I thought this was a fun, cost effective and healthy way to spice up my tea drinking habits and still satiate my refresher cravings! 

The box of tea came with 20 packets and cost me about $4 and the flavoring I got cost $4, but I can make multiple servings over a span of time, instead of dropping $3/$4 on just one refresher at Dunkin.

I've been a vegetarian for quite a while but feel like I never really learned to eat vegetarian properly if that makes sense? I was warned when I went veggie that toast and butter is vegetarian but wasn't necessarily good for me and I fear I've fallen into that trap a bit. 

I struggle with finding the time or energy to make nice meals after work or doing anything nice for breakfast/lunch when I'm at home so things that can be batch prepped when I do have the time would probably be helpful. 

In the mornings I normally just have cereal or instant noodles, occasionally oats or a sandwich. 
For lunch it's generally either noodles with some extra seasoning, egg + cheese wraps or something like that. 
My usual dinner rotation is something like mac and cheese with broccoli/pasta with mushrooms+halloumi/veggie burgers/sunday roast with quorn, yorkshire pudding, veg, gravy/mushroom soup with garlic bread. 

It's a diet that's not super nutritious and is fairly lacking in fruit + veg which has lead to a lot of problems with weight gain since I started. 

My main issues I feel are:

- Not wanting to have to prep things or chop things during the day (breakfast/lunch while I WFH) - I find it's a mental barrier that I find quite hard to get over when there's something easier available. Because of the lack of proper food I feel it's impacting my energy levels a bit too which is a bit of a vicious circle.

- For dinners, my boyfriend is somewhat picky about texture and taste - he's not a fan of new stuff and doesn't really like leafy greens, tomatoes, rice or spice which limits things a bit. Curries would be my go to for getting nutrition in (or like rice+beans or dhal) but that's not really on the table.

1mfxpyt,Easy chicken but you need an air fryer,"This is geared towards drumsticks and thighs.  I buy them in bulk when they are on sale.  That being said, here is how I do:

Separate chicken into portions in freezer safe bags.  I put 2 drumstick or 2 thighs per bag.  

Twist - Either freeze them as is and season when you thaw them, or season them before you freeze them.  Both work.

I thaw one bag.  I pour in olive oil then add whatever spices I want.  The only ""spice"" i've ever added too much of is salt.  Here are a few ideas:

Cajun chicken - season salt, honey, red pepper, onion powder, garlic powder

Simple chicken - salt and pepper

BBQ chicken - salt, whatever bbq sauce you have on hand

Okay, so I have a thawed bag of chicken with spices on top.  I close the bag and shake/massage it so all the chicken is covered.  Then I pour it into the air fryer.  My air fryer makes it so I only have to press 3 buttons.  On, Air fry, Start.  The precepts are 390F for 20 minutes.  I walk away and when I return 20+ minutes later, I have chicken.

This is for dark meat.  If you want to do it with breast meat, you will need to lower the cook time.  14-18 minutes maybe.  Closer to 14.  Dark meat doesn't have the draw back of being dry like white meat does.",1754159528.0,106,24,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet

1meamyy,looking for whole-grain recipe suggestions that are really uncomplicated (& in text format),"Hi everyone.

I've recently been trying to cook more (very hard for my AuDHD self) and would also like to start eating some more whole grains for my health. Obviously I've tried internet searches for this, but most of the recipes I found were quite involved in terms of prep/steps and making them used up way too many of my spoons for the day. Since I'm a very beginner cook I'd also like to avoid potentially wasting expensive ingredients due to lack of practice, so I figured this would be a good sub to ask in.

>I'd be grateful for any recipe suggestions that include whole-grain something and don't involve a ton of steps, ideally also no over-night prep. Wait times are fine. **In text format please**, recipe videos don't work for my brain at all.

As far as my diet goes I'm an omnivore, but some restrictions apply:

\- I can't have much soy (tofu etc), but edamame and soy sauce are fine.

\- Nothing too lactose-heavy, I also don't like cream sauces much.

\- No sandwich recipes, I don't eat whole-grain bread for gut and sensory reasons.

\- Not a huge pork fan. Other meat is fine, I love most fish & seafood.

Also, I would love vegetarian or vegan recipes! Recipes with canned fish are also very welcome as it's an easy protein-source for me.

Thank you for reading and any recipe suggestions. :)

Edit to add some clarification:

My problem with simply doing ""whole grain swaps"" is that most of the dishes I like with e.g. white-flour past do not taste good to me anymore with whole-grain substitutions. (Not sure why that is, but so far has held true for almost every dish where I've tried.)

*However* most of the times I make or am served a dish that is originally *meant* to have full-grain \[e.g. pasta\], it tastes good to me and even tastes worse when I don't use full-grain stuff to make it. So that's why I'm asking for recipes instead of just swapping out my rice and pasta and calling it a day.",1753989345.0,9,69,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet

1mcytos,"Easy and Delicious High Protein LOW FIBER Meals? (Please help, this is affecting my relationship 🙏)","This is a strange ask, but I'm looking for your go-to meals that are high in protein but **LOW IN FIBER!!!**

Basically, I (26F) eat around 50-60 grams of fiber a day pretty much completely on accident. I just REALLY love berries and lentils and beans and veggies, and most of my staple go-tos revolve around those. I don't try to eat this much fiber, I find it much harder to hit my protein goals, but lentils and beans for example are cheap, easy to have around for a while without worrying about them going bad, and are DELICIOUS. The insane amount of fiber I eat is simply a byproduct.

You may be asking, so what? Good for you for getting enough fiber, most Americans don't! WRONG. The horrible consequence of my fibrous diet is that I have gotten very, **VERY** gassy. Like really gassy. My fiancée has been complaining and it has only gotten more tense over time. I simply CANNOT control how much I fart. It's actually bad. She says that every time she enters the bathroom it is like entering a horrendous war zone. She recently asked a doctor what c. diff. smells like because she is concerned for me. I am farting as I write this. (Weekly diarrhea may or may not also be involved but I won't expand upon that further).

Before my diet was like this I did not have a problem. My relationship was completely smooth sailing. Besides this issue my life is picture perfect. So I am begging anyone, what are your most delicious high protein low fiber meals?? The thing is, I have high standards for taste. Don't mean to brag but I'm a pretty great cook. So if you tell me to just boil some chicken breast that really does not help me. Fibrous foods just taste really goddam good (pardon my French). Thank you for helping save my (future) marriage.

  
EDIT: Thank you all for the replies! I should have clarified that this has been going on for a while, it's been at least about 6-9 months since I increased my fiber intake. I recently got a colonoscopy/endoscopy for an unrelated reason and those came back squeaky clean, so I'm not too concerned about this on a health level at the moment. I also think I have probiotics covered as I eat greek yogurt like an absolute BEAST on the regular (I do love kombucha tho will take any excuse for some booch).

Context:
 For a little context, me and my partner are severely struggling to find a healthy balance for our food needs. I can survive off chicken and rice every night without much complaints, while my partner can't stand eating the same meal two nights in a row.  We've been either eating out to not have to cook, or when we do cook at home, we make premium meals that we can't afford, and have to go right back to the store 1 to 2 days after. We're spending a fortune on food right now.

With that all out of the way, I had my eureka moment last night on how to have the best of both worlds; bowls of rice or pasta  with varying ingredients to keep it both cheap, consistent, easy, and also have variety.

1m3gpux,Words of wisdom,"This is a small quote from a book written in the late 1700's, during another time when people were struggling to make ends meet and get some food on the table. Shoutout to the Townsends YouTube channel. There is a lot of great stuff on there about people who were trying to eat cheap and healthy in a past age. Much of which is still applicable or could be adapted now.

This doesn't all work in this day and age but I would submit that the spirit still stands. As well I have been giving thought about the this vs that aspect as it would apply today.

The difference between eating new and stale bread is 1 loaf in 5. If you turn your meat into broth, it will go farther than if you roast it or bake it. If you have a garden, make the most of it. A bit of leek or an onion makes all dishes savory at small expense. If the money spent on fresh butter were spent on meat, Families would be much better fed than they are. If money spent on tea were spent on home brewed beer the wife would be be better fed, the husband better pleased, and both would be healthier. 

Keep a little scotch barley, rice, dried peas, and oatmeal in the house. They are all cheap and don't spoil. Keep also pepper and ginger. 

Pay your debts, serve God, love your neighbor.

The cottage cook.

1lx21gg,"Apparently, legumes and grains are overpowered.","The title, basically. I decided to learn cooking and started budget eating 7 months ago (1st of jan). Since then, I have been mostly eating the following:

Grains  
Legumes

  
Yeah that is it. I expected to have a variety diet with creative recepies that would keep me healthy and on budget. But after two months, I had realised that the most effective strategy was to eat legumes and grains. I would eat mainly/only those for 4-7 days a week, and I still do :D

Nothing comes close to the grain+legume combo. Here are the things I favor the most:  
Bulgur (middle eastern wheat rice) + chickpeas/lentils (vegetables optional)  
Rice + chickpeas/beans (vegetables optional)  
Kesme (middle eastern noodle) + lentils as soup  
Green beans + vegetables (like vegetable soup, but not a soup)

These things were my staples the whole way through. And they are extremely cheap. The kesme+lentil combo especially! It is about the same cost as bread, you just need a stove and that's it. These take some time, but you can wait for most of that. And even as a student, I can confidently say that time has not a problem for me. Just spend 5 minutes setting it up and check back 15 minutes later, thats it!

And when it comes to the ""healthy"" part... actually, this is not perfect. The advantage is that legumes have most nutrients in common, so I won't be deficient in any of the ones they share. The problem is that they have most nutrients in common, so there are some micros that I won't be able to get enough of through this combo. But even when I was already months into this diet, my blood readings were OK. This may not be the case for everyone, I dont know honestly :P",1752224457.0,342,92,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet

1lvvclq,How to make Protein Powder Palatable?,"Long story short: 
I really don’t like protein shakes, but they’re my best bet to improve my protein intake. How do you guys make yours taste better and have a better consistency? My current protein powder is a basic whey powder with light vanilla flavoring.


Long story long:
So I’m really trying to eat healthier and cheaper (I know, I know, we all are here)! My job makes it difficult as I could work hours without a set “meal break”. 

During the time I’m on shift I have zero access to a refrigerator or oven/microwave. I will spend multiple days away from home staying at hotels overnight. So I have access to a minifridge at night, and sometimes a microwave. I do carry an insulated lunchbox with me.

All this means I have limited space to bring food with me and I prefer non-perishable, ready to eat foods. I decided protein shakes were the cheapest, healthiest, easiest way to up my protein intake on trips.

They’re pretty gross though! I can’t afford to really experiment with brands and flavors, so I have to just make what I have work. I already invested in an actual protein shaker bottle and bag of powder, a basic whey protein with some vanilla flavoring. 

I’m sadly chugging my protein shakes right now and they just…are depressing? I feel like I’m in a dystopian story where the character survives on government dispensed sludge slurry while working as another overworked cog in the machine. I’m sneaking sips of my BlandCo meal replacement between long hours of work and it is Not Great TM.

How to y’all make them more palatable? Are there cheap/healthy ways to make them easier to drink I could store easily and bring with me on trips? I want it to at least not feel like a chore to choke down these shakes!",1752097605.0,21,67,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet

1ltyeto,HOME MADE BROTH : does it work with mussel shells?,"Last year, this group convinced me that making broth from a rotisserie chicken is EASY, and a great way to stretch the purchase into multiple meals. You all were very generous with your experience and advice about simmering times, the necessity or luxury of skimming off the scum, how useful it is to add vegetable scraps, the clever use of my freezer both to prep and to preserve...

Now I'm back with a question about mussels shells!

It's summer here, and mussels are one of my favourite seafoods, and I really like the broth in the bottom of the pot: the briny liquid from the mussels, the savoury stewed celery onion and garlic, the cracked black pepper... <3

That's why I indulge from time to time. After my meal tonight, I started wondering if I could make a separate broth out of them?

I'm hesitant. You know : I can see that a chicken carcass has, you know, cartilage and skin and sinews and small shreds of meat I didn't fully pluck (e.g. off the neck), so it makes sense that that stuff infuses into a chicken broth. But what can mussels shells bring? They're mostly calcium, right? And that tiny fiber at the ""hinge"" between the 2 halves...

Would it be worth it to try to make broth with them?

(I'm leaving my flat tomorrow morning, so I feel it doesn't make sense to experiment tonight, and I have to own up that I don't like surprises, so I'd prefer to benefit from your advice again, if you're willing to share)",1751905018.0,17,20,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet

1lseaa9,Extending Meat - Tips & Tricks!,"I know the cost of groceries is going up, and it’s not going to get any better. Especially with the various funding cuts that are happing in the US (food stamps etc).  So I wanted to share a trick that I do often to extend meat.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
You can do this with any type of meat – ground meats, or diced up chicken/turkey/pork tenderloin etc.  My diet borders on Pescatarian, so when I do this, I freeze it in individual portions, so that I have it ready to go.  I’ll then add it to salads, or have it with a carb (potatoes, rice etc) and other veggies.  Add some sauce and you have a full meal! 
 
This example is with Ground Beef.  It will probably last me a few months (in the freezer) as I don’t eat beef very often but still like to have it as an option in case I want to do a burger bowl or rice bowls or something.
 
I worked it out to 9 servings (/100g of cooked food), the overall cost per serving for this (in Canadian) is $2.00.  The price of the veggies is approx. since I buy a few at a time, and I am not including spice cost.   All prices are in CAD.
 
It’s a great way to extend your food and budget.  It’s very versatile, and you can change whatever you want to extend it, or add additional things.
 
1) 100g dry lentils* - $1.40 CAD**
-Boil/cook up lentils in broth or water (I did these in beef broth to add some additional meat flavor)

*You can sub the lentils for beans if you want.  Black beans would go great with beef.  I’ve done diced pork tenderloin with pinto beans or Romano beans, and cannellini beans with diced chicken.
**I splurge and get French or Beluga Lentils because I prefer them over the others.  Cost is $14.00 for 1,000g/1KG.  So you can reduce the cost further if you get “cheaper” lentils or beans
 
2) 1 lb extra lean ground beef - $9.00 CAD
Cook up Ground or diced up meat, drain any fat from cooked meat and remove from pan.
 
3) 1 lb of diced Cremini Mushrooms $4.00 CAD

4) 100g diced peppers $1-2.00 CAD

5) 200g onion $1-2.00 CAD

Sauté the above together in the pan until moisture is out and mushrooms have reduced.  I’ve done zucchini, diced cabbage, corn, peas, carrots etc with chicken and pork before.  Add whatever veggies you want.  I find that Beef and mushrooms go best together. 
 
Add the cooked meat and lentils to the pan of cooked down veggies.  

Add whatever spices you want (I did some pepper, smoked paprika, tomato paste, garlic powder).  I like to keep spices basic, so that I can use the meat for a variety of things,. I.E if I want to add a sauce, or turn the meat into Mexican flavored meat, or Korean BBQ bulgogi or something, the existing spices overpower that.
 
 
Anyways, I see people all the time saying that you can extend pasta meat sauce etc with lentils, and I wanted to give an example of that, but not as pasta, but as just a regular meat option.

Please share your tips below too!  

PS. If I could share a picture of what I made I would.

I really want to start eating healthier especially because i've had a lot of digestive issues and mood issues and energy issues and I'm tired of being tired.

For fruits, i only like Apples and watermelon (if they aren't gritty.)  
Another thing that doesn't help is i absolutely hate cheese or creamy things. Not the texture this time (surprisingly), I just can't handle having too much cheese on anything.

I eat a fairly good diet, Eggs, natural foods, sourdough, wholemilk, fruit, etc. I typically don't have cravings either and the treat at night is just because I feel like I need it but I really don't and sometimes don't even enjoy it.

1lgmpia,Soybeans from an Asian grocer may be one of the cheapest options possible for your macros,"Soy is a nutritional powerhouse and a staple in many Asian diets. Tofu and its many variants, edamame, textured vegetable protein, soymilk, soybean oil, soy flour, and so on. The vast majority of soy produced goes to feeding cattle so they get big and strong and produce milk. [Only 7% is consumed by humans.
](https://www.developmentaid.org/news-stream/post/165992/top-5-soybean-producing-countries)

Soybean differ from other beans in that it has almost no starch content. This gives it an incredibly low glycemic index of 15. For context, pasta is around 55 while rice is around 70, because they are high in starch. However, the biggest selling point for soybeans is its incredible protein content, at 36%; this is 50% higher than lentils, and is the highest out of all legumes. On top of that, soy protein is ""complete"" for humans, though it's always good to mix up proteins from vegetable sources for a balanced amino acid profile.

Soybeans are much higher in fat than other beans at 20%. However, it is mostly polyunsaturated & monounsaturated fats, including omega-6 and some omega-3. Sound familiar? They're the same ""healthy"" fats that are avocados' claim to fame as a health food.

Soybean also stand out from other common legumes for its significantly higher calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc content. As far as beans go, none pack as much nutritional value as soy.

The US is the second largest producer of soy in the world, first being Brazil. Unfortunately, there is not a great demand for soy in the US, so despite the massive production, it is a niche product. Prices online are all quite ridiculous, ranging anywhere from $3-7 per pound. However, Asian grocery stores may carry these in bulk, and that's where they can become an incredibly cheap source of macronutrients for your diet. My local Asian grocer sells them for $0.99/lb.

If you have a pressure cooker, 20 minutes on high submerged in water cooks them perfectly. If just boiling, they'll need to be soaked beforehand. They have a mild flavor and creamy texture, and can be substituted into most dishes that call for some other variety of beans. They can also be blended into a thick shake as a meal replacement. Let's compare 90g of soybeans to one bottle of Soylent:

 . | Soybeans | Soylent
---|---|----
Quantity | 90g | 1 bottle
Calories | 401 | 400
Carbs | 18.8g | 37g
Protein | 32.8g | 20g
Fat | 17.9g | 24g

When equating the calories, Soylent has double the carbs, nearly 50% more fat, and only 60% of the protein. On top of that, one bottle costs $3.50 from the website *with* the subscription discount, while 90g of soybeans would cost me $0.20, so Soylent costs 17x more for worse macros. I know ""meal replacement"" drinks are low-hanging fruit when talking about eating cheap as they are never cost-effective, but the difference in nutrients is also much larger than one might expect - I was surprised myself looking up the data when writing this post.

I blended up 100g of soybeans with water and drank it tonight. Homemade meal replacement shake. No additives, dirt cheap, filling, easy, low glycemic impact, can be easily carried to work, full of protein and healthy fats. Eating cheap and healthy doesn't have to be hard.

1lgmomd,"Get More Out of Bone in, Skin on Chicken Thighs","My grocery store used to have boneless skinless chicken thighs for 2$/lb when on sale, and bone in skin on thighs for 1$/lb. Recently, even on sale, boneless skinless thighs have gone up to 2.50$/lb or even 3$/lb. However, bone in skin on thighs have stayed the same, and after a little tinkering I have realized they are fantastic deal as they allow me to replace a few other purchases. You can easily make a chicken stock with the bones- most of the packs I get have around 6 thighs, which yield 6 thigh bones. Combined with an old onion, carrot, and some celery (or whatever stock scraps you have around)  you can make 3-4 cups of stock, which is usually enough for a soup, stew, or other dish that calls for stock. 

The skins make an excellent bacon replacement. I marinate both the skins and some of the thighs in yogurt, salt, and spices, and then lay the skins and any trimmings on an insulated baking tray at ~375 F. Give them 12-15 minutes or so (you will need to check them for your ideal level of crisp) and you should be left with a nice crispy meaty chunk of skin that makes a fantastic bacon substitute without any of the chemicals. Additionally most of the chicken fat is in the skin and trimmings of the thighs- from 6 thighs I got well over 1/3 of a cup of schmaltz! Plenty to cook with. I pour it off from the pan into a pyrex measuring cup, let it cool, then pour it into a jar with an airtight lid and put it in the fridge. 

Finally you have the chicken thighs. I did an experiment and at 1$/lb, you get chicken thigh meat at roughly 1.80$/lb which is still cheaper than the original price of boneless skinless thighs on sale, and it only takes maybe 20 minutes of prep to separate the components and get everything marinating and whatnot.",1750475779.0,315,41,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet

But it’s officially too hot for oatmeal, so I feel like I’m back at square one.

I want something to store in the freezer rather than the fridge because I like that it’s pre-portioned and because I fall off the breakfast habit easily (so leftovers/meal prep in the fridge often goes bad). I’m hoping for a breakfast that’s high protein, high fiber, and has moderate fat.

Thought someone here might appreciate my favorite oatmeal recipe, made better with the tech-advantaged Instant Pot, so here goes:

4-5 cups water
a pinch of salt 

Optional:
1/4 cup dried currants or raisins
or 
1/2 cup fresh fruit, chopped 

Throw it all in the Instant Pot on “Porridge” setting, allow natural pressure release.

Stir well when you open, add 2 tablespoons toasted flax meal for a flavor and nutrition boost, and maple syrup to taste if desired, transfer what you don’t eat to a storage container. I love the creamy texture!

I eat one cup per morning, heated in the microwave, lasts 4-5 days.

1ldmcew,How to hide veggies into your food even if you don’t like veggies,"This might not work for everyone and some might say it is obvious but as picky eater myself with a kid I want to share some ways how I get more vegetables into our diet without changing the taste of the food too much.

- Meatballs: 
I usually chop leftover vegetables from previous meals (broccoli, spinach, shredded carrots, lentils, mushrooms…) and prepare it as normal. I sometimes I add feta cheese too. 

- Mashed potatoes: 
I often add a bit of red lentils and / or carrots / peas. Once mixed together they might taste slightly differently but my main issue is texture of food im picky about which in mashed form wont be different from normal potatoes.

- Spinach / beet pasta or dumplings: 
If you make those yourself at home just add spinach or red beetroot mixed with water/milk/eggs into the dough 

- Desserts with vegetable in it: 
You already know carrot cake. But what about zucchini sponge chocolate cake? I did it multiple times and if I didnt tell others there is zucchini inside no-one had noticed. It adds nice juiciness to the batter.
I also heard of bean cakes too but I haven’t tried those yet but I can see it working.

- Creamy soups: 
I come from culture where soups are part of every lunch. Yet I don’t make them a lot because I only like very limited amount of soups and I prefer thick creamy over watery ones. 
I often make a vegetable broth and if there are veggies I struggle with texture-wise I will keep them in the soup while I put rest to the side and blend the veggies in the pot with the broth. Then I put back the veggies I like and serve 

- Omelette: 
Chop them tiny and add on the on with the eggs at the same time. I tried it with bell peppers, mushrooms, spinach, broccoli. It will change texture and yes you can taste them in the omelette but if it is easier than eating them on their own then you should try it.

- Rice: 
If you have a rice cooker just drop some frozen peas/corn/chopped carrots/broccoli in with the rice. Or add them from can to freshly cooked rice and have it as a side to some meat or tofu. Yea you will see and taste them but I never had any problem with it despite not being fan of peas or broccoli.

- Bake them and blend into sauce: 
Bake bell peppers, tomatoes, zucchini and garlic on high temperature in the oven and then throw them into blender (get rid of burnt skin if appears). Add oat or cow milk / hummus / pesto or just water (veggie broth?) and seasoning and you have actually very tasty sauce over pasta.

That’s it from me for now.

If you have any ideas in your comments I would love to see them too because I always need more vegetable on my plate.

I could swap my morning eggs with rice or bread and start eating lunch (something like rice and beans). But I would have to stop eating as much protein sources in my dinners. 

That sounds like a miserable life. Also, it sounds like way more food then I currently eat.

Breakfast: If I'm hungry (most days), I eat eggs and toast. If I have leftover vegetables that I didn't use, I would throw them in there. I always eat something sweet like a fruit or half a muffin.
I almost never eat lunch, but sometimes I snack on leftover food.
Dinner, I try to eat balanced meals. Sometimes, there is no protein source, I would say once a week. As a desert, I always eat a scoop of ice cream or a homemade cake but I don't often eat desert, maybe once or twice a week.

I'm trying to kick my soda addiction to begin a healthier lifestyle. I am very broke, so I know there's a few decent alternatives but they cost like 4 times as much as soda does. Its hard to say exactly what I'm addicted to in soda, but I know a large bit is the sugar (its probably entirely the sugar). So something that's tasty and affordable is what I'm trying to search for. I'm avoiding any artificial sweeteners as well, but caffeine is also preferred (an addiction to tackle another day).   
  
I dislike most seltzers, they feel like someone added a drop of juice into sparkling water, and it feels like the carbonation is a bit much in them, don't quite know how to explain it. But I do know the bubbly isn't a must have for me, I really like juice, gatorade, vitamin water etc so I can see myself switching to something non carbonated.   
  
But without artificial sweeteners, and without going towards seltzers I don't even know where to begin. So any advice from anyone who's got similar tastes and made the same journey, I beg you for what helped you swap. I know there won't ever be a perfect substitute. So I know that it's gonna be tough no matter what I try to substitute with, but hard swapping to water hasn't been so helpful for me. I found a bit of success in diet soda, but I really don't want to have artificial sweeteners either. I've been drinking a lot more water lately, but its hard to keep it to \*just\* water.

Makes 4 servings   
Ingredients

For the Spicy Mayo

* 1/3 cup mayo (or sub Greek yogurt)
* 1 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar
* 1 to 2 tablespoons Chili Garlic Paste (or any spicy sauce)
* 1/2 teaspoon sugar (optional, but nice)
* 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil

For the salmon

* 1 pound salmon, skinless, cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks
* 1 teaspoon mayonnaise (or substitute vegetable oil)
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons honey
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 - 2 teaspoons any spicy chili powder (I used Korean gochugaru)
* 1 teaspoon cornstarch

Make the Spicy Mayo: 

1. In a small bowl, stir together the mayo, vinegar, chili paste, sugar and sesame oil. Set aside.

For the Salmon: 

1. Preheat the air fryer to 375ºF.
2. Dry the salmon well. Add to a medium bowl and toss with (2 teaspoons) mayonnaise (or 1 teaspoon oil), cornstarch, soy sauce, honey, garlic powder and gochugaru.  Make sure each piece is coated in the seasonings. Add the salmon in a single layer and air fry until just cooked through (about 130ºF on an instant read thermometer), about 4 to 6 minutes.
3. To serve: Divide the rice into 4 bowls, top with salmon and add your desired vegetables and garnishes. Drizzle over some of the spicy mayo and serve with lime wedges. ",1749225515.0,83,13,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet

Grab a lil bowl, plate, or serving apparatus of choice. Put a serving or two of this delicious, crisp watermelon on said apparatus. Stick it in the freezer for 30-45 minutes.

My cupboards are stuffed full of shelf stable items I don't get around to eating. I need to cut back financially so I'm wanting to figure out some meals to help me use up what I already have by adding as few/ cheap ingredients to what I have. Sorry in advance this will be a very long list hope this is the right forum! 

TLDR mostly starches not much to go with it

Full set of spices/ oils/ vinegars/ soy sauces/ hot sauce
Various stir fry sauce packets 
Lasagna sheets
Noodles ( udon, instant ramen, vermicili)
Rice paper wrappers for Summer Rolls
Tinned soup, salmon, rhubarb, water chestnuts. 
Rice (basmati and sushi)
Pasta (fusilli)
Bread mix 
Frozen baguettes
Frozen prawns
Frozen peas/ green beans
Frozen parathas
Frozen pasta sauce that's too spicy for me 
Frozen soybeans 
Garlic
Onions


I am not a massive fan of lentils or chickpeas but otherwise very flexible food wise.

Can anyone help me with suggestions of mild, yogurt-like things that are fruity but also low sugar (and not cottage cheese)? Or low-sugar regular yogurts? I like the fruit flavors, and I like the protein... but I don't like overly tangy or ""cheesy"" types of yogurts, so this has been a challenge to find healthy and affordable options. There must be some low-sugar regular yogurt out there somewhere??? Does anyone know of any (USA)? 

Should I just buy plain regular yogurt and stir some jam in?? Is that better?

I’ve had this pulp in the freezer for over two weeks now, and it’s still great, but I’m wondering: **how long can I safely store this homemade mango pulp in the freezer?**

I’m using an airtight container, and my freezer is at 0°F. Since I store it all in one container, I’m worried about freezer burn or quality loss over time. Has anyone stored mango pulp for months or even a year this way? Does the sugar help it last longer? Any tips to keep it fresh and avoid freezer burn when I keep opening the container? Also, how do you know if it’s gone bad? I’d love to hear your experiences and any tricks for making the pulp last longer for my shakes! Thanks!

To that end I devised a plan to portion and ingredient prep for salad bowls that I can mix and match every week, so with a once weekly costco run to restock on the greens, I could have a salad for dinner every night and not run into the problems of missing ingredients or things going bad. By planning in advance how many times a week to feature each ingredient and how many portions to divide each package into, I can then assemble a rotation of recipes that use the appropriate amounts to get me through a week while reducing waste to near zero and using costco sized packages. 

The table of ingredients I went with is short at only 10 lines and chosen by personal preference, but the approach works for all kinds of variations. Here's what I have: 

* **Romaine Lettuce**

  * Cost: $4.99
  * Meals per package: 7
  * Cost per meal: $0.71

* Total Monthly Cost: $102.67

I put together a spreadsheet that helps me balance out nutrition and put together a stack of recipe cards that I can cycle through the stack every week to hit all the consumption targets. Wash and prep everything in advance for the week, then just assemble in a bowl for each meal.

* kcal per salad average: 618
* sugar avg 13g
* sol fiber avg 15g
* total carb avg 36g
* fat avg 38g
* protein avg 34g

EDIT: for those wondering, I carve down the chicken right away and separate it into 3 small containers (I like the stackable rubbermaid ones), put one in the fridge for the first few days, and the other 2 in the freezer to pull out as I use up the stuff in the fridge, so you can really stretch a bird out if you want and not have it go bad.

So I’ve been eating this often lately for nutrition needs and it’s delicious. I’ve been sharing with so many who had great results all around so I thought I’d share my recipe here for all to enjoy. 

You’ll need: 

Frozen strawberries. (I prefer organic, do you) 
Your bread of choice. (I like multigrain/oat, do you)
Feta cheese
Balsamic Glaze
Healthy oil of choice. (I like organic avocado) 


You can use 3-4 strawberries cut thinly however I’ve been obsessed with 5 lately. So you choose 5 frozen strawberries and cut thinly. Thaw them. 

On one side of each piece of bread, brush your oil. 

Slice 1-2oz feta 

Oil side down, place bread in heated pan.

Lay the feta on. Allow it to warm up. 

Arrange the slices of strawberries on top of the feta and then sprinkle with balsamic glaze. 

Top with other bread slice 

Flip sandwich. Both sides should be golden brown.

You can rearrange my way of doing things as well ingredients to suit you. Such as adding spinach and blueberries. Herbs. It’s all up to you. 

Eat and enjoy the mood boost, protein, antioxidants, and have a great life!

1k8otl9,One Pot Ricecooker Khichdi,"This is my take on Khichdi, it's by no means authentic. It's affectionately known in my household as ""Bean Slop"" and has become a favourite even with the picky eaters.

It's a one pot meal, I just use a cheap no-name ricecooker with a single on/off switch.  It's a little small and this recipe fills it to the brim, but still works out ok, a bigger one would work better for this recipe.

I add a small amount of beef mince for flavour and nutritional reasons, but can just as easily be omitted.

Ingredients:
1 medium onion diced
4-5 cloves crushed garlic
1 tsp crushed ginger
125g minced beef (or some sesame/sunflower/pumpkin seeds for methionine)
1 cup green lentils (soak first)
2 cups brown rice
1 400g can black beans (or frozen peas)
1 heaped (tea) tsp garam masala
1/2 tsp tumeric
1/2 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp paprika/chilli (or to taste)
1/2 tsp salt
3.5 cup water/stock
Half a 250g pack frozen spinach

Method:
Rinse then soak lentils in boiling water for half an hour, then drain, discarding soak water.

Sauté onions, garlic and ginger in rice cooker until soft, then add mince and brown. (Make sure you turn the ricecooker back on if it clicks off if it lacks a proper sauté function)

Drain beans, but reserve the bean liquid as part of water/stock.

Add the lentils, beans, rice, spinach and spices into the pot and mix well.

Lastly, add the liquid and let cook until it clicks off, topping up as it cooks if all the liquid doesn't fit.

Notes:
It's fairly easy to adapt to instant pot, 8 minutes at pressure followed 10 minutes natural vent. Water levels can be tricky, it might take a few tries to get it right. 

White rice works too, but works better with and split lentils, and a little less liquid. I tend to soak the yellow ones for 15 minutes first. Red ones don't need soaking. For instant pot 3 minutes at pressure plus 10 vent in the instant pot.

If I had a bigger rice cooker, I'd probably throw the entire pack of spinach in.",1745706081.0,23,2,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet

1k71x3h,Quick chickpea & tomato soup,"Serves four

Prep time: 3 minutes.  Cook time 5 minutes.

 **Ingredients:**

·             2 tbsp olive oil

·             Sprig of fresh rosemary – about 6 inches

·             1-2 cloves garlic, sliced

·             1 large can tomatoes

·             1 large can chickpeas

·             1 litre chicken stock

**Method:**

1.          Strip rosemary leaves from stalk & chop coarsely.

2.          Slice garlic.

3.          Chop the tomatoes (I use the lid from the can -- slide it vertically into the can a few times, turning after each slide.  Does a good job.  No mess).

4.          Mash the beans a bit (to your preference).

5.          Heat oil in a 4-litre soup pot on medium heat.

6.          As soon as the oil is hot, toss in the rosemary & garlic.  Stir briskly for a minute.

7.          Once garlic is starting to brown, toss in the tomatoes & stir (Maillard reaction is your friend!).

8.          Toss in the mashed chickpeas.

9.          Pour in the chicken stock.

10.       Bring to a boil.

11.       Add salt & pepper to taste.  Serve.

 

If you don’t have chickpeas, white navy beans would work. ",1745524997.0,28,1,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet
1k6pyz2,Alternative to biscuits/cookies,"I'm in the UK, I drink a lot of tea. One of my pleasures is dunking a few chocolate bourbons or chocolate-covered digestives in my tea. 

Problem is, lack of willpower and portion control. The number of cups of tea I drink means having 3 or 4 biscuits per cup is a whole pack gone in a day. I have also been known to just sit and eat a whole pack in one sitting - more regularly than I should! 

I've tried limiting to only after work or only at the weekends but I just binge in my self-imposed allowed times instead. I eat fairly well other than this, I've tried various substitute sweet things (fruit, nuts, yogurt, small ice creams) and they're fine for satisfying the sweet craving after dinner but not the ritual of dunking in tea.

1k2p00m,How do I turn the pan grease from baked chicken thighs into a sauce (or other recommended uses),"I frequently bake bone-in skin-on chicken thighs because they're fairly cheap and it's easy to throw some seasoning on them and toss them into the oven. I need to learn some patience--if I cooked them low and slow, they'd be more tender. It's often something I make when I don't feel like spending time in the kitchen.

Being super fatty, they always leave behind a ton of grease and fat. At least a half cup if not more. I bake them in a baking tray, lined with aluminum foil and then parchment on top. So nothing is sticking or baking on, there's nothing to deglaze. 

I'd like to learn how to make a light sauce with the leftovers to put on top of the chicken and keep it moist. I'm sure we all are familiar with how chicken likes to dry out in the microwave. I'm not sure how to go about this though. Some of the drippings are more oily, some parts are a bit more solid. Do I have to separate the bits? What do I add?

I'm also interested in learning how to get the skin to crisp up better. Even at 450 F it's flaccid by the end. Or is it more worthwhile to save the skin for making stock?

1k1lr6b,Mexican Rice w/ pico de gallo and cottage cheese,"What is this witchcraft concoction??

I discovered this from Frugal Southern Momma's YouTube channel. I was so doubtful. I've never like pico do gallo, I'm meh on cottage cheese. The reactions they had when they tasted it convinced me to give it a try. I didn't expect much, but I enjoy experimenting. 

I loved it. I've now eaten it for lunch multiple days. My husband takes it for lunch. I make it once a week and my kids eat it happily. Therefore, I have to share the recipe. You can also watch Frugal Southern Momma make it in her Mexican Struggle Meals video. Homemade Pico de Gallo is key!

Start: Wash your rice!

**Mexican Rice**

·         2 tbs oil

·         2 cups washed rice

·         ¼ red onion

·         1 clove garlic

1.      Toast above ingredients in a pan for 10 minutes until golden brown (if using brown rice which I really liked, I just toasted until I thought 10 minutes had passed and some rice was charred)

·         5 cups water

·         2 tbs tomato chicken bullion (typically found in the international or Mexican aisle of your grocery store)

2.      Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until absorbed (20 minutes for white rice, 40 for brown)

**Pico de gallo (as my wife liked to tell me, this means beak of rooster so it has to be small pieces, I don't mind larger chunks, but kids prefer smaller)**

·         4 romas, finely diced

·         ¼ red onion, finely diced

·         Juice of 2-3 limes

·         Juice of 1 lemon

·         1 serrano, finely diced

·         ½ cup cilantro, chopped (can omit if can't handle cilantro)

Serve with cottage cheese (I use small curd) and tortilla chips. Can eat as a dip or crush up and put in rice. I just mix it all up and serve with a side of pinto beans if I feel the need for more protein and fiber. This is so cheap, so easy to make, and so delicious.

1k0xivg,Need help managing my eating habits – looking for advice or shared experiences,"

Hi all – I’m a 25-year-old male, 175cm, 80kg, and probably around 25–30% body fat. I’d like to lose a bit of fat (maybe 2–4kg), but more importantly, I want to improve my relationship with food.

I’ve lost weight in the past (a few years ago), but now I find myself in a really difficult place mentally when it comes to eating. I’m constantly thinking about what, when, and how much I eat. It feels obsessive – and honestly, exhausting.

**Activity-wise**, I exercise frequently. I cycle 10–15km a day to commute, and I either go for a run (5–10km) or do strength training at the gym (upper or lower body) pretty much every day. So I’m active, and I’m generally conscious of my nutrition.

I’ve tracked macros before and I’m aware of the importance of protein. I do best when I track, but I’m trying to get more protein from natural sources like meat, poultry, and dairy instead of powders. That said, I struggle to hit targets unless I *do* track.

I’m writing this post out of frustration after what happened today. Here’s what my food looked like:

* **Breakfast**: Protein porridge with blueberries + a bit of peanut butter, coffee
* **Lunch**: 2 chicken thighs, roast veg, ½ a medium flatbread, apple
* **Snacks throughout the day**:
   * A slice of raisin malt loaf
   * KitKat
   * Carrot sticks + 1 falafel
   * Small hot chocolate (semi-skimmed milk)
   * ½ a salted caramel hot cross bun before my run

I then did a **9k run** after work at a moderate pace/effort. After the run:

* 2 eggs + roasted veg + mushrooms in the leftover flatbread
* Skyr yoghurt with protein powder, blueberries, and some peanut butter

And *then* I kind of spiraled. I had what I’d call a mini snack-fest – random stuff like raw vegetables (I often eat raw carrots and broccoli because they feel ""guilt-free""), some nuts, small bits of cheese. I didn’t track it all, and I felt out of control, angry, and disappointed in myself.

This happens a lot – especially **after dinner** or **after exercise**. I feel like I lose all sense of portion control. I keep snacking in the hopes that something will “hit the spot.” I drink a lot of peppermint tea too, so much that it sometimes wakes me up in the night.

I’m reaching out because I need help. I feel like food has become my only reward system, and I’m worried that I’m developing or already have some kind of disordered eating. I’m constantly hungry or thinking about food, and it’s making life harder than it needs to be.

Has anyone been through something similar?  
How did you manage to:

1. Stop erratic snacking and post-exercise binges?
2. Rebuild a more intuitive, healthy relationship with food?
3. Stop thinking about food 24/7?

Any insights, resources, personal experiences or kind words would really be appreciated.

I’m in a dilemma. My bf’s brother and cousin moved in with us, and I’m struggling with dinner ideas. The brother and I both need to focus on losing weight (for medical concerns/issues), and the cousin straight up refuses to eat vegetables. Like 100% won’t do it, he’ll eat marinara sauce on like pizza, or sloppy joes, but will either pick out veggies or just make something else if it’s too difficult to pick out. He’s contributing to the house hold (them moving in is mutually beneficial for them and us) and paying his share of groceries, so I don’t want to tell him “sorry, you just have to buy and make your own food” when I’m cooking for everyone else in the house, but I feel I like I’m going to pull my hair out trying to think of meal ideas.

1jws11v,Branch Out From the Same 2 Lunches,"So, since I started working and living on my own, most of what I've been bringing for my lunch has either been a sandwich with one of three fillings (pb&j, turkey slices, or roast beef slices and a slice of cheese) or some homemade pasta that I make. There are fast food places in the surrounding area, but I don't really like to eat out hardly at all, since it can get expensive.

I do drink water too, but it’s not exactly comforting. 

Tea used to be my cozy moment, kind of like how some people enjoy small treats during the day. But now I’m trying to cut back to a maximum of two cups a day (plus I drink matcha latte before heading to work).

Mapo tofu with a little bit of ground beef, green onions, two packages of silken tofu, a boxed mapo tofu sauce mix that I get when it's on sale, and a scoop of chili crisp because the sauce isn't spicy enough.

Veggies in the picture are gai lan (Chinese mustard greens) sauteed with garlic, ginger, and a brown sauce made from a little bit of sugar, dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, and water.

Our kids eat dinner at my parents' house occasionally and then my husband and I get to feast. I make this combination about once a month. It's cheap, easy, and healthy but could probably be slightly cheaper and healthier if I made my own mapo tofu sauce. I have a very busy job though so I'm okay with taking shortcuts.

1jux9bm,Gardening for cheap veggies,"I wanted to share some gardening tips I have learned over the years, in case they help you grow some cheap veggies yourself.

Potatoes: If you have potatoes that went ""bad"" and sprouted, just plant them. With proper care, they will make a large harvest with minimal work. This is essentially ""free"" food. Potatoes can be grown in containers as well, though the harvest is smaller.

Green onions: We have not had to buy green onions for a few years now because I planted the cut ends with roots in our garden and they have multiplied. They can be propagated in water super easily, just stick them in a jar.

Other plants that are easy to grow:

Peppermint: Grows like a weed and can be used to flavor desserts and brew herbal tea. 

Collard greens: Grow really well in many climates. They are one of my favorite vegetables and are resistant to pests that go after lettuce and spinach.

You can go to a seed exchange, if you live near one, and pick up a huge quantity of seeds. Ask around for the easiest plants to grow in your area!",1744172282.0,134,20,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet

Now, because it seems the cost of literally everything is going up, I'm getting back into the meal planning thing again, at least for dinner. I'm also trying to learn to make things from home so we don't have to spend $$ on things that *aren't quite right*, but that is slow going. My latest accomplishment is chorizo, Mexican style, not Spanish.

I searched this sub-reddit for websites but all the other posts seem to be no newer than a year old. I frequent Budget Bytes and A Pinch of Yum, and I get emails from Cookbook Publishers 2x a week with free cookbooks. I have the Kindle app and score cookbooks for free from there at least 2-3 x a month. It's not cheap, but ideally, I'd like to only have to shop 2x a month, once for meat, missing ingredients, and all the miscellaneous essentials. The second shop would be for missing ingredients and essentials.

SO is adamant there's an animal based protein with dinner and prefers beef, but he'll *suffer* through chicken/pork. He doesn't eat leftovers, and tires of the same type of meal quickly. Like no Asian food 2-3 x in a row kind of thing, even if it's different dishes. I'm trying to incorporate shrimp/fish, but I'm limited to frozen fish fillets because I never paid attention to Mom when she was cleaning fish so many years ago. 

I'm looking for websites that have fairly inexpensive ""main course"" recipes that can handle protein substitutions (chicken/pork/beef) or recipes that use frozen fish fillets without being mushy and gross. Yes, I loved fish sticks as a child, and no, I wouldn't buy/eat them now 🤣. I can cook/bake/grill practically anything except fresh fish. I've tried, and it mediocre at best.

1juhu8w,Buy untrimmed meat and use the trimmings as your cooking fat.,"This is just a little tip for those trying to lower their food expenses. Instead of buying fully trimmed beef, pork, and chicken cuts, buy the cuts that still have the fat and even the skin left on. Then trim off those parts yourself and render the fat/skin into the pan you’re using to cook the meat. Cooking meat in its own fat both amps up the flavor and saves you money. If there is excess, render it all and save the extra fat for later. Obviously meat itself can be a bit of a luxury depending on your budget, but this little tip will help you save on buying cooking oils and save on the meat itself.

1jp8e2r,How to save my bland buckwheat? 😭,"Made some buckwheat with mushrooms, and added roast chicken and chicken juices to it 😋 so far, so good! 

Sadly though, I overcooked the buckwheat a bit and it’s quite bland. Any advice on how to jazz it up a bit please? Do you think a garlicky yogurty sauce would be a nice addition to make it a bit more flavourful? Or do you have any other suggestions? Thanks!",1743545404.0,9,20,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet

1jmy5g9,PSA: Savings & Sustainability,"I don’t know if I can post a pic, but while grocery shopping today I checked the “past peak” produce section. The store bundles up a few items together and sells them for cheap to move faster. 

Today I got 5 bags for a total of $5:
$1 for 3 avocados x 2
$1 for 2 orange and 1 green bell pepper x 2
$1 for 3 cucumbers

All of these were still fresh and tasty, no mushy spots or mold, but just a little past prime. 

- The 2 avocados I opened were perfectly ripe with no brown spots! The remaining avocados will be guacamole for a get-together tomorrow. 

- The bell peppers were only slightly wrinkled and will be chopped and used in breakfast scrambles the rest of the week. Any left over in Friday get put on a homemade pizza, in a chili, or frozen. 

- The cucumbers looked good, just some light dimpling. They have been cut into sticks and rounds to snack on and add into smoothies for the next few days.

In the past I’ve gotten bags of exotic fruit  like dragonfruit, star fruit, and lychee; as well as jalapeños and serranos. I try to check periodically, and if I find anything good, immediately prep and make a plan for them once home. Most are fated for the freezer or “add-in” recipes (smoothies, fruit salad, soups, stir-frys, curry, chili, egg bake).

So, friendly reminder to check out those sections of your local market! You’ll be saving money, maybe picking up something new, and helping reduce food waste while eating cheap and healthy!

Anyone else do this and score something cool?",1743287752.0,52,12,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet

1jm5vf8,Broccoli Cheddar Rice Krispies,Looking to develop a Broccoli Cheddar Rice Krispie recipe to get more protein and fiber in when I’m craving something sweet. Let me know what you guys think. I’d cut the broccoli up really fine and then bake it on a tray until it’s dried. Make the Rice Krispies like usual but use beef tallow instead of butter and sugar free marshmallows. I’m keeping the marshmallows in the recipe because I think it will be like a salty sweet factor. Add Tilamook cheddar cheese (my favorite) puffed rice and the dried broccoli.

1jkqulz,Not-too-filling carb/fat sources?,"I'm 24M, 110lbs. I average 2500kcal a day to maintain my weight, since I bike a lot.

I generally stick to fruits, nuts, and vegetables. But since logging my food a month ago, I've noticed that my daily protein intake is 130g+.

Generally the staple foods that I eat daily are:

- 100g (dry weight) black beans (for carbs, fiber, and protein)

- 2 eggs (for protein, and because I like eggs)

- 1 can sardines (for the omega-3)

- 2 oz almonds (for calories + vitamin E)

- 4 oz (dry weight) pasta (for calories)

- 30g chia seeds (for fiber)

- 1 cup skim milk (to wash down chia seeds)

- about 200g combined of carrots, broccoli, and kiwi/citrus fruits (for Vitamin A/C/K)

- whatever else to bring my calories up, usually a scoop of peanut butter or pancakes with fruit jelly.


TLDR I'm trying to eat less protein, if doing so would mean I get to add a greater variety of healthy foods to my (admittedly) homogeneous diet. Maybe different fruits or nuts?

Like, it almost feels ""wasteful"" to eat more protein than I need, if that makes sense, since I know there are probably other things with miscellaneous nutrients (antioxidants, phytonutrients, etc.) that I could be eating instead.

My vitamins and minerals (according to cronometer and my own spreadsheets) all meet the recommended amounts. I keep sodium around 1000-1500mg/day and saturated fat under 30g, all of which come from dairy. My fiber is about 45g and I don't think I need more than that. I'm happy eating bland/tasteless foods, since I don't use salt and sugar in my cooking anyway.

Lots of the classic carb-heavy foods like rice and bread are just too filling for me. Even my daily bowl of pasta is more filling than I like. If I eat a bowl of rice, it honestly feels like I don't have enough room left in my stomach for the rest of the day. The ""perfect"" food for me right now would be something high in calories via carbs/fat, and not too filling, but I'm not sure how many of these foods exist.",1743034019.0,13,40,EatCheapAndHealthy,diet

I’d prefer a way more subtle taste if possible, if you could recommend types instead of brands that’d work better since I may not be able to find them here. I do enjoy those vanilla yogurts where you mix it with some chocolate balls they give you because the taste also seems a bit milder? Also a bit unsure what to add in it, I’m really not a fan of nuts, dried fruit and all of that healthy stuff, they just taste awful. Maybe add some biscuits, but is that healthy? I know I’m really picky. As for fruit I also don’t enjoy most of them because most are (slightly) sour which is just sad. Also doesn’t necessarily need to be cheap. Thank you!
