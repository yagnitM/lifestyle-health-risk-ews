1qancan,This fucking sucks. 71 Days sober.,"Pretty much the title. 71 days sober. And I’m miserable. 

I had been drinking 2–3 drinks a night (sometimes more) an average of 4-6 days a week for the last 20 years. I knew that quitting would be hard emotionally and socially but believed the positive effects on my physical health would outweigh the negative. Instead…

- I’m in terrible physical pain. It turns out the drinking was keeping me physically numb not just emotionally. Now I’m acutely aware of the pain caused by spinal issues, with no relief. 
- I’ve gained weight. No logical explanation given that I just cut out alcohol calories. I’m not tracking but my diet has not changed significantly. 
- I look worse overall. My face suddenly looks like a deflated balloon, and jowls are far more prominent. Guessing I had a mild bloat going on before that kept my face looking propped up. I also look MORE pallor. 
- Energy levels have not noticably improved. If they have it’s been so neglible it has not made a difference in my day to day life  

Maybe its because I’m neurodivergent or maybe because I’m naive, but i heard all these people online and in real life say they quit drinking and now they have more energy and they feel better and they lost weight and blah blah and yeah, i guess I thought that would be true for me too :( .

1qan2bj,You Don’t Need to Beat Alcohol. You Never Will.,"Alcohol is bigger than you.

Much bigger.

Entire economies were built on it. Empires taxed it. Corporations perfected it. Governments depended on it. This drug has changed the course of history.

You are not going to “defeat” something like that.

But here’s the thing:

You still get to choose what you do today.

No person, no substance, no company, no state gets to control your actions unless you hand that power over.

So today, you have one job:

Don’t use. That’s it.

You don’t need to win some lifelong battle.

You don’t need to convince your brain.

You don’t need to silence the thoughts.

You won’t.

Your brain has been shaped by alcohol, and it will talk:

“You’re not the same without it.”

“You’re less productive without it.”

“You’re depressed without it.”

“Life was better before.”

“Just stay on a controlled regimen.”

Lies. All of them.

But they don’t come from nowhere. They come from a substance so powerful it rewired societies, not just individuals.

So stop trying to outthink it.

Stop trying to beat it.

Stop trying to prove anything.

You don’t need to defeat alcohol.

You just need to not use today.

1qaly5q,"The Daily Check-In for Monday, January 12th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!","*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning (or evening, depending on what time zone you are in).

Another Monday has arrived and luckily I'll wake up sober to take on the day.

I was a daily drinker…. scratch that, a minute-by-minute drinker… So, that usually meant I was waking up late on a Monday, with a headache and regrets from the night before. Skipping breakfast, racing out the door with a quick shot to ""pick me up"" and get me to work.  

Today, I am grateful that I can show up on time to where I need to be and get what I need to get done.

Speaking of showing up, one of the most important gifts I've received from sobriety is the ability to show up not just for myself, but for others.

When I was drinking, I made empty promises, no-showed work meetings, and hurt those around me personally and professionally. I was simply untrustworthy. People stopped asking for my help. And worse, people stopped believing in my words.

Today, I can stick to the things I say I am going to do in all aspects of my life. I also have the courage to apologize and give a courtesy notice in advance for when plans derail. But now, when I do, people believe it because I show up 98% of the time. 

That all said, my two questions to you all tonight are: 

Have you noticed an increase in your ability to show up since quitting drinking? 

Furthermore, what is one thing or person you were able to show up for last week that you normally wouldn't have been able to when you were drinking?

Have a great Monday, everyone!

1qaky2h,Advocate/life coach,"Hello, I have a friend whose brother is in a situation with no clue how to help. My Friends brother has been in the hospital for the past seven months in between ER hospital stays and rehabilitation hospital stays. Although sober know, a lot of health problems were brought about because of alcoholism.  He is in liver bad decline and was getting healthy enough to receive a transplant but once he’s healthy enough to start at rehabilitation hospital, he began to get sick again and go back to the regular hospital. He’s never able to obtain good health long enough to receive a transplant at this point. now he has been discharged from the occupational hospital with only a few days notice even though they said they will give him six weeks notice, but did not, and he’s discharged from the regular hospital starting tomorrow without no where to go.  my friend‘s brother lives in New York City and my friend lives in Indiana.

My question is:  is there some type of advocacy program/life coach options available for either pay to hire or for free that could be of support to my friend’s brother. They have little family left so my friend’s brother has very little support, but insist he stays in New York City.

So my friend‘s brother is needing some support when it comes to health needs mental health needs, getting back on his feet needs, and returning back to regular life. Is there any programs or people that offer these types of support? my friend‘s brother has enough money to at least get by for a couple months, and get a place if his own but not long term. Only until to get back on his feet so getting a job immediately isn’t a huge priority, but will need to be in the next couple months. He desperately needs some support in all these aspects, but not sure where to look for them or if there is even such a thing.",1768191014.0,1,2,stopdrinking,substance
1qakw8l,About to go on a work trip. Give me tips to stay sober!,"Hi all! I stopped drinking on Jan 1, after 20-odd years of daily drunkenness (ranging from blackout to barely making it to bed). I've been doing pretty well so far, with the help of my very supportive partner.

  
But I'm scared. In two weeks I'm jumping on a plane to Asia for a work trip, which is essentially a big junket disguised as a ""leadership summit"". Think listening to presentations and strategy sessions by day, fancy dinners and lots of drinking at night.

Now, obviously most other people there (as far as I know) don't have any kind of problem with alcohol, so they'll potentially be using it as a bit of an excuse to knock back a few extra  drinks and get a bit pissy while on a work holiday, and I'm concerned about 2 things;

1) not revealing to everyone that I'm in the very early stages of recovery, and;

2) not giving in because I'm away from my normal support network and routine.

Begingiing with pre pre gaming then to another bar to pregame and then to a sit down dinner at a really nice restaraunt with some awards,,, then more bars! I have always been a huge part of shutting down the town on this night with the guys!

Anny hewser... this night was different. I have not drank since may 16th,2025 and I decided I wasnt going to drink that day either. I HAD A BLAST!!! i partied with the best of em and watched as they all started peetering out! lol    But to the strong gooers i said, ""its your world im just in it ... LETS go!"" so needless to say we had blast and I drove everyone home safe in a boat of an expedition max, (not mine\_ ) but daaaang that is nice ride!

I didnt desire I didnt want or yearn. I drank what I wanted and it was non alcholic. BY CHOICE! who woulda thunk it? a guy like me having a blast and not drinking?

I have reached a plateau *(i first wrote ""PEAKED"" but I went back and changed it cus I dont think I am at the PEAK! )* defintely looking for what more rewards arise from this life changing experience and I wanted to share that it is possible to not drink and be happy.

I grew up with my mom living with pretty intense alcoholism, and I've never even been close to her worst (nor any of the people I met when we she brought me to AA with her as a kid). 

But that being said, I've had a lot of mental heath problems, and binge drinking has always made them much worse. I've done things I regret, especially with and to women, when I was really drunk that are really problematic and gross. But I wasn't an alcoholic. This would happen like once a year. But brevity of harm doesn't mean that it wasn't harming me.

On my birthday last summer I decided to go cold turkey. It's been almost 200 days, and its been a big benefit to my health and wellbeing. Instead of a few nights per year feeling like shit and making a fool of myself, I have zero. My anxiety is lower, my GI is WAY better, and I've saved some money. 

Anyway, for anyone who thinks that sobriety is ONLY for daily drinkers who are at rock bottom, take a minute to really consider this. Alcohol is a very powerful substance, one that has profound effects even occasionally. If you think it is a net positive in your life, that's fine.

On New Year’s, my boyfriend of 8 months invited me to his family’s New Year’s party. I’ve recently been struggling with alcohol and made the decision to avoid situations with heavy drinking while I try to get myself under control. I told him ahead of time that I wanted to stay in because I didn’t trust myself around that environment.

The next day, he ended the relationship. He said we didn’t share the same values — that holidays are very important to him and that I should have been able to control my drinking. The truth is, right now, I can’t reliably do that, which is why I made the choice I did.

I’m devastated. I loved him deeply and keep thinking that if I had just gone, maybe things would be different. But I also know that protecting my sobriety felt necessary in that moment.

I guess I’m posting because I feel a lot of grief and guilt, and I’m trying to remind myself that choosing my health wasn’t the wrong decision — even if it cost me someone I loved. If anyone has been through something similar or has perspective, I’d really appreciate it.

1qah18c,I can do hard things,"Tomorrow is my new year :)

January 12th I declare as my “New Year” in the sense that I pick something to celebrate in a year after doing or not doing said thing for 1 whole year. That something up to the challenge is THC, my favorite pastime…

I challenged myself to 1 year No Alcohol. 1 year felt scary enough, and anything longer felt too scary. That 1 year anniversary came and went in October 2025. So… 450 days ago. Sometimes I wish I could drink again, but I proved to myself in the past, every single time, that I’ll never have a normal relationship with alcohol. So when that desire comes, I just as easily let it go. It’s a great feeling to acknowledge that yeah, it’d be fun to be drunk right now, but to also be so glad you aren’t. 

I want to get to that point with weed. I’ve always gone back to smoking, no matter how long the breaks inbetween have been. 

I feel like we’re all soothing our way thru life with our adult pacifiers because life sucks. And we feel the weight of all of that when we were never supposed to. So I get it. But I feel like a zombie just getting by, unable to enjoy anything because I’m trying to desperately distract and numb myself from the reality.

Ideally, I wouldn’t rely on any substances (except caffeine 😅) to make me feel good. 

50 days ago I gave up my vape. So I know I’m capable of quitting, the idea is just so daunting and it’s hard to fool myself into thinking as small as “it’s just for today” when I know my intention is quitting long term. ",1768180221.0,8,2,stopdrinking,substance

It felt like I saw none of the benefits people talk about. I kept going because even if I see no major benefits, at least I’m not experiencing the ongoing negatives from drinking.

I’ve been sticking to a daily checklist/routine for two whole weeks now that I would normally lose interest in after a few days. My focus is improving. The bloating and inflammation is going down. Not huge changes, but noticeable to me. The motivation to continue is coming from a place of self respect and a tiny twinkling of self love even. As well as trust in the process.

In a way, I’m grateful that it hasn’t been smooth sailing and instant benefits, as the knowledge and feeling that my body is still healing and repairing is motivating me to continue. I did not set out this time to quit forever, I thought I’d take a break to let my body heal a bit, lose a bit of weight and get better focus at work. Weight loss has absolutely not happened at this point. But my focus has started to improve. And as I’ve come to this community for inspiration, solidarity and advice, I’ve become more and more motivated to continue for much longer, maybe forever, to see it through and enjoy the various changes at whatever pace they happen for me. I feel my body is healthier and it feels like respect.

I found it difficult to find posts that don’t boast a whole heap of instant benefits within the first few weeks, so for anyone who needs it now I want to remind you that everyone is different and the improvements can really take time. A friend of mine complains that every time she takes a break from drinking her face looks awful and her sleep is terrible and she throws the towel in after a couple of weeks because there’s no point doing it. If you’re reading this and quitting has made you feel and look worse so far, please keep going, don’t let it dishearten you. Your body needs time. It does start to feel so lovely to treat your body with more kindness.

I feel like this needs editing but my eyes are half closed at this point as day 31 comes to an end. IWNDWYT",1768179927.0,9,5,stopdrinking,substance

1qaffo7,Day 11,"Been lurking for awhile.  I saw a post recently where OP discusses a quote from Steve-O, something along the lines of how alcohol doesn't necessarily destroy you all at once, but can have the effect of limiting your potential.

My weapon of choice has changed over the years.  Liquor turned into beer which turned into wine.  I can down a bottle of wine quickly, no problem, and want more.  I don't even get hungover.  I'd hide bottles from people who would come over knowing they would disapprove.  On days off, I'd start early.  Why not?  I had nothing better to do.

Maybe that's the problem - I thought I had nothing better to do.  I work two jobs, somewhat successfully getting through a master's program, maintaining a relationship.  It's okay, but I am often unhappy.  I tend to reflect negatively on my life as a lot has gone wrong.  I feel as though I have been treated unfairly and have ended up where I am because of it, and I know I tried to do the right things and was rewarded for it.  I also often look towards the future expecting the steps I take to try to better my life to fall apart as they so often do.

I have learned that trusting others to do the right thing is foolish.  I have learned that people will always choose what benefits them over you.  I have learned that fairness is a myth.  And I have learned that drinking because you're sad keeps you sad.

All of this to say that despite whatever BS happens in your life, alcohol is poor self-medication.  It's an easy band-aid that pushes sadness to tomorrow.  It may very well be the one thing limiting your potential - the potential to look at things differently, experience the day through clearer and less tired eyes, have more positive conversations with yourself and others.

It's day 11.  I am still sad.  I still think about the people who have hurt me and continue to do so.  I still linger in memory of hurt from those I choose to keep in my life and those I pushed away.  I feel as though these thoughts come on more than usual because I'm not in a drunken haze - and I find myself wanting to grab a bottle of red on the way home from work as I had done so many, many times before.

Sorry for the vent.  I won't drink today, I hope you don't either.",1768176112.0,15,4,stopdrinking,substance
1qafcpz,One thing I do while drinking is play multiplayer video games. I feel like I can’t connect as well with others while sober.,"I’m sure this is a tale as old as time. But nowadays, I’m struggling with drinking regularly.

I used to drink out at bars and felt like I made friends. Sometimes I said something dumb and was ashamed. Bad cycle.

As I’ve gotten a bit older a lot of my social interactions are on multiplayer games.

The issue that I’m coming across is that it’s the same thing as socializing in real life to a degree. When I’m drinking, I can be way more talkative and funny. Sure there are times that I probably get too drunk and end up playing badly, and talk too much.

But just last night, I hit the right level of buzzed, and I made my party laugh for pretty much the whole night. Uninhibited. I even screen capped some of the moments to make sure they weren’t laughing at me being a drunk jackass. I was just cracking jokes and it seemed normal.

The very next day, I played with some of the same people. I went back to being my reserved self (sober) - it bummed me out. I feel like the riffing and connection were there when I was drinking. During sober play I felt self conscious and put my walls up.

This is one of the things I’ve struggled with my whole life, being an introvert with some social anxiety. Drinking has always brought out another layer of me that lets me let loose. But it is terrible for me of course.

I’ve had moments where I decide not to drink, then socialize. 70% of the time I’m fairly on edge. 30% of the time it’s fine, I’m me, but I’m more of a reserved me, but I’m comfortable,

I’ve always had that anxiety, and it’s one of the key reasons I keep drinking. I hate it though, but it numbs all of the worry. Anyone have a similar experience ",1768175920.0,6,5,stopdrinking,substance

I Google dived and wish I hadn't because I had another one after that... The first one was at work, had to go sit down which hasn't happened in ages.

I've not drank because I know drinking will make it worse so I've stuck to it but my head just won't shut up telling me that every pain I get in my head is something extremely bad that will land me in hospital or I'll d13 from it before I can get there.

1qacjem,My sister (34) passed on New Year's Day after sudden liver failure.,"My wonderful sister Jackie has passed away at the age of 34. I am her younger brother (27) and I've always looked up to her, despite us having a rocky relationship growing up. As adults, she became my best friend. She never got a good chance in life. She was born with fetal alcohol effects and had bi-polar disorder. But there was one thing that got her the most--Drinking.

She didn't drink at all until she was 18. But then, she started drinking vodka basically every day. Unfortunately, alcohol can be a tough mark on life being indigenous. Our mom is a day school survivor and has been drinking basically all of my life. However, she only drinks beer, which doesn't help the whole trauma of growing up around alcoholism but oh well. I'd ask my sister why she wouldn't just drink beer, to which she replied that it tasted too bad and she couldn't chase it. Fair enough.

Her drinking reached a head when she was in her mid-twenties. I can't recall the details, for reasons you'll read in a minute, but basically her body's nerves shut down and she was briefly paralyzed. She had to learn to walk again and go through months of therapy. You'd think that would be the final message to stop drinking, but no.

In 2016, our father went missing. Turns out he was secretly dealing hard drugs for gangs, and a few weeks after my 18th, he was never heard from again--presumed murdered. I believe this sent my sister off the edge mentally, as the two shared a very close relationship in those final years. She drank more and more, it was difficult to live with her at times as her and her boyfriend would fight at night, which sucked for me as I'd heard enough of that growing up with our parents.

In 2018, I was diagnosed with epilepsy and began having daily seizures. Being in a smaller city, there were no neurological treatment options here. So, my sister made the decision to send me a few provinces over to our grandmother to get the proper medical attention needed. I was angry at her when I first heard it as I did not want to leave, but she reassured me that I would go there and get the help I need and come back. So I left. This was the best decision of my life. I went through 4 hard years of painful seizures and then recovery, then the acceptance that \~80% of my memories from my pre-epileptic life gone, the rest were a weird scramble. But she was there. She would tell me stories about our childhood and our family. We would have long calls laughing and then we would watch movies and tv shows together.

The last few years have been very tough for her. The drinking and reckless actions were very distressing. It was very difficult to hear her tell me about getting assaulted at a random party and seemingly never learning from these incidents. Hearing my drunk mom complaining about her while they were screaming around, or vice versa. But, it was also so nice to call and hear you both laughing and having a great time together, acting more like sisters than mother-daughter at times.

But I knew I was so close to getting you and mom out of there. Just a few months away from becoming a power engineer, with the money to get you all the resources possible to get you sober. To gift you with the nicest phones and computers and keep you feeling confident like I have been with gadgets this year.

I should have brought you out here, but... I just didn't want to risk you getting mixed with the wrong crowd here like many of our cousins on the reserve. I wanted to wait until I could fund a place for you, get you on your feet. I feel like was so close, man.

I remember the last time we talked--December 14. I had just finished practice test #50 for the day, studying for the provincial exam. I was emotionally and mentally exhausted. I wanted to scream into a pillow. I then heard a song that triggered the passing of our Great Aunt Christine back in February. I decided to call you randomly. You answered and asked how I was doing. I said okay and you saw right through that. You let me vent out all the pain, let me cry and just be weak for one moment. You gave me such strong words. I told you about how excited I was for the future. I told you how I was going to get you so many dope things. You laughed and told me to treat myself first, and then you told me you loved me and I said love you too and that was it.

A few days later, on the 18th. You go to the town's hospital with stomach pain and they ship you to the city for further testing. They bring in a team of specialists from Vancouver, who tell us that you have cirrhosis of the liver, with a prognosis of 2-3 years. The following day, they give us an update--not only are you ineligible for a transplant, your prognosis is now 1-3 days.

Talking to mom the entire time was extremely difficult, hearing her make noises of pain I'd never heard before, having this odd realization that you and her sound a lot alike when crying heavily, etc.

And then, a few hours past midnight on January 2, you passed away in your sleep.

This has been so sudden, I don't even know what to say. I feel like I haven't fully processed it and I can't even relax much due to how demanding school is. But I will keep going because you'd want me to, bro. I wish I saw you these last 6 years. But... I know I will see you again. I love you so much.

Please, if you are drinking--get help. You don't have to go cold turkey, but please, don't give the ones you love the pain I feel. These last few days, I've been staying off social media as I keep instinctively saving memes to send to her, before remembering... My sister was my best friend. This void without her is something I can't even begin to quantify. The feeling of thinking about how she's gone is similar to the one you get when watching a gore video--just disgust, disgust at life. Don't leave your family with this feeling.

When I think of you, Jackie. I'm not going to think of this forever. I'll think of the great times, the fun memories, and the great sister. I love you homie g <3

1qacjb1,Dry Januaryists- Day 11 book recommendations,"When I was first navigating my way through early sobriety, I leaned heavily on books. I needed new perspectives and new ""voices"" in my head to replace the old ones that were telling me to drink.

Here are the books that helped me change my thinking.

Sober-Specific Reads:

• Sober on a Drunk Planet (Sean Alexander): A great, modern look at the reality of our drinking culture.

• The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober (Catherine Gray): This was a game-changer for me.

• Sunshine Warm Sober (Catherine Gray): Her follow-up, which I found just as helpful for the long-term view.

Books that helped my mindset:

• The Midnight Library (Matt Haig): While not about drinking specifically, I found this fascinating when thinking about ""playing the tape to the end"" and the different lives we could lead.

Stoicism:

About four months into my journey, I discovered Stoicism. It helped me channel the calmness I had caught glimpses of in sobriety. 

While I eventually moved on to the core original texts (especially Epictetus), I found Ryan Holiday’s books were the perfect ""easy entry"" into these ideas. They are short, well-written, and practical:

• The Obstacle is the Way

• Ego is the Enemy

• Stillness is the Key

• Discipline is Destiny

I also really appreciated How to be a Stoic by Massimo Pigliucci (which explores the teachings of Epictetus).

I’ve found that my sobriety is about more than just ""not drinking""; it’s about building a philosophy for life that makes drinking unnecessary. These books were the foundation of that for me.

Would be keen for any recommendations- especially works of fiction that have resonated with people on their journey.

1qaceng,I’m having a really hard month.,"I decided to do dry January before the new year started because it felt like I was just going way overboard since October through the holidays. But of course, life has chosen to make this month where a bunch of shit happens. For reasons I won’t get into my NYE countdown unfortunately did not go as planned and left me feeling alone. And then during a day I didn’t have work for the holidays, and had nothing else to do, I randomly decided to drive 5 minutes from home to get Starbucks and got into a wreck. I acknowledge it way my fault, though I genuinely didn’t see the other driver and made an honest mistake. To add the cherry on top insurance has now decided that my car is a total loss.

He confided in me that he went out after work last night and tied a hard one on. To the point of being still pretty wasted at that point in the morning, and how after he was done today he was planning on going right back to it to watch the game this afternoon. I had zero desire to drink, but I was immediately struck by the desire to just go be a part of the party. I didn’t. I finished, clocked out and went home. I guess my gripe is that I’m still learning how to say no to myself, for now, and just feel like I’m missing out on the fun. It’ll pass, I’m sure, and after awhile I’m hoping I can join in the revelry without being overwhelmingly tempted to pick up a drink. It is what it is, I suppose.

1qac2dk,6 months sober; None of my (24F) friends want to hang out anymore,"I don't really know what to do or who to talk to about this. I have (had) a lot of friends, and of course a lot of what we would do was drink together-- I would only consider one or two of these friends as ""drinking buddies"" and most I have known 10+ years. I went sober in July 2025.

Now, to be clear, I honestly don't talk about my sobriety, I just order N/A beers. I am a very boisterous party person both sober and drunk, and I invite my friends to do the same things we'd always do but most of them haven't replied back to me in months, even when I try to make plans 5+ times. Most recently, my best friend (25F) of 15 years flaked on my birthday in October after not seeing her since the end of July (we used to hang out 1-3 times a week when I was drinking). Since then, I literally get a text back from her one out of every 10 attempts. This is similar to a lot of my friends, but a lot of them I have just mentally let go of because I didn't want to bother anyone. But others, I see them hanging out with other people, some new people, on social media, particularly snapchat in real time. Almost 100% of the time, they're drinking, so that may be part of why they don't want to associate with me anymore but I don't know. I don't get it. 

I don't really know what to do, and I feel so alone in this. When I was drinking I was so popular but now that I drink NAs or THC drinks it's like no one wants to be around me... does anyone have any advice?",1768167907.0,9,11,stopdrinking,substance
1qabnb2,Feel like I've made progress but I've been made to feel the Villain.,"I'm really sorry if this is not the place to post this but it is highly alcohol related and relates to my ultimate goal of having healthier drinking habbits, if not stopping altogether.  
  
I am 100% transparent and happy to answer any questions people may ask for context. I appreciate there are heavy marriage elements but I feel they tie in to my desire to drink. I know it's very long but I felt context mattered to better explain how I got here and why I feel the way I do.  
  
**About me**  
I've drank since I was 14, I'm Male, 35 and I'm told by others around me including my Wife that I have strong Autistic traits, although I've never thought of myself that way. I only mention this because I believe there is supposed to be a connection between Austism and drinking or so I'm told.

I am quite an outgoing person, I actively arrange and lead varies activities, sober whilst arranging it and during the events. I never need a drink to engage in conversation and rarely feel discomfort in social situation with people.

**My Drinking**  
I don't think I'm an Alcoholic but I do know for that I have a drinking problem. I steer clear of rums/whisky and beers with a high % (like 6% + ales) even when offered to me. If on the rare occasion I do drink a Whisky it will be a single glass accompanied by no further Alcohol within a 24 hour window. These rare occasions being a big celebration with a Cigar or to Toast the dead.

When I do want to have a drink, I will often over indulge. Most commonly I will drink Stella cans at 440ml. I wouldn't personally say I drink alone as I'm always on a voice call (Discord) speaking to my real life friends that I went to Highschool with who live too far away to come over. My wife feels that this is me drinking alone which I can fully understand.  

I will start drinking between 15:00 and 19:00 and usually drink 8 of the cans totalling up to 16 units a night, something I know is bad for me and is a problem. When I was in my early 20s it wasn't uncommon for me to do this every weekend. Since being married I cut down to once or twice a month and even more recently once a month under strict rules that I made for myself which I will go into later.   
  
My Wife has told me she has a problem with my drinking and it relates entirely to health, I pressed her on this to see if there is anything else but she has assured me it's all health related. When I drink I'm not abusive towards her or ignore her, often choosing to want to spend time with her Platonically, drinking doesn't make me sexually active so I don't pester her for sex or make a move on her whilst drunk. I don't miss deadlines or opportunities to go out or avoid going out  as a result of drinking. It's quite common that I actually clean the toilets, wash the pots, hoover up and put the clothes in the washer. I've always done this even prior to being in relationship.  
  
Drinking often motivates me to do things I've been putting off, this is what makes it hard for me stop drinking altogether because I become a more proactive person when I drink. I delve into similar scenarios below but you can imagine how messed up my head gets being (and I hate to use this word but it the best way to describe it) ""moaned at"" whilst I've got my head deep under the rim of the toilet scrubbing away. I understand what she is unhappy with but you'd usually associate being moaned at with like....sitting on the couch all day watching TV or generally being lazy.

  
**The Rules**  
As my wife was concerned about my drinking I decided, unprompted, to address her concern and look for a solution. That solution came in the form of ""House"" rules and we worked on them together. I initially made rules for myself

* No more drinking once home for a day/night out
* No drinking on my own
* No pre-buying alcohol unless I give it to my wife to Police (this is for something like a new years party so I don't have beer in the fridge that I can drink whenever)
* All rules apply regardless of my Wife being home or not

But added rules for her to as I've asked her to support me on many occasions and as I'll explain in detail later, she has failed to do so.

* My wife can't complain about my having a drink if I follow all the rules 
* Do no belittle or ridicule the small wins

  
**The Current Problem**  
This weekend the rules were broken, but not by me. I announced that I was 10 days sober to which my wife said ""That's something I do all the time"" and other variants of congratulations and jazz hands. The jazz hands may or may not have happened but the sentiment is the same, I was being clowned on for being happy at 10 days sober. My instant thought was....what is the point, I'm doing this for us and she seemingly doesn't care. Alas I powered through.   
  
We went out for a meal and I had 2 Pints of 3.8% beer with a large meal, everyone else had mocktails/non alcoholic. We went to the shop and I bought an Alcohol Free Mix Pack from Brewdog. Granted it is technically 0.5% but I would have happily settled for Heineken Alcohol free (With them, being 0.03%) were they on offer.  My Wife then asks why I'm continuing to drink. Now I can understand her position her but I explained to her that her normal concern about health issues caused by alcohol are not present in the same way and I'm enjoying my weekend. After we got home I drank 6 of the 8 330ML cans and left the last 2 because I didn't feel like drinking them.   
  
We went home and we were playing some games together. During this I was getting my Alcohol free beers out to drink. Throughout each drink there was some remark said that made me feeling that I was a villain for drinking Alcohol free, so much so that I thought I might as well have been drinking Stella. I even considered going out and buying some because at least then the lashings I was getting would make sense. I personally felt that I made some progress and explained this to her but it was not taken as such. 

**The Last Straw**  
Today I went out with My Wife, Sister in Law and Father in Law. We were eating some food and my wife asked what I wanted to drink, I said a pint of Stella which denied because no one else was drinking. Her input was that the ""House"" rules were not for the house but for everywhere. This isn't what I agreed to especially since as I'm the one who instigated making and designed the rules in the first place. She said if it was just for the house then I've I can just go to the pub and drink alone. I explained to her that I'm not going to nor have I ever gone to the pub whilst being with her and being single by myself to drink and our local is 5 minutes on foot. The rules have been in place for months I was under the impression they were ""House"" rules. 

**How I Feel**  
I've explained my feelings to my Wife. I know I've made leaps and bounds since 6 years ago and every day I feel like I'm making progress but I'm being treated as if it means nothing. As if every step I take towards perhaps being sober completely one day is ""What normal people do"" Despite her saying  ""You're an alcoholic"" Like if she truly believed that then every day sober is a win surely?. Like every time I make progress the goalpost just keep moving.  I feel like I'm not in control of how I want to get to my goal. I feel like the rules I set for myself are being hijacked and I can't even have a single beer with a meal in public, in place where 1 meter away 4 lads are having a pint.  I know that drinking nothing is the best solution but as I described before I feel better for drinking. 

I even looked up my local AA with the consideration to start going. Regretfully I told my wife I did this and it's recently been used a crux against me suggesting how bad my drinking must be as I considered going.

I just don't know what to do I'm thinking ""F$%£ it, if I'm constantly made out to be a villain for something I've not even done then why I don't I just do it and at least I'll be able to..."" for use of a better phrase ""reap the rewards""

I feel like I'm being controlled and if I just divorce my Wife I can go back to my life being normal. I obviously don't want to, I love her and I married her because I love her, the only issue we have realistically is my drinking.

Has anyone else faced something similar in my situation? I feel so trapped.",1768166930.0,2,3,stopdrinking,substance
1qab6q3,10 days sober,"The difference 10 days has made in the way I feel has made me very excited for this year. My last drink was on New Year’s Day and I’ve been sober since. My plan was to go at least 100 days however how good I’m already feeling has already got me questioning why I would go back and drink again. What’s the point in having a buzz from a drink for a few hours for it to then impact all the important areas of my life. 

I’m surprised at how good I feel already, my sleep has been better, my anxiety has decreased, my productivity in work has increased, I feel as if I’m returning to my normal, motivated happy self which is a massive relief because towards the end of the year I was mentally at a low place after drinking too much at a works Christmas party.

1qab4aq,5 years Sober Breakdown,"I was a binge drinker for over 20 years and quit over 5 years ago. 

In the beginning 5 years ago I had the shakes from not drinking. I used to dream of drinking. I could visualize a glass of wine or whiskey and seriously taste it in my mouth by memory. It was hard as hell as I quit cold turkey without help. I would not recommend this. 

After that first couple of months, every day has been easier than the last to not drink. Then over the holidays we received a gift of alcohol from family because they don’t know I’m sober. That bottle has sat in my kitchen for weeks. I didn’t think it would be a big deal. My wife still drinks occasionally and so we kept it. But time as gone on, I keep looking at this bottle. Every day I look at it and think about it. It’s been 5 years and I still get this feeling? 

It broke me. I had to tell my wife to throw it away because I felt so much shame that I couldn’t stand looking at it. I broke down crying telling her about this. Thankfully she is an amazing person and validated my feelings. She didn’t make me feel like a loser for feeling this way. It’s unreal to me still that this triggered me so much. 

Either way, I did not drink and I’m thankful for that. Every part of my life is better off without it.

Funny, I don’t feel this feeling when I buy alcohol, because I’ve chalked that up to a survival strategy (I’m not saying this is logical lol.) 

I’ve taken the money that I’d usually spend on booze, and have bought some new clothes and a personal training session.

1qa7ry9,Seeking advice: Letting go of the need for the “buzz”,"👋🏽 Hello to this awesome community—first time poster here.

A little backstory: I’m a high-functioning 39F. Almost four months ago, I completely quit a decade-long dependence on tramadol (an opioid painkiller with SNRI effects). It was originally prescribed for legitimate medical issues, and I was told it wasn’t addictive—which, of course, wasn’t true. Over time, it became a daily habit.

When my relationship was on the line, I flushed the medication and cut ties with the prescribing doctor. It was one of the hardest—and proudest—things I’ve ever done.

After that, I replaced it with another pain medication that had a mildly sedative effect. I’ve since kicked that habit too, and now only take it when I’m truly in physical pain. I meet weekly with my therapist, which has been a huge source of accountability and support.

Here’s where I’m struggling now: I notice myself filling the desire for a “buzz” with what was left for me to reach for—alcohol. A few drinks at a social event or with dinner. It seems harmless in the moment—but I almost always wake up feeling awful the next day, something many of you have described here.

I just finished This Naked Mind by Annie Grace. It was excellent. Intellectually, Dry January made sense to me—but emotionally, I wasn’t there.

So my question is this: How do you deal with the desire for that feeling of being buzzed—especially when you justify it as a reward for working hard and always being “on”? Sometimes I just want to be “off”, and the alcohol “helps” with that.

Other lifestyle factors—I workout regularly (former athlete), meditate 2x daily, have a loving partner, nice friends, meaningful work, non alcohol related health issues that I pour energy into healing…and yet still reaching for the poison. My newest poison. 

Any insight or lived experience would really mean a lot. Thank you for listening!",1768158054.0,5,2,stopdrinking,substance
1qa7q0q,I just want to stop,"I (31f) am without a doubt an alcoholic. I try very hard to deny it, justifying and rationalizing my drinking with myself, but the truth is, I haven’t gone a day without drinking in years. I want to stop. I wake up each morning with the motivation to stop, but by the time late afternoon rolls around I’ve given up and caved in. It’s gotten much worse in the last few months. For context, I come from a small family of just me, my parents, and my brother. My brother and parents went no contact in September, and I’ve felt caught in the middle and incredibly stressed over it. So I drink to escape that stress. I’m also potentially on the verge of being laid off or having my hours drastically cut. So I drink to the point of blacking out and embarrass myself greatly along the way. I’ll send texts that I immensely regret the next morning and try to explain away my behavior in an attempt to cover up my drinking. I don’t think I’m covering it up well, but no one has called me out on it and everyone just ends up forgiving me, because despite my disgusting drunk side, I do think people generally enjoy being around me when I’m sober.

1qa7iuh,I relapsed after 12 days sober,"I’m really sad writing this, but I need to be honest: I relapsed after 12 days sober.

I didn’t even go buy alcohol. I was looking for something in my closet and found an old bottle I forgot about. My brain started bargaining immediately (“it’s already here,” “just one,” “I can handle it”) and I drank.

I started IOP this week so I feel extra ashamed. Like I should know better. And it’s not just the relapse, my boyfriend said I was yelling and acting differently, and hearing that makes me feel sick to my stomach. I hate that alcohol turns me into someone I don’t recognize and that the people I love have to deal with it.

Right now I’m trying not to let shame turn into a spiral. I’m resetting today. I’m getting rid of anything alcohol-related in my space because clearly “I forgot it was there” is a relapse trigger for me.

If you’ve been here, what helped you most in the first 24–72 hours after a relapse? How do you repair things with people you love without drowning in guilt? I really want to get back on track and not let this turn into a binge.

1. I finally talked to my doctor about my anxiety and depression this summer. Once my medication kicked in, things seemed less gray and hopeless. Gradually, a sober life seemed like something worth pursuing. 

2. My husband started ozempic for his type 1 diabetes and lost all interest in alcohol (lucky). All of a sudden I was the last person at the party, which felt embarrassing. Drinking alone forced me to examine my dependence on alcohol.

3. I turned 43 in December and the voice that says I am running out of time is getting louder. I have two kids in middle school. Man, once they are out of elementary school time seems to speed up exponentially. I dont want to lose any more time being numb or too hungover to enjoy this.

We took a big trip to Italy as a family over the holidays. And I drank too much on the trip home. And then continued the drinking at home. Missed an entire week of work (blamed the flu). I am, again, 1 day sober.

1qa5t2e,I'm ready.,"27M and have been drinking since I was 14. 

It started out as the perfect solution to confidence and social anxiety. I felt like a 'cooler' person, someone with so much confidence and courage, I felt like I could comversate with anyone. 

It began with drinking on the weekends at parties.
I remember during that time that I began to count down the days at high school until the weekend. 
I couldn't wait to go partying and it was the only thing I was interested in.

My parents didn't know for maybe the first year or so but then when they were aware I started to ask them to buy it for me and they did. At the time they were both in a very rocky marriage and today I feel like I preyed on that weakness to benifit myself. 

They would buy me smokes and cases of beer. 

I dropped out of high school after they split up, I was friends with older student in high school so by the time I was a senior they had all left and I had no one and I was struggling with the divorce of my parents, so I want to pretty much self medicate with no thought to the long term detrimental effects like poor health, poor quality of life and addiction! I just knew that alcohol and weed would make me happy. 

During this time I lost friends because of my reclusivness and alcoholic outbursts. Trauma began to surface and it was bleeding out on to people that I loved. 

I have lost my parents, brother, sister, best friends, girlfriends everyone. 
I been to prison for assault and now am on a community order with a criminal record. 
I've embarrassed the ever living hell out of myself with people I know, family and or strangers. 
It's destroyed my mental health and has stopped me from getting help and fixing my life.

I'm turning 28 this year and just about half of my life has been spent drinking. 
I now pretty much wait to get paid so that I can get drunk and escape. 
For a long while now though it's as if I've had two sides to me 

The alcoholic side that doesn't care about anything or anyone just as long as there's booze and cigarettes. 

And the logical more true to myself side that wants out of this vicious cycle so badly.

And they fight each other every minute of every day. 

This morning I woke to my step dad yelling at me for things I had done the night before. 
It was extremely close to getting physical and he even had the police dialed ready to call and with the situation I'm in at the moment it'll be straight back to prison if he had made that phone call. 

I got verbally lashed all day until my mum, step dad, sister and boyfriend went out on something they had planned a while ago. It's just been such a rough few years, it's gotten so much worse and will continue to do so. There's no rock bottom, it'll going for ever. 
Today I just feel like I have no one left, my family are done and my friends are gone. 
I have one first though that I just met via a dating app and she's extremely understanding even after the fact that over the past few days my toxic alcoholic side bled out on to her for no reason. 

The longest I ever went without drinking was 6 months. 
I want to try again and I'm confident that this will be it. 

I plan to get an education via university, work a job and save, exercise and eat healthy with a strict routine and finally getting long term help for my addiction and mental illness.

Alcohol is so fucking destructive, it's so normalised. 

I'm done though, I deserve better than this.

1qa5g85,"DAMNIT I fell again, but I'm choosing to get back up!","So, I had a solid 7-day run without any beers, and I was feeling really good about it. I was even in this subreddit, encouraging others along the way. Then this past Friday, I fell flat on my face.

What caught me off guard was that the urge hadn’t really been there earlier in the week, not on Wednesday, not even the day before. But something about Friday night pizza with my family did it. I’ve always paired pizza with a cold beer, and on the drive home, I was hungry, tired, and the urge hit hard. It was an old pattern coming back with a vengeance, and it wanted what it wanted… and unfortunately, I gave in.

The next morning (Saturday), I woke up feeling like crap, went out to work my side hustle, didn’t make the money I expected, and frustration set in and hunger set in and that familiar thought crept in: *“Well, might as well have a cold one and relax at home.”* And I gave in again.

So here I am now, sitting at my computer doing some research on how our brain works and addictions, trying to understand why I keep falling in this same area. What I’m realizing is that this isn’t a willpower issue as much as it is a wiring issue. My brain has been trained over the years to reach for alcohol as comfort, relief, and reward. Our brains get a rush of dopamine just at the *thought* of a drink, and that excitement can overpower the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for logic, self-control, and sticking to our own rules.

So I have some rewiring to do! 🧠

This is a battle I’m not giving up on.

I will become a man who doesn’t desire alcohol when stressed or seeking comfort. I will be sober for my family and my kids. I will rewire my brain, and with God’s help, I will continue to pursue sobriety, especially on the weekends when it can be the hardest.

To everyone I encouraged this past week, I want to be honest and say I *felt* like a hypocrite coming back on here, but I know I’m not. Because I meant every word I shared with you this past week. Falling doesn’t erase sincerity or progress.

I’ll be back here this week, checking in again and encouraging others as we walk through this together. This is a new week. A fresh start.

We can make money, pride ourselves on our accomplishments, plan for the future, regret the past, etc. But you are going to die. There is no other certainty that matters today. Each second, minute, hour, and day belongs to Death. The Stoics turned this into a positive idea, creating a sense of urgency with what matters most in your life. The idea is termed “Memento Mori” or “Remember Death.” Use this mantra as you do the work you know you’re supposed to do. When you feel like sitting on the couch naked, eating bonbons, remember that you are giving that time to Death, too.

**Reflections**

How much time have you already given to Death? All the years of drinking, using, debauchery, and shenanigans. Are you living each day with the knowledge and understanding that you are dying? What did you leave on the plate today that you should have done?

**Daily Challenge**

Been lingering on saying sorry to someone? Still, have some amends you know you should be making? How long has it been? Don’t let the time run out. Please write it down, find that person, and tell them how you really feel. Remember Death.

I sat in the hospital in 2020 with a collapsed lung and lung disease. My lung would not adhere to my chest cavity after surgery and it looked a lot like the end to me. But I did it with humor and grace. I loved that about myself. I read a lot of Stoicism during that time. Understood the concept of ""Memento Mori"" and as I have been receiving bladder cancer treatments recently, I am reminded yet again that I must do what I can now. As difficult as it is to find a bathroom every 15mins, I need to try and do the things I was put here to do.

1qa28yy,Finally made the choice to put down the bottle!,"This is my first post here, I’m new so bear with me. So for context, I am 26 years old and I’m a rather tall, lean body type. I’ve struggled  with alcohol since I was 19. I used it as a coping mechanism for depression, anxiety, and just to feel something good at the time as I was going through relationship problems and was surrounded by the wrong people. My vice was hard liquor, specifically 99 brand liqueur. I drank anywhere from 1-2 fifths a day for about 2 years from 2019-2021. Around 2023, I slowed down to about 16 shots a day. In 2025 I managed to keep it on average from 4-12 shots a day depending on my mood. But I could never quit. Fast forward to New Years Eve 2025, just 11 days ago. I made the choice to quit drinking. However I made the mistake of quitting cold turkey. By the end of the night, around 7 pm I started having a seizure was rushed to the ER. I was in the hospital for 4 days. My heart rate was through the roof and my BP was 150/146. My electrolytes were basically gone. I had carpopedal spasms in my hands and fingers. I struggled to breathe. It was a life changing experience for me. Ive never been able to put alcohol down, not even for a day. I’m now 11 days sober and I’m fighting through cravings and mood swings. However I feel like a new man both mentally and physically. I apologize for the wall of text, I just wanted to share. YOU CAN QUIT!",1768145569.0,1,0,stopdrinking,substance

I was at a big event (with my husband, who is a musician), only knew one person outside of the band, super awkward and also super loooong- started at 9 and ended at 3 am. Normally I would either drink to put a bubble around the awkwardness, but this time all I could do was watch other people doing that and feel so glad that it wasn't me! As the night went on I kept thinking how many drinks I would have had by then, and how sloppy I would be getting after six hours of free alcohol. The organizer even sought me out multiple times to offer me a glass of wine or a gin and tonic, but I sincerely did not want them. I mean, I have been in plenty of those situations and not drunk, but usually I would have to conquer the craving in some way, but this time the craving was just... not there. New experience for me. I am not getting complacent, but I just needed to share with people who get it. IWNDWYT.",1768142438.0,73,6,stopdrinking,substance
1qa0p1b,Day 6…yesterday,I messed up. I got off work and went to the liquor store and got a drink. I’m not hungover I don’t feel bad. I didn’t over do it. I just wanted to drink. No other excuses.

1qa0gz6,60 days on my 52 bday,"Yesterday was my birthday and also marked 60 days no alcohol. It’s also the first time I talked to my husband about my not drinking. I was afraid it was too fragile to bring it up before, and that my brain might sabotage me or something. 

Talking to him about it actually helped it gel for me. 

My issue with alcohol wasn’t that drank often, but when I did, there was a better than 90% chance of overdoing it. A hangover was a guarantee, and it was a dice roll of whether I’d also embarrass myself (like suggesting a sex party at a work happy hour…), fight with my partner, make myself sick/trigger a migraine. 

So I decided to just examine my relationship with alcohol without judgment. When the urge to drink popped up, I stopped to asked myself what I was really looking for- a reward, a ritual, a fast forward button to unwind. And really consider whether alcohol was bringing this to the table. 

Yes, it could serve all these purposes, but at a cost, and was the cost worth it. 

So far, I’ve decided it hasn’t been. And every single time I’ve decided to not drink has been a way better experience than any time I had decided to drink. By leagues. The decision itself feels amazing. And the tea, or NA mulled wine, or hot chocolate has done more than enough. I mean shoutout to tea for doing a lot of quiet work. I’ve had such low expectations of tea as a sub for booze, but it feels better than alcohol every time. 

I’ve also decided that I trust my future self to make that decision for me in the moment. I can’t and won’t commit to never drinking again. I tried and it makes me angry and feel rebellious. But I can commit to making a conscious informed decision. So let’s see how this goes. :)

1q9zylq,7 days no alcohol,"I wanted to briefly share my journey and what is helping me now.  Family history of alcoholism, grew up with both parents being alcoholic.  I promised myself that I wouldn’t do that to my children.  Flash forward, I did become dependent upon alcohol.  I quit 11 years ago, was sober for 4 of those years.  Fell off the wagon, had short intervals of sobriety.  Got sober again 3 years ago.  Then this past year fell off again, stress of life ramped up.  I was quick to stop this time and have been sober for a week.  I went to AA the 1st time around and had a fabulous sponsor but really hated AA’s philosophy so I haven’t gone back.  Recovery is often not linear at least for me it’s not.  I have had to find my own path by failing and learning how great it is to be free from alcohol vs. the short term pleasure of drinking.  
Using some things that worked for me in AA like the acronym H.A.L.T. (Am I hungry, angry,lonely,tired) when I have a craving helps. Listening to books on getting sober like Quit like a Woman, This naked mind, drinking a love story motivates me.  Also learning about the science behind addiction to alcohol has been helpful for me.  I am currently reading Alcohol Explained.  Through Reddit, I have this community now. In a post someone shared the app. Reframe, I am finding it very helpful!

1q9zkiv,63 days,"I have been making a weekly post to document and reflect on my progress, and here I am at week nine. Here are a few things I've noticed this week, from a former near-daily chronic binge drinker:

The cravings have taken on a different shape. What once felt like a compulsion to drink is now a thought that says, ""It would be really easy to walk to the corner store and buy beer/wine right now"". Those thoughts have still been popping up for me almost daily, but I no longer feel the invisible pull to act on them. It's liberating.

My feelings are more transitory. Previously my binge drinking had created an effect where small problems became very big because I turned them into reasons to drink, which just escalated things. This past week especially I've been able to take note of how I'm feeling, positive or negative, and be confident that I probably won't feel the same way in a matter of hours or days. So there's less reason to drink about it.

Bullshit radar is more sensitive. Other people have been noticeably more draining to me. I'm a lot more attuned to things like passive aggression or insincerity. This is coming from someone who tries to see the best in people and tries to examine their own actions when it comes to interpersonal stuff. But now I see I wasn't always being fair to myself and had been internalizing things that others had done, because I was already consumed with guilt over my drinking habit.

Overall there has been a lot of solitude for me lately. I am lucky though to have one sober connection in my offline life, someone who is a lot further along in their journey than me. I'd be nowhere without my art, journaling, and aimless walks in my city. I am also grateful for this community for your kind and supportive words. Hearing your stories has been motivating and reassuring. There was time not long ago when 63 days was unfathomable to me. IWNDWYT.",1768138747.0,17,2,stopdrinking,substance

1q9ywzp,6 days sober after 14 months of drinking - My story and i need advices,"Hi all.

I'm a M35 (almost 36) north italian male.

I always was a ''party drinker'' since i was 15 but nothing continuous and serious, and my family is from the Eastern Ligurian Riviera (the village is famous internationally and one of the top toutistic destination in Italy and Europe) where wine is, since roman times, a big economic and social factor. But i don't live there anymore cause mass tourism destroyed/is destroying these places and the town is unlivable.

Since late october 2024, when i broke up cohabitation and relationship with my ex gf and since i was literally fired from work cause they had to hire the daughter of a big boss (yes, in Italy these things are still common in the XXI century), i ended drinking every evening before dinner a liter (i think in america it's the equivalent of  33,8 Oz according to Google but i'm not sure) of a strong Polish (sometimes a Russian one) strong  8,5 - 9% beers.

In the weekends in increased to 3, or sometimes 2 + a glass of peated strong scotch (Talisker, Laphroaig and Caol Ila were my favourites)

I took a sh\*tload of supplements during these months: high doses NAC, high doses Milk Thistle, 500mg thiamine, methyl-b12 and active folate and zinc and magnesium citrate. Sometimes, cycled, r-ALA, a multivit 2-3x and probiotics.

I'm also taking 1mg of Prosom (estazolam) since April 2025 due to insomnia and YES, i drank not with the benzo itself but while on benzo.

Since a week, i decided to stop. Both alcohol and smoking.

Tomorrow will be my first full week sober and, for quoting Jordan Belfort in ''The wolf of wall street'' ... ''It sucks being sober''. Days are boring and long, time expandes.

Please give me some advice how to stay sober. I'm in contact with my psych but i need ''third part'' advices and recomendations too.

I don't have physical cravings but the idea of sipping a slavic beer or a glass of the local wines of my relatives in Liguria appeal me a lot.

Am i permanently fucked?

Can i be happy or even normal again without drinks?

(also please don't tell me to quit also the benzo: i know it's shit, but quitting alcohol and smoking at the same time is enough, for now)

1q9ylum,What was your 'hangxiety' like?,"I think a lot of people drinking heavily believe they suffer from anxiety but don't relate it to their drinking. In fact, they begin to believe they drink because it helps their underlying anxiety, rather than realising that alcohol actually fuels it.

Obviously some people do have existing, underlying anxiety, but in my experience this is different to 'hangxiety'. What become difficult when actively drinking is the ability to separate those things. It only really becomes clear in sobriety.

So what did YOUR hangxiety feel like? How was it different?

For me, there was a very physical aspect to it. The general feeling of being unwell/hungover, that feeling like your nervous system is shaking internally, being too hot or too cold, feeling nauseous. These are symptoms of anxiety, but physically caused by a hangover/excessive drinking. I think my brain would then sort of search for worries to explain this anxiety, almost trying to justify it, rather than facing the fact that quitting alcohol was what was required, because obviously at that point I was very resistant to the idea that alcohol was a problem.

What I ended up in was a torturous cycle of relying on the thing that was fuelling this cycle to give me just a couple of hours a day respite from it. Until, eventually, even that didn't work. It just became a constant, varying in degrees of severity, but always around.

What was it like for you?

I am nooooot a person who can deal well internally with meeting and hosting new people, on the outside I seem incredibly chill but internally I'm freaking out. I tend to let my mind race and think about things like ""what if they hate me and never want our kids around each other again?"" Etc. Etc. Normally Alcohol would help me numb those thoughts.

We rented out a little inflatables area at a local place thats basically a huge warehouse with all kinds of activities like go karts, arcade, zip line, and a bar... 

I stayed strong and despite my nerves of meeting so many new people and hosting about 40 people altogether, I was completely sober. We even went out to dinner afterwards with our close friends, sat at the literal bar of the restaurant, I had bottles and bottles of booze laid in front of me and I ordered my first mocktail. The bartender even said "" just so you know that is a mocktail, is that okay?"" I confidently said ""yes, thank you!"".

I love beer and wine and whiskey for their tastes alone like other foods, i love comparing and testing different brews and brands, and i don't particularly enjoy drinks for getting drunk.

My problem is that i have sensitive kidneys and other genetic issues that cause me pain and honestly not much enjoyment when i drink.

Mostly joint pain like knees and elbows, stomach ache and bad bowel movements, in more severe case i get really bad pain in my kidneys, when i was 18 i drank too much one time and it reached a point where i collapsed and had a hard time breathing from how painful my kidneys were, almost like i got stabbed in my back. Although i never threw up, never passed out and never lost memory or behaved outside my own chocies and peraonality due to drinking.
 So tomato tomato i guess.

I wish i could enjoy drinks more with my friends but the suffering - enjoyment ratio simply isn't worth it so i often decline when they offer and even had bad arguments with my ex who was an alcoholic (maybe still is idk) and often got mad at me for not wanting to drink with her, when i did drink with her it made her very happy while completely ignoring my pain.

Hopefully this post will cause more good and critical thinking rather than resentment because this is something that have been on my mind but no one really to share with.

1q9xid7,I messed up again at the worst possible time..,"Yesterday I came to terms with the fact that I have a pretty wicked sinus infection. I mostly couldn’t hear out of the only ear that has any hearing left, my nose was stuffed and constantly running while also being so swollen that blowing my nose barely helped… it hurt to breathe, my face and throat and everything was so puffy that all I could do was cry. Most of yesterday I laid in bed with ice packs pressed against my face in an effort to relieve some of the widespread swelling.. and god I was miserable.

Around 7pm one of my neighbors (P) reached out and asked how I was. I was honest and I told her that I couldn’t afford mucinex but wish that I could, and she said she’d help in a bit. I took a small nap, and at some point later that evening I woke up to see that she let herself into my apartment (I forgot to lock the door and she’s done this before. She’s somewhat a friend, it just took me by surprise.) 

She brought whiskey, lemons, honey and some kind of tea

I told her I really didn’t think drinking would help, but she gently shushed me and guided me into my bathroom where she turned the shower on as hot as it would go. She then steamed up the room for me and told me to relax before she rushed out of the room. 

I was foggy headed and was struggling to string two thoughts together, and the steam allowed me to finally blow my nose. I sat in there long enough that I forgot she had come over.. and after some time I honestly started to feel better. 

Soon after my neighbor came and got me, guided me to my bed, and helped me dress in pajamas. It felt really sweet of her and honestly I appreciated what she did for me a lot..

Well, I appreciated it at the time, anyway. 

She handed me a cup of what she called “healing tea” and she had made herself a glass also. She made me promise to chug it because it would make me feel better despite it not tasting very good, and she chugged hers with me.. I was genuinely so sick I didn’t even realize I drank alcohol until I felt an all too familiar burn in my chest. 

I didn’t even taste it as it went down my throat.. that’s how sick I am. 

Before she left P made me some soup, and she tucked me in, and truly she was lovely but… she also knows that I’m trying to recover from alcohol. I can’t help but feel like she has to know that this wasn’t the right time to surprise me with alcohol, but she called the drink she made me a “Hot Toddy”? and said that drinking something to heal doesn’t count as relapsing 

All I know is I’m confused, and stressed out.. but I’m at least happy that I slept a few hours after she left and I woke up sober. 

I’m upset that my recovery journey is starting over once again and I really feel like she purposefully hindered my healing process.. and I wish she didn’t.

Sorry for this random rant I just,. I can’t shake the feeling that a good friend and neighbor did something really sketchy and hurtful last night and I’m still trying to process why any of that had to happen :(

In other words, there’s the anxiety itself, what we stress over, That we label as wrong to have and that it needs to go away (with alcohol).Then there is our worry about its very presence, how we need to use alcohol to manage it, and that we have problems and are doing things wrong.

I feel like I'm totally out of alcohol. I have zero desire to drink it, having it in the house doesn't bother me. When I want to have a feel for a friends' cocktail, I just take a single little sip and it doesn't trigger me at all and I can instantly taste the booze.

I decided to host a cocktail party for NYE where every guest had to make a cocktail for a another guest and present it in a cool way. It meant buying quite a lot of booze and having tons of it at home. Seeing the alcohol cabinet full of all kinds of bottles didn't do anything to me. The other occupants of the house will drink it over time. 

Back then I would have said ""sweet, more booze for the after party with myself"" and wreaked havoc on the cabinet the 3 next weekends. 

I tried NA rum and NA martini and not once I was like ""I wish it was the real thing"" 

But the best thing of it all: My buddies didn't get hammered as well and my journey even inspired some of them.

1q9vj5x,Envy,"Hi lovely people, 

I have been sober since NYD (11 days and counting) and I have been loving it! I haven’t had any major cravings or set backs just yet. 

Although yesterday my husband wanted to have a few drinks around our pool with his mate as it was a beautiful hot summers day. 

I instantly had a feeling of jealousy and slight frustration. 

He is so supportive of my journey, he has no problem with alcohol and barely ever drinks. 

I will never ask him to make changes just because of my journey. He deserves to do what he likes and this was a random day for him. 

My question is, how do you move past the feeling of jealousy and resentment of others drinking around you? 

I want to just be able to be around everyone and not let there drinking effect me. 

I’m unsure if this makes sense. 

I feel this is my biggest hurdle at the moment as I am F 30years old and I am the only one in my friends group/family that is implementing this sober lifestyle!

1q9u7iu,I have no choice now,"Hi, long time lurker to this sub. I’ve been a grey area drinker for about 5 years now when I went through a really bad break up… and then 3 months later my ex died. Then , I got married. Then , in record time I had a miscarriage, he cheated on me, and I got divorced. In that 5 years I have had weeks and months where I have been sober. But lately, over the past year and a half or so I’m probably the worst I’ve been in my whole life. I was using booze as a crutch, drinking 5 days a week. 

Well, i found out 2 days ago I’m pregnant. I’ve been dating someone for 6 months, and I honestly have no idea how it happened because I’m in my late 30s now and attributed my messed up menstrual cycles that I’d been having to drinking … I have 2 other kids and I didn’t drink while I was pregnant with them, but I also didn’t have this problem quite this badly when I was pregnant with them. I do feel like I’ll be ok with this pregnancy. I haven’t drank since I found out and the smell of booze makes me nauseous. I am stressed about this unplanned pregnancy, which is obviously a trigger to make me want to drink , but I have no real desire. Just …. None.

If there is a higher power , I’m starting to believe that this was part of the plan to get me to stop drinking. I was in a place where a dui or worse was probably very close …. Until this happened. I just wanted to get my story out there and vent. IWNDWYT",1768120272.0,3,5,stopdrinking,substance

I work a very demanding and physical job, I get a lot of exercise, I eat well, I make sure I get minimum 8 hours sleep, but I cannot seem to shake the severe chronic fatigue. 

I was diagnosed with ADHD around Christmas time and I have learnt that addiction and ADHD often go hand in hand. I have also learnt that ADHD can cause pretty serious fatigue, so it’s like a double whammy! I am unable to get medication for my ADHD due to the massive waiting list and so I am pretty much raw dogging life, playing it on “hard mode”. The exhaustion is ruining me, I am generally worried that I am going to end up having to quit my job because I can’t keep up anymore. I can’t see my friends because I’m too tired, and I spent most of my life recently either working or recovering from work. It’s honestly hell and I’m at my wits end. 

I am resolute and happy with my decision to stop drinking, I know there’s no other choice and my life, in some ways, has gotten fuller. But I’m also really not coping. 

I thought I’d post here and see if there are others like me, and if so, what the hell did you do?! Life is unmanageable and my depression is leaking back in, dripping down into my consciousness and creating a dark pool of hopelessness and isolation.

- saved £100 in a week that would usually go on beer and cigs
- spent that money on exhibition tickets for me and the kids at the Science museum 
- spent the rest at IKEA on a plant and some storage
- way more productive at work
- eating good home cooked food and looking for more recipes
- had way more fun with my kids instead of being hungover
- put up some pictures
- did some DIY that I’ve been putting off
- making plans for a holiday instead of sitting in my house getting drunk by myself

It was so traumatizing being in that hospital bed, hooked up to the machines. My heart rate was so elevated, I felt like I couldn’t breathe. The first week was hell, I felt so terrible. I had to go on a bland diet, which was the worse as a foodie. 

My relationship with alcohol started about 10 years ago, when I was a freshman in college. Ever since then, I have not gone more than 2 weeks without drinking, and I’m 27 now. I was mostly a weekend drinker, and mostly able to moderate. But I started to notice that in party settings I’d end up binge drinking and get blackout drunk, every couple of months or so.

I always told myself I needed to take a break or stop but never did. That experience getting alcohol gastritis changed me, and I truly don’t have the desire to drink. Don’t get me wrong, there were maybe like 3 days during the month where it was a bit challenging. it was my first Christmas, and New Years without drinking and I did think about it, but ultimately decided my health is more important.

And it’s so worth it because physically and mentally I feel better than ever. I finally am having vivid dreams again and my mind feels clearer.

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*



I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.



Maybe you're new to r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.



It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!



\---



\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!



What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.



\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.



\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning (or evening, depending on your time zone). Thank you all for allowing me to host the DCI this week. I am super excited.



Tonight, I am going to keep it light since we have a whole week of fun ahead of us....  



I'd like to talk about how music has been one of my biggest anchors in recovery. Music's been a safe haven through lyrics, rhythms, and melodies. It's given me a way to connect with emotions and process my feelings in ways I never thought I could. 



The one song that has helped me the most through recovery has been ""Rocketman"" by Elton John. 



I know that Bernie wrote the song itself about the isolation of space travel. 

But to me, it always felt like Elton was singing to me about my journey as an alcoholic - the feeling of being so disconnected and away- it was like I was living on Mars, alone, cold, and with nowhere to really go, but I missed everyone on earth deeply. 



So, my question for tonight is- what song has helped you in your recovery journey?

1q9q6ys,I quit.,"I’m 39. Yesterday I decided to quit drinking. For good this time. 
I’ve toyed with the idea for years. Nothing good comes from alcohol except for a temporary good time. My dad was an alcoholic who died from drinking. I also lost an uncle and nearly my husband to alcoholism. But they were true alcoholics. They needed a drink to stop the shakes, to feel normal. Not me. I don’t crave alcohol. I drink very rarely nowadays. I had my fun. But in the right setting, I’ll easily lose control. A girls night, a work party. I’ll tell myself “you don’t want a hangover, pace yourself. You can have a few without getting drunk”. As the buzz sets in, I justify it by telling myself, “I never do this, it’s ok every now and then. I deserve to let loose and relax”. Shortly after, I’m drunk. I’m not in control. I do and say things that I wouldn’t when I’m sober. I’ll usually drive. I am so lucky to have never gotten a DUI. When I’m drunk, I’m invincible. 
The hangovers are the worst. They last for 3 days and I feel like death. I have 2 young kids and a sober husband. They don’t care that I’m hungover. I cry when I’m hungover. I’m embarrassed that I let myself get to that level of intoxication. I can’t remember the whole night. I worry I did something to embarrass myself or the people I was with. I hate myself. 
When I drink at home, it’s because I’m stressed. Tension has been building and I need to relax, to disassociate. But it’s never just one drink. Most often it’s a bottle of wine. 
Last night I was stressed. I went to the liquor store and got a box of wine. After the kids went to bed, my husband and I sat down to watch a movie. We got in a stupid argument about the movie while we were watching. I don’t remember it exactly. I had had 2 glasses of wine by then, which was probably more like 3-4 because I always fill it up. I was getting buzzed. I was drinking fast. I was getting ready to pour another. 
I remember my husband was making fun of the movie and I was defending it because I was enjoying it. I finally got annoyed enough that I shut the tv off. My husband got up and walked down the hall to our bedroom and muttered “yeah okay (my name), have another”. I froze. I asked him what he meant by saying that. He said that every time I drink, I get argumentative “over the dumbest shit”. I started to cry. I can’t remember exactly what I said but I apologized. I left the room and kept crying. I was ashamed. He was mad. I had ruined our night. The precious little time we get alone together. That was it. That was the last time I was going to let my drinking negatively affect my life again. I went to the kitchen and dumped the wine.

Désolée, mais c'est un long message !

Mon père était très exigeant avec moi. Quand j'avais 94% dans mon bulletin, il disait que j'aurai du avoir 100%. Quand j'avais 2 médailles d'argent et 1 de bronze dans une compétition, il disait pourquoi tu n'as pas eu 3 médailles d'or.

Tout ça pour dire que j'ai toujours voulu en faire plus et être parfaite.

Mon père était un homme bien ordinaire, qui ne réussisait pas bien à l'école.  Son père payait les enseignantes, pour qu'il réussisse.

Je ne l'avais pas vu depuis 30 ans. Sa femme (Cécile) ne m'aimait pas et ça créait des conflits. Exemple: Il est fâché que je le l'appelle pas, mais sa femme Cécile ne faisait pas les messages. Ça a fait une chicane entre nous. Il n'a pas voulu qu'on en parle, il est disparu dans ma vie.

J'ai su que Cécile est morte en juillet. J'ai eu envie de revoir mon père après 30 ans d'absence. Je buvais toujours, une bouteille de vin presque tous les soirs,

Puis en octobre, j'ai osé appelé mon père, une femme m'a répondue. C'étais sa maîtresse depuis 10 ans. Cécile est morte en juillet et la maîtresse en entrée au conso en août.

J'ai arrêté de boire en novembre 2024.

Mon père me disait être super heureux qu'on se voit .

Mais encore une fois, il a voulu décider de ma vie, mais j'ai plus de 60 ans.

J'ai voulu mettre mes limites et qu'on parle, mais mon père de 92 ans m'a bloquée partour. A ce moment j'ai recommencé à boire.

Maintenant , il est malade, ça fait 2 ans qu'on ne se voit pas, sa femme me demande de venir le voir. Je n'en ai pas envie \*\*\*

Aujourd'hui, je ne bois plus depuis 1 an, j'ai un nouveau traitement intraveineux qui me fait du bien et je souhaite que la vie soit bonne pour moi.

Merci de m'avoir lue, juste d'écrire , m'a fait du bien !

1q9p63x,"Tell me your story. While I’m not brand new, I’m seeking guidance from those who once felt they didn’t know who they were. If you can’t offer guidance, give your story regardless.","TL;DR:. Tell me your story. I’m telling some of mine. whether you’re new, back at it, Or decades sober. I’d like to hear you contribute.

Hi all,

Everybody, especially addicts, have a story. Sharing these stories can be cathartic,  traumatizing, insightful, or inspiring.

I’ve been off alcohol for about 2 years and two months now. I’ve had had a good 16 months of full sobriety before I began exploring or revisiting things other than alcohol. I never got physically and mentally addicted to anything else the way I did booze, but I definitely put a big pause on the progress I was making. I realized while I was having fully sober days, there was still this sense of escapism. That due to my substance use starting from at age of 12, I never really let myself “become” anyone. Well I obviously did, but who is he?

You know the accurate trope for many addicts. That they wake up one day not knowing who they are anymore? That they got lost somewhere and need to get back home? I’ve never had that. I’m multiple weeks fully sober, still same 14 months alcohol free. I’ve been attending groups, going to therapy and I’ve been trying new things as often as I can. I feel like a piece of me is terrified that “What if who I am doesn’t like anything except consumption?” Not just consumption of substances but of food, books, media, and heavy phone dopamine addiction. A consumer not a creator.

I’m grateful to have many many very close friends and family. Despite being introverted, I have a LOT of good people in my life. They all speak so highly of me. I try as often as I can to uplift them in kind. I don’t need to solicit hearing earnest kind words like “people are drawn to you”, “you put people at ease”, and “you’re one of the most compassionate people I know.” I sure as hell would like to know this guy people talk about. My goal for this year is “learn to be confidently, fully myself, whoever the hell that is.” Do I subconsciously have people fooled or

All I know about myself is the following:

1. I am an addict and my life is incompatible with substances

2. I love to cook learn , read, and write. I’m nourishing that to the best of my ability 

3. I’m a dreamer but undisciplined. I abhor routine but do well under it 

4. I’m lucky. While life has been difficult, I’m not my trauma, I’m not the trauma I’ve caused others, and when confronted with these feelings I need to sit with them. My community is one of my greatest assets. Don’t ruminate and take accountability.

5. I am an introverted extrovert. I need people, but I’ve always needed a real extrovert to kick that door in. How do I learn to do this on my own? How do I learn to love myself and know myself the way my loved ones know me? If I had a 1/3 of the qualities people thrust up on me I’d at least be a flawed and interesting person I’d want to know.

So for the once lost, currently lost, the miscreants, ne’er do wells, those who started drinking too soon or too much - how did you get to know yourself? What about love yourself? Has a book or hobby or habit helped you? Is there something you revisit when you feel lost? 

While I am seeking guidance, I’m also seeking  fearless

connection. if you don’t have wisdom it I’d love to hear your stories, tell me about you, your journey, your new found or revisited spark. Whether two days sober or twenty years, your voice is valuable. 

Hell, even making this post I kinda chuckle at the irony of knowing I’m not my thoughts but here I am pathologizing, seeking answers to questions that don’t have one. If they do, they’re mine alone to answer.

It might just be mindset, self nurturing, and time. Connection in the mean time won’t hurt.

TL;DR: Tell me your story. Whether you can offer guidance as somebody who also stunted themself with alcohol before developing hobbies or knowing yourself, what helped you with this in your sobriety? 

For those who did know but lost themself, what kept you straight & narrow while sobriety walked you home?  

Lastly, if you’re in the same boat with me & have no true understanding of who you are tell me your story. Sometimes commiserating or even saying your story out in the ether helps.  You, myself, or passersby’s.

Books, media, mindset , habits, hobbies, speaking the yet unspoken. Anything that helps or helped that was strictly for you, I’d love to hear it. I don’t mind if you have no guidance, I hope you use this thread to share your story & perspective because it matters

I don't touch liquor, my weight is healthy and not increasing. I do not get ""drunk"" or really change how I act. I just drink it. I never wakeup hungover or late for work. I fear what used to be a habit has no turned into more of a dependency as I look forward to getting home from work and cracking open a nice cold beer.

The only nights I don't drink is if I'm sick, and when my wife was in the hospital due to pregnancy complications and I would need to drive at a moments notice. It was during this time I realized my sleep improved, energy levels went up, and anxiety decreased. 

I suffer from anxiety as well. Although this has improved DRAMATICALLY over the years, I started drinking more to relax and it started to take a bit more over the years to reach that same relaxing state. It's been about 5 years of this behavior.

I want to control it more, have some drinks on a Friday and or Saturday but none on the weekends. Maybe one or two beers max during the football game. The problem is I don't want to stop, I know I can but I don't want to. I'm a father now to a beautiful almost 8 month old and I want to be a good influence.

1q9noyv,90 days!!!,"I can't believe I almost forgot to post here after spending so much time today reading everyone's stories. 

This is the second longest I have gone without drinking since I was 18 and really the first time sober, the last time was at the beginning of the year after a short detox and I would say I was dry then, not sober. I didn't drink but I didn't put in any work at all and basically just stayed inside the whole time. That worked right until it didn't and I was back to drinking from wake up until pass out.

This time I did a full 7 day detox and attended every class they offered and committed to learning everything I could. As soon as I got out I started into an IOP (intensive outpatient) and dedicated as much time working on my sobriety as I used to drinking. 

It took me many meetings before I found my forever AA home group that I cherish dearly and last week I was able to get an awesome sponsor and start working the steps. 

I used to be one of the ""AA isn't for me"" types but Christmas was hard. So brutally brutally hard and isolating and I found so much comfort sitting in my home group Christmas eve. We watched movies and had an ice cream bar and it was filled with other people as depressed as I was, though we were quickly laughing and checking in on one another. 

This go around in feeling much more hopeful, mainly because of the work on myself I have put in and the support groups I have found.

I’ve struggled with alcoholism since my last baby was born due to postpartum depression. I drank almost every day for about four years, usually a 375ml bottle of vodka plus some coolers. I had a few short sobriety streaks, but mostly I was drinking daily.

I really thought pregnancy would make this easier, especially since I had already gone a month without drinking not long before getting pregnant. I was attending AA then, but never had a sponsor because I didn’t feel connected. Lately I’ve been wanting to go back, or maybe find a women-only group.

I’m scared of judgment because I’m visibly pregnant with my second baby. Most days I miss alcohol and even dream about it. It was a huge part of my routine and how I coped with my C-PTSD, ADHD, and other mental health issues.

I’m in therapy and eating disorder treatment, but nothing has helped the way alcohol did. I have no plans to drink, especially while pregnant, but I’m terrified of how I’ll feel after the baby is born.

1q9naqm,Give me motivation to not drink,"So, I’ve made it 10 days! That feels impossible and I’m so grateful that I have done it. But, I’m starting to get antsy and the thoughts about drinking are pretty frequent right now. In particular, I have anxiety about staying strong this coming week. This will be a massive challenge for me. 

I start work travel again tomorrow. I spend a lot of time in and out of airports and hotels. I usually get to see friends in the evenings on these work trips which usually means dinners and happy hours. I have two official work dinners - one where we are “meeting for wine” and another where we are “celebrating” a new hire. I’m actually excited about bringing this person on, but I’m very concerned about how to celebrate sober without making it weird for this 3 person dinner (including the new hire). For the meeting over wine, I don’t want to make that other person (who I have a lot of respect for) feel awkward by me not drinking and them drinking alone. 

How do I deal with it being so awkward to say I’m not drinking? For both personal and work meetings. I had a work colleague who dropped by the house tell me today, “I’m surprised you’re sticking to dry January.” Ouch.

1q9mzdg,2 Year Sober-versary,"Two years ago today, I was discharged from the hospital after being treated for sepsis caused by alcoholic ketoacidosis, and after being medically detoxed.

It wasn’t my first detox.

Fourteen months earlier, I had gone through one before, convinced I just needed a break. I wasn’t committed to sobriety. I told myself that one day I could drink again, that *one drink couldn’t hurt*. That lie nearly cost me my life.

That “one drink” became a week-long binge I have no memory of. I stopped eating. My body, desperate to survive, tried to sustain itself on alcohol alone. I was actively dying, and the only reason I ended up in the ER was because I collapsed on my bedroom floor, violently vomiting, unable to keep even a sip of water down.

And what terrified me most wasn’t that I couldn’t drink the water.
It was that I couldn’t drink more vodka.

My husband was deployed. I was alone. I was taken to the ER, where the first hours of detox brought horrific hallucinations; images and sensations I wish my brain had never learned how to create. Nurses struggled to find a vein. A newer nurse dug so deeply she caused nerve damage; I lost all feeling from my wrist to my elbow. That numbness didn’t begin to fade until six months ago.

The experience was traumatic. And the realization that I had almost killed myself was undeniable.

After my first detox, I hadn’t healed. I was still carrying the weight of my alcoholism. Still shut off from the world. Still holding my shame in silence.

Today, two years later, everything is different.

I’ve committed to a lifetime of sobriety, and the difference is profound. I’ve finally started healing the trauma I once tried to outrun with alcohol. I’m in the best shape of my adult life at 36. My relationships are deeper, more honest, more open than I ever thought possible. And for the first time in as long as I can remember, I genuinely believe my life is good, and worth living.

I’m… dare I say it… happy.
And that is enough for me.

So here’s to two years.

And if you’re reading this with two hours, two days, or two months, wherever you are in your journey, please hear this: it gets better, even if you can’t believe that yet.

The hopelessness, the darkness, the voice telling you there’s no way out, it’s a lie! A trick your mind plays when it’s worn down by addiction and fear. It feels real because you’re inside it, but it is not the truth of who you are or what your life can be.

There *is* light on the other side of this. I couldn’t see it either. I was certain my life was over. But slowly, quietly, that light found me, and one day I realized I wasn’t just surviving anymore. I was living.

You don’t need to see the whole path forward. Just stay. One moment, one choice at a time. The darkness doesn’t win.

Your life is worth fighting for.

1q9lg7i,Not the comma day I was expecting,"A few months ago, I did my best to make sure that I would have plans to be skiing somewhere on a mountain on my 1000th day sober.  Conveniently, there is a sober group in my city that had a ski trip planned this weekend, but the universe had other plans for me I guess.  A couple of months ago, I was diagnosed with Testicular Cancer, and I am currently stuck in and out of the hospital ripping through chemotherapy rounds. 

Cancer sucks.  I don't have anything insightful to say about my diagnosis or the way that my life has to be right now for me to get better.  But, I do feel grateful that I got sober and learned how to start to live and feel.  

The last few years of my drinking were painfully lonely, and I was ready to kill myself over obstacles far more trivial than a metastatic cancer diagnosis. I basically had nothing and no one in my life, and I moved from temporary situation to temporary situation sucking up everyone and everything around me until I felt I was being asked to leave.

One thousand days later, my life is completely unrecognizable.  I have had a lot of real accomplishments, and it's easy to point to the most tangible ones (career, physical appearance, etc.) to communicate to people who used to know me that I have started to get better.  While it's really easy to show someone else and external change, I find it very difficult at times to show someone how you have changed internally.  

The day I finally went to detox and decided quit for real, I thought I was making the choice to not wake up with withdrawals every morning, to not have to make excuses for why I was late to work all the time, to not have to go to 3 different liquor stores every day to hide how much alcohol I was buying, etc.  And while I have certainly outgrown all of those things, I did not truly understand the journey I was embarking on until much later.  Working an active program has taught me to build relationships, set boundaries, have goals and try to accomplish them, how to be comfortable with myself, and how to experience feelings (sometimes bad feelings).  It took having these gifts gradually appear in my life as I continued to live sober to prove to me that I truly was drinking to die toward the end.  

I would never say this in a cancer sub or group meeting, but I am confident that this cancer won't kill me.  For a diagnosis like mine, testicular cancer is pretty well cured as long as you get the treatment (which is brutal).  If I start drinking again, I will not only die young, but I will also deprive myself of the chance to ever have lived in the first place.

If you're new to sobriety or haven't strung a day sober in a long time want to, be kind to yourself. The race is long.

1q9ldoj,I have to be done. I have to. I have to.,"I've been dealing with a drinking problem for years now. I'm 30f and half of my 20's has been battling this problem.

I can go weeks to months without drinking. I'll feel excellent about my progress, not feel the need or urge to drink without consulting the coping skills that I've spent years obtaining from Intensive Outpatient programs, addiction counselors and mental health counselors. 

And then it's like a pin drops and that's it. That 2-3 month sobriety streak will be completely ruined. All the good that I'd done for that feels erased, and not just to me. To my family, to the love of my life. I actually like a completely different person when I drink, and I'll be on a 2 day bender trying to avoid the inevitable fucking treacherous hangover with the ""hair of the dog"". 

I don't know what to do to practice when that pin starts to fall. How do I catch it when it happens so infrequently? I know my anxiety triggers and I can address them pretty successfully, but I feel like honestly it HAS to be boredom that I can't get control of. I don't know what else it could be. 

And I've developed some compulsive cleaning/organizing mechanisms to get my mind off of it and I can also be quite successful doing that, but not always. And I really, really need it to be always. I don't trust myself anymore and neither do my loved ones and I don't blame them.

1q9kvcw,262 Day Update,"272 Day Update

Hello everybody. I posted here back in April and have been lurking ever since. Long story short, I was in a bad way last April already when my dad had a serious stroke. That was unfortunately the catalyst I needed to finally take the plunge and quit drinking. It's been a long, scary, incredibly challenging 262 days, but all things considered I am in a much better place now than I ever thought possible even with everything going on. 

Doctors had been telling me to quit for health reasons for several years, and I can't believe I waited so long to listen. 

Anxiety and blood pressure are in check and I'm off of 2 blood pressure meds and one anxiety med. Insomnia is still a major challenge but I'm getting much better sleep now that I'm not drinking. I've resolved many financial issues in my life and headed back towards a normal credit score. Most recently I've re-enrolled in school and working to finish my almost-completed bachelor's degree from over 10 years ago. 

Life still sucks sometimes. Dad's health is still poor. Working, caregiving, and traveling 200 miles between those two responsibilities every week is wearing on me. The desire to drink comes on strong when the going gets tough, but I've stayed strong even with other caretakers drinking in the house and reuniting with old drinking buddies now that I'm back in my home town more. 

Stopping drinking didn't solve all of my problems, but boy did it help.

If you are considering quitting, there is no time like the present. If I have one regret, it's not doing it sooner. 

Thanks to everyone on here for the support and help along the way. This is only my second post in 8 months, but I've been lurking and the stories, good and bad, have helped keep me going. I've learned so much from all of you, and I thank you all.

Now, I feel like I’ve been given a massive time rebate. Here is what I’ve gained:

• I can always drive home: No more waiting in the cold for cabs or staring at Uber apps. Which also means no more… 

• ""retrieving the car"": I don't lose half my weekend mornings figuring out how to get my car back from where I abandoned it.

• I don't pass out: I’m present for the whole evening. I don’t miss the end of the story or the best part of the night.

• The Mornings: I’ve traded hours of ""recovering"" on the sofa for hours of actually living.

• The Exit Strategy: I can and do leave events/parties/drinks when the chat gets loud, repetitive and slurred. If a party is boring, I just get in my car and go.

I’m no longer a passenger waiting for hangovers to pass or rides to arrive. Today, I’m the driver.

1q9j6p7,Day 14 : I’d like to share my journey,"Greetings all, long time lurker but I’ve never posted or commented as I never felt it was fair to those making a real attempt at sobriety. I’ll try to condense things as much as possible but it will be a lengthy post. 

**Background**: 
I moved to a new city all by myself in November 2017 and within a month met the woman I’d eventually marry. I was 24 at the time and she was 21. She was also one of the few girls I’d ever met that actually liked whiskey. We were both already heavily into the electronic music scene and did our fair share of substances on the weekend, especially early in our relationship. However, alcohol was always our thing. We drank 3-4 days per week whether it was bars, concerts, at the pool or even just chilling at home. 

Everything changed when COVID hit in 2020, my wife was furloughed at the time and I was working from home. It was fun at first, we could drink all day and had no obligation to be anywhere. We were in a small 1 bed 1 bath apartment at the time, the only space for a desk was in our bedroom. I’m on the phone for work a lot so she’d be trying to sleep while I’m on the phone with contractors at 7am. We decided we wanted more space, started house hunting and wound up finding a great house in the suburbs for a great price. 

We got married in New Orleans in May 2023, drinking was a huge part of the experience. We managed to not get too lit and had a wonderful time that we actually were able to remember. 

**when the problem started** 
I was part of a 2 man team managing the financial side of a $350,000,000 construction project. He was a great boss, mentor and friend. In January 2024 he called me out of the blue to say he’s leaving the company to start his own. I was happy for him but it put a ton of pressure on me as I was now having to handle his client-facing responsibilities and work load on top of my responsibilities. I also had to travel once per month for a site visit which was something he’d normally do since he lived in town. 

I had been pretty good about not drinking during work hours but as the stressed piled up I found myself making a run to the liquor store in the late morning/early afternoon to get 3-4 of those disgusting 99 proof liqueur shots. Soon that became a daily habit plus my wife would bring home some shots when she was off work. 

Later that year my wife and I had a week long stay at an all inclusive resort in Mexico, I was beyond excited to step away from work plus I could drink as much as I wanted. I blacked out a few days and also got cut off a few times. Our last night there we were both shitfaced and got into an argument that cumulated in my wife screaming **“you’ve ruined the one vacation that we had together this year. I hate you. Do you hear me? I fucking hate you!”** I’ll never forget it, she fell asleep immediately after and when we woke up to head to the airport she didn’t even remember it. While she was apologetic and affectionate, I knew there was a part of what she said that was true. I hated myself and knew what we had grown into wasn’t sustainable. That’s when I recognized that I had a problem. 

I was getting burnt out of the job due to the lack of support plus the project itself was nearing completion. My former boss called me out of the blue in march 2025 saying a friend of his needed help on a $7,000,000,000 project. I transitioned jobs because that was good good of an opportunity to pass up and that’s where I work currently. The project is unlike anything I’ve ever worked on but it is stressful, demanding and chaotic. 

Those 3-4 99 shots turned into a daily 8 and I’d be at the liquor store 20 minutes after it opened. I’d been battling a depression because it felt like I traded one stressful job for another. I got started on Zoloft which provided immense relief at first but it kinda plateaued after a few weeks so I had my dr up the dosage in early December 2025. 

**the tipping point** 
On 12/27/25 my wife dragged me to one of those timeshare presentations where they try to sell you the world but you get a free week vacation even if you don’t buy anything. I felt weird all morning and was having some sort of double vision (while sober) and overall just felt off. The presenter even noticed something was off and asked if I was alright. I was just focused on getting through the presentation so we could grab some drinks and go home plus my parents were coming into town and I was excited to see them. I remember greeting them and watching some football but that’s about it. That would be my last day drinking. 

I woke up on 12/28/25 with a hangover, but it felt different than other hangovers. I was sweating and shaking profusely as well as constantly vomiting even though my stomach was empty. My mom eventually convinced me to go to the ER. 

We sat in the waiting room for 2 hours before my name was called. I could barely walk to the wheelchair they brought for me. During the assessment I had a seizure followed by a loss of pulse and I was turning cyanotic (blue). CPR was administered along with defibrillation, upon return of pulse I was given epinephrine and then moved to the ICU. My wife, as my emergency contact, got to be the one to receive the news and then inform my parents. 

I woke up with my hands restrained to a bed, ventilator tube down my throat and a Foley catheter in my manhood. Also was given fentanyl for the pain / sedation so I had no idea what was going on. My dad stayed overnight with me, my poor wife had been through so much emotionally that day and needed rest. She and my mom fell asleep on the living room couch watching comfort movies. 

My dad informed me of the events that transpired but I was unable to speak due to the intubation. The nurse suggested seeing if I could write on a piece of paper, first thing I wrote was “tube out” which wasn’t gonna happen yet. Then “water” which was not possible with the tube. After that was “nose itch” which resulted in my dad scratching all over my nose until he finally found the spot, it was fairly comical. The last thing I wrote was “photo” and my dad got an amazing photo of me, hooked up to all these machines, ice pack on my head, with a thumbs up. I wanted the photo as a reminder of what I did to myself. Another notable part was how much my dad held my hand and even at one point kissed my forehead saying “you got this buddy”. I can’t even remotely remember anything like that happened with him. 

Once I was stable and able to breathe on my own (around 24 hours) they removed the tube which hurt but pales in comparison to the removal of the Foley catheter. That was probably the worst thing I have ever physically experienced. 

I spent a total of 10 days in the hospital, first 2 were in the ICU before “graduating” to a regular hospital room. Tests were ran and images were taken. Had to be honest about my drinking as my liver was enlarged and unhappy. An MRI revealed a heart condition (genetic) called Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, essentially a thickening of the heart walls that can cause arrhythmia and makes the heart work harder. I had to have surgery to get a defibrillator implanted in my chest in the event that my pulse ever stops again. 

I’m lucky to be alive, who knows what would have happened if I seized up and went into cardiac arrest at home. The lead cardiologist referred to it as a “death attempt”. I was fortunate to be going through the initial withdrawals while under medical supervision, they hooked me up with anti nausea and anti seizure medications. To be honest, the cravings haven’t even been that bad since I was discharged. 

This event made me realize how fortunate I am to have a strong support system. My wife was amazing the whole time, she was strong and caring, stayed in the hospital with me every night besides the first. She even called my boss from my cell phone to inform him of the situation. My parents stayed at our house for over a week longer than originally planned to help with our household and be there to support me and my wife. It makes me feel awful about who I was at the height of my drinking. The hiding it, the excuses to “run out” to do something just so I could grab more drinks, falling asleep in the middle of the day, gaining weight, no interest in hobbies, knowing which stores open early on the weekend, vomiting all the time, stumbling around at concerts, the list could go on forever. 

12/27/25 was the day of my last drink and I am ready to take sobriety seriously. I know it won’t be easy but I’ve been given a new lease on life and plan on making the most out of it. I’ve already joined an outpatient program and also look forward to utilizing this community.

1q9izjk,No one to tell but I hit 550 days without a drink,"I don't really have anyone to tell but I just wanted to share with everyone here. Like many of you I wanted to quit drinking, but struggled every time I tried to stop. If I was lucky I might make it a week before I thought I could moderate my intake before winding up right back where I was. This went on for years. I was sort of vaguely aware I had a problem but was using drinker's math to delude myself into thinking I was drinking less than I actually was.  On a normal day I was consuming 10-15 drinks a day. On weekends and holidays it would be over 20 drinks a day. I recall one Thanksgiving 2 years ago  I started out drinking at 9am. Once I was out of beer I didn't even think twice of getting into my car to to to the nearest liquor store to pick up a handle of gin and some bottles of tonic water. Then proceeded to drink the entire bottle the entire afternoon into the evening before I finished it. 

I was at a point where hangovers didn't even happen any longer. 

Almost no one knew how much I drank because I just isolated myself. The one or two who did said they never saw someone consume as much alcohol as I did.

I also have severe bipolar 1 with psychotic features. I was also untreated for PTSD. I take a lot of heavy duty psychiatric medications at high dosages, the sort you're not supposed to even drink on but I didn't care. I guess in a way I was trying to commit suicide without doing so in a quick manner. 

I finally started questioning what I was really doing when I tried to justify to a therapist my drinking. She told me I also needed to be honest with my psychiatrist about my real intake. Which I did and I felt such intense shame in doing so. Thanks to the two of them, we were able to figure out I had untreated PTSD. While on medical leave for my bipolar disorder, I decided to take a shot at quitting again wondering if I could even make it to a week. I decided to cold turkey.

Let me just say I don't recommend going this route. But the short of it is I made it to a week, then just kept fighting to add one day at a time. Soon I made it to three weeks, and the struggles of those initial several weeks of withdrawal subsidized. I just looked at it as a challenge to myself to get through each day without a drink. As the weeks went by I found it to become easier and easier. In my head I knew I never wanted to go back to that life of waiting for when the first or next drink would be. 

My life slowly turned around and things began to fall into place for me. I met the love of my life unexpectedly. I started to gain better control over my life at large. I started to feel happiness that I hadn't felt in many years again. When I took my first blood test after having quit a few months later, my liver function had finally returned to normal. 

550 days later, I don't miss drinking. 

If I want a beer, I just buy a non-alcoholic one and have that. 

I can sit in a room where everyone is drinking and not care one bit. 

I can go into a liquor store without any urge to buy anything for myself. I just look at the brands of every type of liquor or beer I used to consume with nothing more than regret over it 

I accepted there is no such thing as 1 drink for myself. 1 drink will always turn into 10+. I don't just know that I can't have 1 drink, I feel it inside me so completely that it alone makes me never want another drink for the rest of my life.

1q9i02p,"Friends went out, so glad I didn’t","Background: So far it’s been 10 days without a single drink, it feels small but I honestly don’t think I’ve gone that long in a few years. I took note of my alcohol dependence a while ago, but after last summer  things snowballed downhill and I started losing control (or maybe not caring, like depression it can be cyclical). My mental health plummeted a scary amount. 

During December I recognized I needed a change before I lose complete control and ruin my life. For the first time in a while, I started thinking to the future. I wanted to continue life in the best way possible, and part of it is with a good grasp on my relationship with alcohol. I don’t know if I’ll cut it out completely, but setting boundaries doing dry january felt like a less-scary start. I really just take it day by day, and I’ve already noticed improvements. 

Short story long, I could not be happier that I didn’t go out and drink with my friends last night (if I weren’t doing dry january I know that I would have). Apparently the night started fine for them, but things took a turn for the worse when they got to the bar. Two of my friends drank way more than they should have in a very short period of time (on top of not eating proper dinner). My sober friend there was the dd, and apparently it was messy. 

I was told they kept stumbling, spilling people’s drinks, falling over many times, and had to be carried out of the bar. Also throwing up inside/outside of the bar. Then in the car which still needs to be cleaned. They don’t drink like that often at all, and I think they just forgot their tolerance, but it was an all around a very bad situation. I feel empathetic because I know that being that drunk sucks ass, especially having to face everything the morning after. Obviously if I were there (sober) I would have helped them get home and be safe, but I’m so glad I didn’t go out. It felt like a reminder for why I’m doing this. I know it sounds crude to call that terrible night a mini win for myself, but that’s honestly how I feel.

I was cleaning in the house and found a partial bottle of liquor stashed away (both husband and I are quitting together both 8 days). We didn't remember it being there so I went to throw it away.. instead my sneaky alcoholic self restashed it... After about five minutes.. I brought it to my husband, I said "" I'm sorry.. I'm throwing this out.. I tried hiding it, but I realized I don't know why.. I was never going to drink it."" I threw it away. I'm proud of myself for circumventing that little voice, shutting it down and not giving in. I'm done. I'm done feeling awful. I'm done with the hanxiety. Done with passing out and not being held by my husband. Since quitting my favorite cat started to cuddle at night. Since quitting I have more energy, I feel good about myself. I feel more love for my husband. I look forward to the new routine we have at night instead of watching the clock until I could drink. I'm so tired of that life.

1q9gkha,Day 10 changes,"Celebrating double digits! Here are today’s observations:

I’ve baked chocolate chip cookies twice this week. No regrets. I still count my calories, but without the extra 1500 I was drinking each night, I can have cookies all the time and still be good! 

I have worked out twelve times in the last ten days, whereas I used to hope for 3-4 days per week. It’s amazing how much time gets added to each day when your workout window doesn’t end at 5pm. This morning I was in the gym before the sun was up. I’ve always thought I just wasn’t a morning workout person, but I’m sheepishly realizing it was just the alcohol. 

Another side effect I’ve noticed so far is that I’m no longer overheating constantly. For years, I’ve kept my home around 64-66F, I would wake up from overheating every night, and fan myself all day at work. 

Now, it’s 70 in this room and I’m in a sweatshirt and slippers with a blanket. Never even considered I might cut my electric bill through this process. 

Finally, my resting HR used to be in the 40s and 50s, eventually got up to the 90s. Today, 64. 

It’s nice to actually observe and measure my body recalibrating. ✨",1768081259.0,35,3,stopdrinking,substance
1q9ghoa,43 days - almost cracked/questions,"Sooo…I am 43 days without a drink. I almost cracked today and almost went to my store which is only a half mile from my home. The sad part is they know me, they know my name and always greet me by name when I walk in. I did not go. I drank heavily for the past 4 years…10-15 ipa’s a day/night. I always drank until passing out which made me sleep all night.

43 days in, I still can’t sleep normally. Some nights I don’t sleep at all and my body eventually just shuts down days later from complete exhaustion. It feels similar to a drunk blackout. It’s not a restful sleep.

43 days ago I spent 2 weeks detoxing and seizing in the hospital. When released I was told if I drank one more time I would certainly die. This thought eventually caused me to snap out of it and not make that purchase.

My questions are….is anyone else this far in and experiencing similar things? I have daily bad anxiety, sleep problems as already mentioned, blood pressure is all over the place (sometimes normal, sometimes very high), fast heart rate, daily exhaustion, some neuropathy.

I know my time off the booze is not a super long time but I figured by now I’d at least be able to sleep. Any thoughts?

I've just crossed 6 months of sobriety. It's been one of, if not the most, life changing things I've done. I've never loved life as much as I do now. 

I truly have no desire to drink at the moment. I've had 2 really stressful weeks at work, having to let go of 3 employees, covering their shifts working 12 hour days, and I didn't contemplate drinking once. That's fucking insane to me. 

I've done a lot of work, it wasn't just that I stopped drinking. Therapy, lots of journaling, lots of work and holding myself accountable. 

I guess I'm just wondering how others felt at 6 months. I'm guessing my biggest risk to relapsing is getting too confident or comfortable? I've committed to not dating my first year so I could see getting back into dating being a risk? But I honestly feel totally over it.

I am attempting Dry January for the first time and I've been doing pretty good, made it to day 10!!

I've been stuck in the habit of drinking four tallboys after work everyday for the last I don't know, 4 to 4.5 years? I like to drink alone... I can control myself in a social setting but best believe I'm getting hammered in the comfort of my own home. It's stripped me of everything... I have very few friends now, I've ruined relationships with girls because of my drinking problem, I gave up on hobbies I used to love partaking in, my life revolves around when and where I can get beer (hasn't for the last 10 days and it's been really nice!!).

I thought that once I graduated college, I'd dial it back a bit... I did the opposite. I've had many rock bottoms over the years, or at least I thought. Blow a tire on the highway at 2am on a Tuesday in the pouring down rain while on a combination of light beers and xanax... parents saved my ass from the state troopers. Got pulled over on the way home from Fake Paddys day... somehow made it out with a warning despite being inebriated. Got arrested for open container in public + underage... somehow got the charges dropped. Many other events like that over time, and yet I still find myself drinking.

I'm proud of the 10 days I've put together... haven't done more than 2-3 days ever. But it's now Saturday, 12:30pm and it's going to be cold and rainy all day. I have nothing to do, no responsibilities... a few beers are on the mind. Normally I would go snowboarding, or go to the gym, or work on my creative projects... but I have no motivation or drive. Haven't really had any since that last sip on December 31st. Is that common? To lack the drive and motivation to get things done/participate in your hobbies?

I've known for quite some time that I wanted to stop drinking but it has been one of the hardest things I've ever attempted.

I wouldn't even feel drunk, just sluggish and it would ruin my sleep and the morning after. 

Something just hit me last week and I became determined. I asked myself what positives I was gaining from alcohol... I couldn't come up with anything.

1q99ud8,Came home from rehab and went straight to drinking 😵‍💫,"I got into a argument with another client at the rehab I attend. She was adamant on taking my bottom bunk and I was forced to sleep on a top bunk which I have a very hard time getting in and out of because of my lower back pain. It was a dirty disgusting old mattress with bugs crawling all around it. I asked my counselor to get me another bottom bunk but he refused, pushed me on the floor and we got into a fight with the woman who took my bottom bunk. The police were called and I was taken to jail for assault. My mom bailed me out and I went home. As soon as I got home, I started drinking and the feeling of never getting sober again started to fill me with dread. Then I started crying and asking God why I just can't stay sober. Why me? I ended up crying myself awake with tears in my eyes. While I slowly started to fade into a consciousness I started to see my bottom bunk with all my surroundings and my kitty pillow and Harry Potter blanket. I wiped the tears from my eyes. It was a nightmare. It felt so unbelievably real. I thought I threw away 53 days of sobriety. Waking up from that dream is one of the most reliving moments of my life. 

I wasn't arrested for assaulting a cop. I still have my bottom bunk. I still have my good health. I still have my 53 days. I still have my hope. I'm still going to complete this rehab program.

Can anyone recommend an app that will allow me to track several different quit dates (mine are alcohol, cannabis, tobacco)

1q991l7,I didn’t quit drinking to become perfect. I quit to become present.,"I used to think sobriety was about fixing myself.

Being more productive.

More motivated.

More successful.

More impressive.

But the real change was quieter.

I started remembering conversations.

I started waking up without fear.

I stopped rehearsing apologies in my head.

I noticed my own emotions instead of drowning them.

I sat with boredom instead of running from it.

Some days are still hard. Some days I’m still messy. Some days I still want to escape.

But I’m here for my life now. Not half-here. Not numb. Not hiding.

If you’re on day 1: you’re not broken.

If you’re on day 100: you’re not done growing.

If you relapsed: you didn’t lose everything you learned.

You don’t have to become a new person.

You just have to stop abandoning the one you already are.

I’m almost a week sober. I decided I was going to do a dry January and while I fumbled a bit early on, I accepted the loss and kept pushing forward. I stopped drinking last Saturday. I will admit it hasn’t been easy, especially at night. My husband is super supportive (he hasn’t had a drink in probably 6 years) and got me tons of zero sugar soda and hard seltzers. We’re going to go get some NA beer today to help me feel more comfortable at night. I know NA beer can be controversial, but when I went 3 months sober earlier this year, it really helped me.

I still get that uncomfortable squirmy feeling at night, especially when I’m gaming, but my sleep has been improving, I’ve been going to bed at 12-12:30 instead of 2am an waking up at a reasonable time without shakes and without a headache. I love waking up with a clear head. I got up this morning, cleaned my aquarium, took care of the cats, and did the morning chores before my husband was even up. I’m starting to lose weight too. My husband said i look significantly less bloated and reminded me how beautiful he thinks I am, especially when I’m not drinking. I have Crohns Disease and I have noticed significant improvement in my symptoms since I cut the alcohol too. I no longer have to run to the bathroom after eating.

Sober life isn’t easy, especially in the beginnin , I have to make the conscious choice every morning, every afternoon, and every night that I am not going to drink. The positives are significantly outweighing the negatives though.

To those of you who are still in early sobriety with me, let’s white-knuckle another Saturday night and stay strong together.

1q97yh8,90 Days - The fog is lifting,"There is not a day that goes by where I do not reflect on this little corner of the internet and what it has meant to me.  I read almost every post and each time I am deeply thankful for the sense of community and encouragement here.

Thank you to everyone out there from the bottom of my heart.

90 days was the original stretch goal when I set out to do this.  I'm now going for 180.  Here are some thoughts:

* I had 100's of day 1s.  The first breakthrough was a Dry Jan a few years ago.  Each length of being sober, no matter how small, matters.
* During stretches of attempting to be sober, I always kept a journal.  It is cruel, unjust and down right evil how my mind would constantly try apply some sort of twisted bias on how wonderful being drunk could be and how much I was missing by being sober.
* I accounted for every small change I could notice during my attempts and wrote them down.  I literally had to read that top to bottom each time I was tempted to drink as a reminder that my mind was somehow blocking. 
* I also did pushups out of anger when I wanted a drink.  Whatever I was feeling, I got down and did pushups until I collapsed. In the beginning I could barely do 10.  Now I'm hitting the gym 2-3x a week.
* I used to smoke 15 yrs ago.  While smoking, I could not imagine ever getting up and having a coffee without a smoke.  Same thing with drinking.  I was terrified about losing my Sunday nights watching the game and drinking.  4-6 beers every day.  Benders.  Bottle of wine and 2 DIPAs. After 90 days, I can 100% say I no longer think like this.  Its unreal to me that this is possible.

This entire stretch of 90 has become an exercise in finding ways to fill the dopamine crush I used to get from drinking.  To me, 10 drinks and a night out with a fireplace and maybe some darts hits a dopamine score of 100.  Its damn near perfect....up until the morning where it goes to -100 dopamine, regret, pain in my stomach and ribs, swollen ankles and exhaustion.

I have come to realize I will never again score a 100 in my life.  However, for me, this is how I'm slowly making the progress towards feeling alive without alcohol (and their related scores on what they mean to me):

* Falling asleep in minutes (10)
* Fat wallet (7)
* Weight loss (7)
* Redness in face is near gone (5)
* Sex drive (5)
* Staying calm in moments of crises (4)
* Not being winded from climbing stairs (3)
* Clear competitive thoughts and connecting the dots at work (3)
* Desserts ( 2)
* Remembering my dreams - which are not as violent as before (1)
* Driving at night with zero stress (1)
* Fitting into old clothes (1)
* NA Beers (1)

I want to say again to this group : you all mean the world to me.  I honestly feel for the first time in my life that I will live longer and be able to watch my kids get married or have kids.  You all have given me the gift of life.",1768061395.0,73,10,stopdrinking,substance

We can’t control what happens to us, but we can control how we respond. Update your resume, make a few phone calls, and don’t sweat it. Pray for your friend and reach out to others who are also feeling the pain of your friend’s absence; it’s okay. Call someone who can help you with your car. But don’t get all worked up. It’s just a waste of energy.

Why do I lose my shit when things don’t go my way? What can I do to help myself not feel angry or frustrated during these moments?

**Daily Challenge**

Write a list of people willing to help you when the moment arises. Take some time to feel grateful for those relationships.

=================

I wrote this entry in 2022 after my best friend and sponsor died (two separate people) within a few months of one another. I was let go from a good job on December 19th. of that year. And my car blew a header the following month. It was rough. This last year, I was diagnosed with two tumors in my bladder, and currently, I am in the middle of cancer treatments. Everything I learned about how to deal with these moments, I learned in recovery. ""***We can’t control what happens to us, but we can control how we respond***."" And with that response, I have learned to identify what is in my control and what isn't. A lot of that comes with time, but most of that comes with responding as I describe above. Responding with radical acceptance means taking action within my abilities, engaging with acceptance, and understanding what is reasonably within my power. Not reaching for the bottle. Not putting off what needs to be done. Not saying ""fuck it"" or denying the reality.

Stay active. Stay sober.

But instead of letting myself use that as an excuse like normal, or being like whoops guess I’ll try again next January, I cut down a glass of wine per night (similar to how I quit cigarettes) and January 9 was my last, sad glass of alcohol. 

  
I cannot believe how fast it’s gone! I used to be so jealous of people with double, triple digits here and now I’ve got four years! The time passes whether we drink or not. 

  
I read this sub, took hot baths with hot tea every night, and focused on not drinking today. I told my husband not to offer to pick me up anything at the store or offer me a sip. I also had therapy on Mondays and did not want to have to tell her that I’d slipped up, so I didn’t.

  
The reason it stuck this time versus the dozens of other times I tried was because I made a plan, I found things to do to fill the time I would normally drink, and I just focused on today. If I thought about the future I’d get scared or mad; surely I’ll be able to drink at like, my kid‘s wedding in 30 years? I reminded myself to worry about that in 30 years, and to just focus on today.   


The first few weeks I was so tired and I allowed myself to just lay around and wallow in self pity. Once my energy came back I started powerlifting. Highly recommend. 

Because I wasn’t in a hungover fog all the time, I realized I had adhd and got evaluated for that. I have been at this job longer than any other job and have been promoted quite a few times. I’ve never made a fool of myself in front of my coworkers or had to spend time before an event planning how I’ll get home or how many drinks I’m “allowed” to have. I have hobbies again. If we needed to drive our kid to the ER (or our dog to the vet because she loves to fuck herself up on a good porcupine) I can do that now! 

So yeah, don’t let a slip up turn into an excuse, don’t think about whether you will drink at a future date, and make a plan (if I get too tempted at X event I will leave). But mostly, just say no to the first drink. Saying no to that first drink is so easy compared to drinking. Be nice to yourself; you can’t change the past and quitting is hard. And life won’t necessarily be easy once you quit, but alcohol will not make it any easier.

1q95999,I messed up so bad. Almost lost everything. Just needed to vent a bit and be honest. Long message. I want to be honest,"I got CPS in my life. The only thing I have to do is not being under the influence in presence of my kids. That's easy enough right?

December the 19th, I had custody of my children (it's 50/50). I was 3 weeks sober then. But my girlfriend of almost a year took more and more place in my house. I never wished to have her at my home ""permenantly"". I told her she got to go at her home for the time being. Which she did.

As I went back from her home, I went to the liquor store to buy a bottle of whiskey. I had enough, I needed that. I already knew I was going to leave her. Truth is I wasn't yet ready to have a relationship after my breakup with the mom of my childs in August 2023.

So I drank. Kids didn't have their diner meal that evening. My daugther was not able to wake me up. Called her mother crying. Their mother came to get the kids at 11:30 pm. She was also not able to wake me up. I woke up in the morning with a note on the table. ""I came to get the kids, you know why"".

I lost the costudy of my kids during the holydays. Starting December the 19th. The holydays after that were not good for me. Left my girlfriend, I was alone, I drank a lot.

I also lost my best friend over something I did while we were both drunk, I was totally alone.

December the 30th, I had my first ever suicidal thought. I called the crisis center the next morning to tell them that, I have so much pills at home it would be really easy, and asked what should I do. And I did a google research for that. ""Go to the emergency now"". Which I didn't.

January the 1st, something happened with the mother of my childs, which sent my in crisis. I don't want to talk about that particularly, but I was in distress, like I never had been. I talked to my ex in the morning. She was worried and called the crisis center. 2 social workers came to my home, unnanounced, talked to me. I explained the situation. They went off saying they were worried.

As the day passed, I was feeling less and less well. I called back to the crisis center to ask when is the right moment to decide when to go to the emergency. Had a small talk, told them I would think about it.

They (the social workers) came back a few hours later, maybe 9 PM. I told them I would refuse their services. We have a law here in Quebec called P38 that when someone is in danger for itself or somebody else, they can get taken care of against their will. That's what happened. Police showed up, I got into an ambulance, went to the hospital.

I stayed at the psychiatric emergency for a day and a half. Tranfered to the detox center for 2 days (it went really well that time).

Thuesday I had a meeting with the CPS. I'm losing custody of my childs for 1 month and need to treat myself, or start doing this. I have the right to have my childs at least one time a week. They are coming for diner this evening :)

I have a rendezvous with a psychiatrist at my clinic. After so long, I dont think the problem is alcohol. There's something else. I'll work for that.

- The bar had no mocktails or 0% beer - at this point I was like ‘F it I’ll drink’… but nope got Coca Cola & as they poured it I made sure they didn’t accidentally add a shot. 

… I didn’t drink! I simply got a free vape puff from someone & danced.

I still was ‘typical me’ when I go clubbing - elbowing creepy men who went too near my drunk friend, jumped around like a hooligan etc. 

I even saw my friends friend have a shot & screamed ‘Shot, shot, shot! 3,2,1 Ahhh’ 😂

It was quite funny at one point they said to the bar ‘We’ll have the same as her’ … didn’t twig it Coca Cola with no doubles or singles aha! Or that it was mysteriously cheap. 

My friend spent £100 I spent £11 (three coca colas).

The temptation was so high, but I’m so proud!! 

PS: One of my friends offered me to taste her drink & I sipped the tiniest amount (we’re talking performative sip olympics) DAMN but it wasn’t enough to get drunk & was literally a drop & I was like ‘nope’. 

I did sip it to look ‘normal’. I don’t think it breaks my sobriety because it would be 0.5% alcohol & there’s more alcohol in a banana. Plus my intent was ‘Sip the tiniest amount to look ‘normal’’ not I’m drinking this to drink. I’m drinking this to get the whole ‘She’s not drinking’ problem off my back lol NOT ‘This is my gateway, it’s only one sip’. 

One issue… Coca Cola gave me stomach pain & bloating, any alternative soft drink, if a bar does not do mocktails / 0.0% IPA? 

Another… how can I avoid more awkward situations? E.g. shots (they are harder to mask because I can’t ask for a shot of apple juice in front of everyone). ",1768053245.0,6,1,stopdrinking,substance

1q948fj,"I can’t stop, as I type this.","Sorry if this is too long, but I need to get this out to someone. Anyone!

I’ve been awake since 5am with a stomach ache and major anxiety. I can’t make myself stop for a day or two without wanting more. I have a sleeve under the bed in my office I’ve been working through the last day, and even tho I have an upset stomach, I added shots on-top of my tummy issue. I want to sleep, but I also know I’m doing myself no good here.

A bit of background; my ex (M 27) and I (M 27) broke up in early 2025. We were together for 2 and a half years, and knew each other since Kindergarten. Now I have no connection with him.

I was devastated, but have found a new guy (M 24) the past few months who has been absolutely fantastic and makes me feel a bit better about life. This post would be longer if I gushed about how awesome he is, but I’ll save it. He knows I “struggled” with alcohol, and it’s why my ex broke up with me. I wanted to be drunk all the time (mind you, I’m a happy drunk, I am never an asshole when I drink, thankfully). I just never knew when to stop.

I can’t stop drinking. No matter how good things are going.

I’m over my ex, to an extent (the financial burdens he left me with is the only thing that reminds me of him, I do not miss him anymore at this point), he was the one who really started amping up my drinking. We loved to get crossfaded together with cannabis/alcohol, but it seemed to take a bigger hold on me than it did him. I never liked drinking until we got together.

I do not blame my ex for my attraction to alcohol and its “solutions”, I fully take responsibility for spiraling with this crap.

I can’t stop drinking. I can’t. I get off work, and all I can think about is going to the gas station and downing 3-4 shots before getting home. I chew gum to mask the smell on my breath with the new guy I’ve been with. He isn’t stupid and I know he will figure it out eventually.

I have plenty of side hobbies (making/releasing music, collecting figures from movies I love, old video games, total nerding-out kind of hobbies lol), and I know what I’m doing is not good for me. Nothing fulfills me without that buzz.

I’m tired of taking shots. Hiding them somewhere; my car armrest, my desk, my office closet, things like that.

I feel helpless. I feel like I have no other way to cope. Im embarrassed of myself.

I don’t want to destroy the past 3 months with the new guy, over hiding my addiction and telling him I’ve been over it since my ex and I broke up.

The new guy smokes cannabis as much as I did before this crap started. I live in a legal state, have a spinal issue that allowed me to get a medical card in ‘21, and love what the products do for me. However, THC started to make me feel anxious/paranoid after I started drinking and the stress of life began creeping in heavily the past year. Thanks to him, I can consume and not have as much cravings while high. But yet, here I am, still trying to figure out what to do with myself, knowing this is not good for my health or social/romantic life.

What I’m really over, is myself.

1q931s2,60 days in from the best decision,"On November 10th 2025 I woke up so hungover I had to call off from my WFH job.

Since the end of a relationship last summer to that day, I'd been drinking almost daily. 

Pouring alcohol on top of anxiety,  grief, boredom, loneliness, and just the general stress of living in these times.

But it made every aspect of every awful thing worse.

I cut myself off from people to have more time to drink. I couldn't keep up on bills because the drinking/too lazy to cook/order delivery cycle was happening multiple times a week. I couldn't focus enough to engage in anything intellectually stimulating or creative. I wasn't processing anything that happened,  just ruminating and doomscrolling. And I felt so sick all the time. 

On November 10 I decided,  as I've heard around the rooms, to get busy living or get busy dying. 

It's very early. But I feel so much better now. I've reconnected with old friends and community. I've found new friends and community in recovery groups. My anxiety is just gone? I've been able to build and maintain meditation and exercise habits. I find I enjoy cooking again. I am able to face the adverse events in my life and the world with equanimity. 

I sleep well. And I want to get out of bed in the morning. 

I did slip and had 2 drinks the week of Thanksgiving, but I didn't even enjoy how they made me feel.

I am so early in recovery and life is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination,  but I am not actively making my life worse.

I am really grateful for this sub, for my old and new supportive community and friends, for the chance to wake up each day and have the choice to not drink.

1q92y42,That squirmy feeling of needing “something” is so uncomfortable.,"Maybe it’s the winter doldrums. Maybe it’s the “three-year-itch” (I mean, it could honestly be the any-year-itch). 

I go to my meetings and I bring it up. I talk to my sponsor about it. While those help, I usually get back home and just have to sit with the feeling again. 

It’s just that restless quiver inside. That little itch inside where I want *something*. Something outside of myself to affect me. Maybe to even change the way I feel, or alter me somehow. I feel like I’ve been metaphorically “taking sips” without drinking. Really letting this little humming desire eat me up inside. 

It’s such a sneaky uncomfortable feeling. It’s not even specifically about drinking. Even though I’ve been giving drinking the most serious amount of thought I ever have as a sober person. But it’s not an overbearing amount discomfort. It’s *just enough*. That’s what gets me. Just enough to sneak into my dreams. To sneak into every little part of my day. 

Today I looked back at pictures of me and my life of the year before I quit. And I felt really bad for that young man. I don’t look at those pictures fondly. On the surface, they’re all smiles and great memories. But I can’t believe that was me. I was unwell. 

Sometimes I’m pissed off at being an alcoholic. I suddenly feel a lack of acceptance about it. That quivering inside wants to defy the truth about myself. It wants to tell me “maybe you just need a little more pain, *just to be sure.*” Man, fuck that. 

Nothing outside of myself can give me what I want. Or even what I truly need. Just like alcohol, desire itself is also insidious. My desire is a lack of acceptance. Such an ugly feeling.

Just a quick history: family huge drinkers. I was an infantryman in Iraq ( I don’t blame it all on that but it clearly doesn’t help) I’m constantly at the gym or doing Jiu jitsu and hunting while sober. I draw, taught at university after Iraq, was a fire fighter, worked at a local bookstore. Generally when I’m not drinking life is beyond wonderful and I literally do thank God for the air in my lungs. 

  
What about alcohol has this grip on many of us that makes everything else seem dull, mundane and miserable?

  
I threw away a marriage due to alcohol with an absolutely wonderful woman. Several of my friends I was in Iraq with have taken their lives while intoxicated. I’ve tried AA and going to the VA and I swear the only thing I’ve found that removes the urge is attending mass regularly. I’m not preaching religion and have even had friends say “oh you’re using God as a crutch” and my response is I am absolutely using Christ as a crutch instead of a bottle. 

It seems that the everyday monotony of life is just so dull and repetitive to me that I lean into the bottle to ‘bend’ reality.

So tonight I waited up for when he got home after a date with his girlfriend. I asked him to sit at the dinner table with me. We talked about other stuff for a minute, and then I said I know a lot of H.S. kids drink, but he needs to know something. 

And then I told him a little about my childhood, and a little about why I figured out I had to stop drinking. And what I regret. And that I didn’t drink today and I’m not going to drink tomorrow and that he can ask me anything g and I’d try to be as honest as I can. 

He didn’t hate me, I didn’t cry, and he hugged me at the end. 

There was more to the conversation, but I told him and I don’t feel like shit. I did it. 

He’s such an amazing almost man person and I’m so incredibly lucky. 

So. I can’t make my words to him a lie.

1q8y4rx,"Am I sober or do I just not drink anymore? Either way, a year has passed.","Hi there,

On January 5th, 2025, I finally did it — I stopped drinking alcohol. Not for a week, not until the weekend, not until the next holiday or my birthday, or any other date I used to set as a limit (or as a “fresh start” to drink again). No more rules like “no hard alcohol,” “no drinking alone,” “just beer,” or “only one booze-filled day on a weekend.” Done.

I drank for nearly 20 years and finally stopped when I was 35. I never felt comfortable with myself. I was insecure, and when I discovered how alcohol made me feel — good, relaxed, confident — I fell in love with it. Nothing could stop me. I took every chance to drink. But once I started, I could never stop. One glass became one gulp, like someone lost in the Sahara finally finding water. Always. So every night was too much.

My drinking never sent me to the hospital, but it made me do bad things. My character changed, and I lost a lot of friends. When I was drunk, I didn’t care if the girl I liked was already someone else's (my friends) girlfriend. I became arrogant, reckless, and all my insecurities came out. No one wanted to spend time with me.

I dated many girls, made them like the version of me I showed them, and when things got serious, I ghosted them. I moved to the countryside and started drinking with neighbors — but most of the time, I drank alone.

A typical Friday: grocery shopping, a bottle of whiskey, and a “Kasten Bier” (that’s a crate of 20 half-liter bottles here in Europe). Two big packs of Marlboro, BBQ started, first beer. Second. Third. My girlfriend came home from work — we made whiskey coke. I finished mine in a minute, poured another, then another. She said, “You’re drinking fast today.” “It’s just my second one,” I lied. Another beer, so she wouldn’t notice. She went to bed; I stayed outside, drinking, smoking, listening to music until 2 a.m.

At 5 a.m., I woke up: heart racing, heartburn, no sleep. Did I call someone? No idea — I always deleted everything before bed. I took the dog out, feeling like shit, hoping not to meet anyone. Spent the day on the couch, shaking a bit when walking, regretting everything. Saturday evening: probably two or three beers again. Sunday: summer, so some wine (well, a bottle) at lunch. Or Aperol. Buzzed by 3 p.m., stopped at 4 because I had work on Monday. Work? Right. Those mornings, I went to the office praying not to get stopped by police.

During rough times at work, I drank four to seven beers almost every night just to calm down. Over time, I lost interest in any activity that didn’t include alcohol. Even when cycling on my exercise bike, I had two whiskey cokes (Zero ...) next to me. I couldn’t imagine eating out without drinking. Even at my godchild’s second birthday, I was the one who opened the fridge to grab beer first. On vacations, I was drunk every day.

After more than 10 years, I changed jobs. Better pay, a nicer company car, a big title. First day — I had a hangover and hoped no one would notice. I quit smoking. The result: I drank even more. I thought, “This can’t be right.” So I stopped drinking for four months. I was proud, told everyone. The new company was full of heavy drinkers, but I had no problem being the sober one.

The job turned out terrible, and I became depressed. After four months, my girlfriend and I went to a Brauhaus, and I thought it was the perfect time for a few “Altbier” and a pork knuckle. Three weeks later, I was fully back in the game.

Then I got sick — a serious motor nerve disease. I lost my job, went from hospital to hospital, and drank a lot. After medical treatments, I even googled whether it was okay to drink afterward. When my health improved, we went on vacation — I got so drunk the first night that the whole club knew me. We met some great people who later spent Christmas at our house. I bought a lot of alcohol — three bottles of liquor, two crates of beer, twelve bottles of wine, twelve bottles of mulled wine. Not all of it got finished, but I was prepared.

We had a great weekend, but when the new year started, I felt awful. My pain came back, I’d gained a lot of weight, stopped training, and felt completely empty. On January 5th, 2025, I was already hungover for the fourth time that year. Drinking alone at night until I was drunk — again — arguing with my girlfriend, telling her how much I hated my life.

That day, I finally admitted to myself that I couldn’t control my drinking — that I drank because I was unhappy and trying to bury my thoughts.

I told no one. The next days felt fine — like always after a hangover. But something was missing. I had nothing to look forward to. Drinking had been my only goal. So what now? How to celebrate, relax, fill time? What would I do with friends if I didn’t drink?

My close friends rarely drink, so I was always the one bringing alcohol and drinking most. At first, those situations were stressful — moments where I’d normally start drinking. But they passed. After 15, 30, maybe 60 minutes, the feeling was gone. And at the end of the night, lying in bed with my girlfriend, I thought: “That was a nice evening. Even without alcohol.”

In the early weeks, I often woke up in a panic: “What did I do last night? Did I drink?” Then I’d remember: “You idiot. You don’t drink anymore.” My godchild’s next birthday was great too. I could drive home, had good conversations, and discovered some lemonade I really liked. Bit by bit, I started enjoying things again — hiking without wine, dinners without booze, moments I’d forgotten.

The people I used to drink with? I haven’t seen them in a long time. And that’s fine.

Physically, I’m still struggling. I live with a chronic pain condition that affects my nervous system, and nobody can tell me if it will ever get better. My professional and financial future feels uncertain, and sometimes that thought alone can be heavy. But I know one thing for sure: drinking again would never make any of it better. It would only make everything worse — my health, my mind, my relationships, my hopes. I’m also getting married soon, and I know I can only keep my vows if I’m fully in control of myself — of what I do, what I say, and who I am. And that’s only possible when I’m sober.

So — am I sober? In German, we say trockener Alkoholiker — “dry alcoholic.” Or did I just stop drinking? It was easy for me to stop, but sometimes hard not to start again. I made a list in my head of what would happen if I “just had one.” One glass, then another, then a third. The next day I’d want one at lunch, waiting for the moment when it felt “okay” again to start drinking later that day.

I have to admit that I can’t control my alcohol consumption. That’s why I can never drink again — not even for pleasure.

And that’s why I will never drink alcohol again!

If you’ve read my story all the way to the end — thank you. I really enjoy reading all the stories here and feel genuinely happy for everyone who has found a new version of themselves.

1q8xk79,50 days in,"I'm officially 50 days sober.

I have so much to say about how I got to this point in my life, what the past 8 weeks have been like, and the actual event that led to the decision to stop drinking. But I want to save a lot of that for another day.

All I know is that without a shadow of a doubt, alcohol has waged a war on my soul for the past 15 years in ways I still don't fully understand. I'm not saying that I can point to drinking as the source of all my problems, but I am saying that I no longer viewed a lot of my problems as such because of drinking. And the problems it *would* create were ""solved"" by the thing itself, creating a vicious cycle of apathy. Apathy of the body and mind. One in the same.

Dream killer. Liver flayer. Relationship ender. Memory stealer. Job obliterator. Injury maker. Light taker. I'm done. No more half-measures. I give myself all the grace in the world to acknowledge how I ended up here but I'll be damned if I waste one more day choosing a black hole over life.

I'm only 50 days in. A lot of strange feelings are coming up. But I am optimistic. Not a day goes by that my body doesn't wonder where our old friend has gone, or my mind doesn't play visions of cheap beer ads on an infinite loop. It's bizarre. I've always known I've had a problem but I didn't expect to have such a visceral reaction to removing alcohol from the equation.

The word ""alcoholic"" still intimidates me. Right now it feels more comfortable to simply say I have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol to the point where the drawbacks outweigh the positives 100 to 1. That 1 kept me hanging on for so long. That 1 cost me a lot. That 1 was a lie. Was I having fun or was I just having a diluted version of hierarchical needs being met? What needs did drinking meet that I couldn't have gotten without it?

Maybe this has something to do with my new path, maybe it doesn't. But today I laughed and really felt it in my chest. It came easy. It sort of tickled. I haven't laughed like that in a long time.

I bid farewell to the monkey on my back, just for today. I'm not thinking about a few months from now, a few years from now, or even a few decades from now. I'm thinking about how there's a damn monkey on my back! Get this thing off me!

1q8wfdu,I Don’t F’ing Hate Myself,"DAY 100

Journal time. Mid forties married father. Outwardly I “have it all figured out,” but my nearly daily drinking was really starting to hurt everything in my life. I just hit day 100. Not a drop, except the one time I accidentally took a sip of someone’s IPA instead of my NA. I hadn’t planned for that situation, but I went to the bathroom and spit it out.

There have been so many moments where I started to justify “just one.” Then I remember that one is just enough to make ten feel reasonable. Every morning I wake up genuinely glad I didn’t drink the day before.

The biggest change by far is that I don’t feel shame and loathing when I look in the mirror anymore. Early on, after one of my many failed attempts, I remember posting that I “fucking hate myself.” I hated knowing I was pissing my kids’ childhoods away. I hated knowing they would remember my booze breath. I hated being hungover around them and showing up as a watered down version of myself.

That self loathing is gone. That’s the best part of this so far.

I may have inspired at least one friend to quit. He randomly reached out and told me he was on day 20. That meant more to me than I expected.

I’ve also learned that people really don’t care that I don’t drink.

The physical stuff has been nice too. I’ve lost weight. My skin looks better. Smoother, less puffy, spider veins way reduced. I’m sleeping better. I stayed healthy through the holidays, which never happens.

One side effect is that I absolutely hate being around people who are hammered now. They smell. They repeat the same dumb punchlines. They’re boring. They’re gross.

While I don’t hate myself anymore and I’m actually proud of myself, I’m not yet much happier. Most evenings I’m still just counting the hours until I can go to sleep. I’m guessing that part comes later.

Going in for updated labs soon and I’m looking forward to seeing some progress.

Grateful for you all.

What inevitably happens is that I experience the initial excitement of the first few sips and then get distracted and consumed by getting drunk. Sure, I can watch a movie but I rarely remember them, the project gets put off, the garage remains a shambles.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**  Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink.* It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**  A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:**  A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good Morning and Happy Saturday!

Let’s talk Self Care.  

For me, sleep is my number one form of self care.  When I’m well rested - most everything else is better.  I never realized how sleep deprived I was when I was drinking.  Even staying up late now can remind me of a hangover and ain’t nobody got time for that.  I do apologize for all the early posts for the check in this week, but I go to sleep early! ☺️

Physical activity is a form of self care that I lean into as well.  My dog especially likes it because we take a lot of walks.  Remember - rest is also self care!  You don’t need to earn it and you don’t need permission.  I hope you’re doing something this weekend that makes yourself feel cared for.

What’s your favorite form of self care?

Are you doing anything special this weekend you’d like to share?

Thank you so much for allowing me to be your host this week!  I hope 2026 is an amazing year for all of us!

I've been drinking a bottle or two of wine for the past 10 years and I feel the toll it's taken on my health. I feel sluggish and tired all the time, however much I sleep I never feel properly rested so I sleep away my days off. The only time I feel I have any energy is when I crack open my first bottle at 6pm, then I'm sociable energetic and ""fun"" until I wake in the morning and can barely drag myself out of bed, I'm moody, exhausted and ill and then the cycle continues.

I've been trying to deal with this chronic fatigue by changing my diet, taking supplements, etc but I know as long as I keep drinking all my efforts are wasted. I feel so embarrassed and pathetic for not being able to get out of this cycle.


I live alone in a foreign country and I often get hit by loneliness and boredom in the evenings and meeting new people seems to always centre around alcohol. I don't feel much interest in socialising unless alcohol is involved since I think I'll just be tired and boring without it.

I hate it.

I'm super irritable, every little thing pisses me off. I'm doing a good job at coping with it and staying calm and everything, but internally it feels like EVERYTHING is a trigger. It's insane.

Avoiding this feeling is most likely why I started drinking heavily during grad school way back then and also why I've had such a hard time stopping.

I know that long term my stress and anxiety will improve, but would love to hear some anecdotes because it feels like the world is falling in on me (now I know why this is even a phrase, it literally feels like I'm being crushed).

Staying sober has come with a huge wave of self realization and it's been really motivating me to start building a structure around me that helps me thrive, I'm starting to obsess about improving myself and I need to give myself a little bit of slack.

Recently my new job was miserable and I quit. Proceeding that I drank for a few days straight. My husband was worried. I stopped for a month and focused on me and family tragedy hit. So I drank for 2 days straight. 

This past week he *strongly* encouraged me to enter a program despite my lack of religious beliefs. His therapist recommended a great spot. My therapist also gave it her thumbs up. 

The facility is fine. Staff are nice. But I cannot relate to a single person in treatment. I suffer from isolation and I have virtually no family. So my biggest thing was connection. 

I feel worse and more anxious than I ever have after having to pray, work steps and listen to stories that are more about drugs and jail. I understand the folks in the program need it. But I feel more lost. 

Also being told that all these people and the workers have never completed the program without relapse is depressing. Everyone says its like oh, the success rate is low unless you do EVERYTHING to a T.

Quitting for me involved heavily substituting with simple carbs and junk, as soon as I experienced any minor inconvenience I was elbow deep in a family pack of chippies or eating chocolate like my life depended on it.

In that time I learned how to socialise sober, go to gigs sober, hang out with my drinking friends and be alone with myself but I needed the self destructive (less than my previous habits) crutch of something to take the edge off or a dopamine hit.

I am finally eating well, am regulating habits with exercise and am able to sit with myself and not feel the need for constant distraction.

I’m sharing this for those who feel like sobriety isn’t as good as they expected and life still feels hard.

1q8qys4,Dry Januaryists Day 9 - The fog has lifted,"\# I’m happy to report that for me, the fog has finally lifted.

To be completely honest with you all, I have been in a real funk this week. I’ve spent the last few days essentially white-knuckling my way through. I didn't have much ""inspiration"" to give; I was just hanging on, doing what needed to be done, and trying to give myself the space and time to feel low without making it worse. I stayed kind to myself because I’ve learned that, eventually, it always passes.

I wanted to share that committing to writing these posts every day has helped me enormously. Reading the replies from people who have resonated with these thoughts has been a huge boost when I needed it most. So thank you to this community.

One of the greatest gifts of my sobriety has been the ability to be \*\*present\*\* in my life. I am in touch with my emotions now, rather than being beholden to them. When these ""dark days"" arrive, I’ve noticed they are far less frequent, less deep, and much shorter than they were during my drinking days.

I’m not sure if that’s a direct result of not having the depressant effects of alcohol in my system, or a result of the other life changes I’ve made since quitting—most likely, it’s a combination of both.

If you are in a funk today, or if you are white-knuckling your way through Day 10: hang in there. It passes. You are doing the work, and the clarity is waiting for you on the other side.

I made it through the holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's Eve, actually pretty easily. I don't get much cravings anymore, they come once in awhile and they come strong. 

I have recently been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, when I say recently I mean within the last year and a half, although I've probably have had it for about 20 years. For those of you that have struggled with or know someone that has major depressive disorder, they don't always look sad but for me it shows up as a cycle, sometimes I'm fine and sometimes I'm really low.

Right now, I am really low. It sucks because most of the time I can deal with it with techniques that I've worked on with my therapist, and my combination of my medications.

1q8p5fo,Feeling trapped: When do all these benefits kick in?,"I’m 20 days sober today after over a year of daily drinking. What finally made me quit is that I decided I wanted to be more present in my life. I saw people talking all the time about how quitting increased their performance at work, improved their mood, reduced anxiety/depression, and decreased temper issues. The withdrawal wasn’t so bad, and I’ve done that before, but the cravings are so impossible right now. All I think about from the time I get off work until the time I go to bed is going out to buy beer. It’s so hard, and it feels like I’m not seeing all this positive change that I thought I would. 

I’ve always had issues with anxiety, long before ever drinking, and drinking was that thing that really made me feel in control of my anxiety and depression. Now, my anxiety just builds all day and paralyzes me in the evening. I’m scared I’ll crack and drink again, wasting all my hard work. I’m anxious about going out, because all my relationships outside of work involved alcohol in some way. I’m scared of letting down my friends and family, because after I’ve opens up about my struggles I’ll seem like a failure if I relapse. 

My work doesn’t seem to be improving, and actually it feels like I can’t let go of my stress at the end of the day. I lose sleep, tossing and turning, thinking about work and what I need to do. I feel exhausted during the day, and have trouble even keeping my eyes open during my plan period (I’m a teacher). 

I’ve taken antidepressants for years, before drinking, and have taken them consistently while drinking. (Effexor/venlafaxine. I know it’s bad. I told myself it would be fine because I took it in the morning and only drank at night). I haven’t felt truly depressed in years, but now it seems like those feelings are coming back. Did I ruin my tolerance to the meds? Will I just get worse?

Is it just the addiction talking? Do I just have to wait it out? Why does it seem like everyone else hits a few weeks of sobriety and their life just immediately changes for the better, but mine is basically the same if not worse?

I knew I was having a dream and couldn’t put my finger on it; I just knew I did NOT want to go back to sleep and fall back into it.  It wasn’t until I was fully awake that I realized I was dreaming about throwing back shot after shot of whiskey.  I might be reading too much into it but I think my “nope not going back to sleep” reaction was my mind saying “absolutely not. We don’t do that anymore”.  Instead of going back to bed, I extended my morning coffee quiet time, did some chores, and spent an hour or so reading through posts on here then went about my day without even looking at hubby’s bottle of whiskey and thinking “weeeeelllll maybe”.  Then later at work, we had a celebration for the owners: every person over 21 today got a complimentary glass of bubbles to celebrate with them.  I finished my shift, cheers-ed regulars, coworkers, and friends with my Guinness 0, and came home to walk the dog.  For today, on both counts, I consider this Friday a win.

1q8p151,Struggling a bit,"Hi, ive been lurking for a while and this is my first post here. I don't know if I would ever say that I ever was an alcoholic, the label isnt really important, but a short backstory before I go on;   
  
About a month ago I messed up, again. I go to university, and I used to go out with my friends and have fun drinking. I had a habit of going a bit too overboard, my upbringing wasnt easy and I never really had a social life until recently where I could learn my limits with drinking. I've never been used to going out drinking, and I believe that this is a big reason why I keep messing up maybe? This entire situation lead to my friends being put in a unfortunate situation of needing to help me get home, which is emberrasing for both parties. Its happened a couple of times, and this lead to them giving me the silent treatment after the last time. This really hit my mental hard, as I have trauma related to that (which they knew), and they used it to teach me a lesson, leaving me spiraling mentally to a really dark place for a couple of days. We made up though, I understand their perspective, but im also not happy with how they went about dealing with the situation in hindsight.

This brings me to the topic at hand too, tomorrow they're going out, they want me to come with, but sober. I already went out with them once after that ordeal sober, which was not a problem, but it was unbelievably boring to me. I feel like they already labeled me, and they are removing my autonomy and not giving me a chance to prove that ive learnt my lesson. It makes me really sad, because i feel like im missing out on a very important part of being in uni, which is socializing. I do socialize when im sober too, but I feel like going out with them with a few drinks is important, and im scared that if I just don't drink with them that they will eventually just disappear from my life and I'll go back to being alone again like I was for many years.

1q8oedu,"First 'night out' sober, my insights.","Dry january warrior (who would love to continue sobriety afterwards) here! Tonight I went for drinks with my friends, and we ended up in a bar with pretty heavy drinking. More of our mutuals joined in, all drunk and ready to go clubbing after.

Two of my friends were drinking like normally, me and my best friend were drinking NA beers (and I had a little NA gin-tonic hehe). Now it's 12:45am and I have my insights and thoughts!

1. I HAD FUN. I don't need alcohol to socialize, dance or have fun.
2. Drunk people get really in your face and don't realize the concept of personal space, and it annoyed me. Even when it was my friend who I normally adore and don't feel weird with being close to.
3. Nothing good happens after like.. 11. I did not feel the need to stay out until later and later to seek more fun.
4. I am a /casual/ smoker (well.. smoke everywhere except for at home weirdly enough) and I felt less inclined to smoke every 15 minutes. The alcohol really adds onto the craving.
5. I am now in bed, without feeling like needing to eat greasy food and drinking a liter of water to prevent a hangover. I feel clean. I feel like I will have a nice sleep. I took my makeup off and brushed my teeth like I would do any normal night. When drunk I would either skip or do it half.

Lastly, I am so tired. Normally I would go out until 5am or even later, end up at an afterparty after having ''casual drinks'' at 7pm. I'm gonna sleep in my own bed. Life is good. IWNDWYT. <3",1768002522.0,31,1,stopdrinking,substance

1q8o81s,I had 58 days sober and my wife came out to me. Today is day 59. AMA.,"My entire life shifted under me 24 hours ago and somehow I'm still sober. I'm hoping that somewhere in this thread I'll start to have an inkling how that's happened.

I've been a daily drinker for the last fifteen years, but the last six have been particularly hard. My wife and I took pay cuts to move 200 miles away to a place we thought we could afford to build a better life for ourselves - five weeks later the pandemic lockdowns started. I started drinking more. We managed to buy a home in 2021 and six months later, my wife lost her mother to cancer. She lost her aunt to the same six months after that. I started drinking more.  A miscarriage in 2022, followed by the realization that we were never going to be parents. I started drinking more.

She had been out as bisexual for a few years by then and after so much pain I was determined to try and bring more joy into her life, to do anything I could so that she could be more fully herself. We tried polyamory. We tried ethical non-monogamy. She met a woman she fell head over heels for and nine months later, she broke things off completely because of the lies she'd been told and how poorly I'd been treated. I was drinking much, much more by then. I remember how much of that summer I spent alone in our home, wondering what had happened to us. I remember how large a queen size bed felt when I was sleeping alone. I don't remember too much else.

Afterwards we tried therapy, we tried couples therapy, and we tried couples therapy again. By this point I was going through a handle of 100 proof bourbon every 48 hours and I genuinely believed that since I could stop for a day or three or five and tend to whatever business I needed to it wasn't really a problem. She prefers cannabis, I prefer liquor, nobody's judging anybody and as long as everything's fine, then everything's fine.

58 days ago, she asked me to stop. Not for a week, not for two, but to *stop.* Ninety days, at least, and then see where my head was at. She told me that it felt like I loved drinking more than I loved her, that she could not stand to see me making myself so small, that as confused as she was about everything that's happened she couldn't find a way to desire me when I was so dedicated to dulling my senses, that whatever we were going through could not possibly be helped by incrementally poisoning myself.

She said that it was only because she knew what kind of man I was and could be that she was having this conversation with me instead of a lawyer.

That one sentence sobered my simple ass up right quick. Everything out of the house that night, cold turkey then and there. Yes, I know, that's *very* stupid, but in my defense, so am I.

I've been lucky so far in that regard. No physical withdrawal symptoms, no sleep disturbance, no mood swings, no anxiety spikes. My bloodwork shows no abnormalities at all. My therapist told me a few days ago that she's been doing substance abuse recovery work since the mid nineties and she's absolutely certain I don't have an alcohol problem (which is a whole different story that I'm not sure would be helpful here - I'll say that there came a time that I decided to become a functional alcoholic and we'll leave it at that. Like I said earlier, *very* stupid, but so am I!)

I was starting to feel like I'd actually gotten away with it. That I didn't have to hit rock bottom, that my life didn't need to be rebuilt from the ground up at the age of 41. Okay, yeah, my job is absolutely ending on 4/30 and yeah, there's no relevant work where I live and yeah, the amount of debt we're carrying could crush us at any moment, but you know what? I got sober on COMMAND, my guys! I have the constitution of an ox and I can probably leap tall buildings in a single bound if I really tried hard, am I right? Willpower and discipline and the impossibly loving support of my wife, who -

Is gay.

Yes, she's sure. No, nothing was faked. Nothing was forced. She wishes it wasn't the case. She's sure. She loves me. She's always loved me. She wishes more than anything that the person who helped her build a life where she could finally be who she is wasn't the one this will hurt to the core. Yes, she's sure.

She doesn't want to leave. She doesn't want a divorce. She loves me and she's proud of what I've done and she's proud of what we've built and she's sure. She swears that one day she's going to be the best wingman anybody ever had, she's going to make sure every woman I ever look at twice knows what she'd be passing up and she is god-damn *sure.*

Everything I've done for the last decade of my life I've done so that one day she could feel safe enough to be all of who she is, whatever that might mean. I gave my word, and while I never dreamt that this might be what it takes to keep it, well, that's really too bad, because I gave my fucking word. When and if there comes a day there's a woman she wants to marry instead, I will send my fifty dollars to the universal life church and I will perform that ceremony myself and I will never do anything harder than that because even through a drunken haze a decade long I delivered what I promised and she is absolutely, positively sure.

And that brings me, somehow, to day 59. I've read this back over twice and I don't see what could've been different any more than I see how I'm going to make it to day 60. But there's not a drop of alcohol in the house, I'm making another cup of tea, and if I can stand to sit in the ash and dust of my life for another handful of hours, I'll get to do the very same thing tomorrow. And the day after that, and the day after *that...*

Maybe it's a stupid way to look at things but, well, y'know.

===============================================

EDIT 1.10.2026, 12:43PM EST:

I am decidedly and dramatically unprepared for the response this thing has gotten, y'all, god-DAMN. I don't know how to appropriately return the support I've gotten here today. Thank each and every one of you, truly.

Given the visibility this has right now, there's one thing in particular I feel compelled to make very clear: in *absolutely no way* does this constitute a lie or a betrayal of any kind on the part of my wife as far as I'm concerned. I have said yes to *every single step* that led us to today. In fact, I've been the one to push us onward on occasion when she was afraid of what all of this could mean for us.

When she first came out to me, I gave her my word that if there ever came a time she felt she needed to explore herself in this fashion, she would do so with my knowledge and consent, whatever that might mean. I told her that I couldn't bring myself to ask her to keep herself small or stunted or in any way less than the fullness of who she is just because she happened to be marrying a man. And when we were married, we wrote our own vows and I swore that I would always lift her towards the light, whatever that might cost.

I very deliberately did not say a single word about fidelity.

The first sentence she ever said to me was ""Fuck you, you're wrong."" I love that this is how she introduced herself into my life just as much as I love her. That energy has propelled us forward at times I couldn't have seen a way through on my own. That energy inspired this post just like it has 60 days of sobriety. And if one day still to come we should crash and burn despite our lofty dreams and best intentions, well, hey.

1q8ndc0,"Day 10 - so far, so good with minor speed wobbles","Hello team! I'm sitting with my thoughts and thought I'd put some of them down, in part so that I can look back on them as time goes on.

- I had a bit of a cheat start with a frankly chaotic bout of gastro. So my first weekend didn't really 'count' I guess - but I'll take any advantage i can!

- within days my face was less puffy and my eyes looked brighter. I'm incredibly critical of my appearance so for me to see a difference is quite something - other people definitely will be too. That's motivating! I know that makes me sound a bit vain but again - motivation is an advantage so I'll take it!

- have i been tempted to have just one a couple of times? Yep! There's been some speed wobbles. But each time I've had a speed wobble I've put my thinking brain back in charge, not my instant-gratification brain. I 'just' need to keep doing that.

- I'm so incredibly grateful for the people around me. I haven't even told people that I've stopped drinking, so they don't know to be supportive. But they're still being so supportive just because they're lovely - no questions, no pressure to drink. On the one hand I'm very lucky, but on the other hand I'm part of my friend group too - together we've built a lovely vibe.

- I'm on my own this weekend at home. Last night (Friday night) felt easy. Tonight feels very doable too - I have coke zero in the fridge, I have things I want to watch on telly, and then I'll have an excellent sleep and will wake up fresh on Sunday. That looks very different to previous weekends home alone!

- I know that this is likely the pink cloud or whatever it's called. I know that it'll get waaaaaaay harder. But I'll ride this positivity for as long as I need to, and build some of those willpower muscles. And then when the time comes I'll remind myself that I can do hard things! I don't have to enjoy them, but I can do them.

1q8mux6,4 weeks,"It's been 28 days since I had my last drink, it was a full blown alcohol induced blackout, here are the changes I noticed

Sleep in the first 3 days were absolute torture, I could probably sleep 4 hours daily and go the rest of the day like a zombie and at night roll around in bed until barely fall asleep at almost daylight for another 4 hours and repeat. Now almost a month later I could fall asleep somewhat normally again, although my body clock is still messed up, and I still have trouble sleep pass 7 hours a day.

Brain fog in the first 3 weeks were so bad I basically lost my capacity to think or initiate any social interaction. Sure I could engage in a conversation but there was always a wall in my head that blocked me, and is still blocking me albeit lesser so to come up with new topics for conversations and new ideas, for me to be the one who initiates rather than passively responding. Now it improved slightly but I still have trouble puting my idea into words even if I could form them in my head.

No energy: I feel more energized and clearheaded in the morning when I first got up, but that little energy is quickly drained around 2pm, I would be so tired with a foggy mind for the rest of the day and lose all capability to think and just want to get the day over with and go to bed. 4 weeks in I can stay sharp for a little longer, maybe to around 3-4pm, then fatigue and brain fog again.

Headache has gotten slightly better, I drank plenty of water but it doesn't seem to help, for the first 2 weeks the headache felt like something was pinching my brain from within, paired with the constant brain fog even reading became a luxury. Now I still have headaches daily but it became slightly more tolerable. Since water doesn't seem to help I think I can only ride this out with time.

For more than half of the nights since I gone sober I was plagued by some kind of bad dreams, sometimes it's straight up nightmare being chased by demons that looked as if it came straight out of a Lovecraftian book, sometimes by humanoid figures that looked human but there are something terrifyingly creepy about them, I could fly in those dreams but those entities always flied faster than me even at full speed like they were toying with me, it was sheer horror and desperation; other dreams were eerie but not quite terrifying, most of them were fragmented, with little pieces here and there so I couldn't quite piece together what I just dreamed, but one thing I do remember they were all in realms without sunlight, some were grey and some looked like dark forests, some in abandoned schools that were suddenly filled with people... like I wouldn't be surprised if you tell me I've been briefly pulled into the afterlife in those dreams. But regardless dreams of demons or some grey purgatory, the common theme all these dreams had was hopelessness, I'm stuck there for eternity with no way out.

But even I'm going through these problems, headaches, brain fogs, insomnia ,dreams of demonic worlds, I have faith that it will all pass. I've been drinking heavily for over 4 years, the damage has been done and the healing will take much longer than a month I'm sure. So I made the bed and now I have to sleep in it.

I'll probably make an update in another post that's more coherent once I'm in a better mental state, right now the brain fog hasn't completely lifted yet which you could surely see from my writings of my poor mental performance.",1767998708.0,9,3,stopdrinking,substance

Over time, though, that part of me kept growing until it started crowding out other parts of who I am.

Now there’s this empty space, and it feels a lot like grief. But I’m starting to wonder if that space isn’t something to fix. Maybe it’s room. Room for the other parts of me, the husband, the father, the runner, the friend, the bandmate, the leader.

I’m a runner, so I’ve learned that being uncomfortable isn’t always a bad thing. Sometimes it’s necessary. Sometimes it’s how we get stronger if we can sit with it long enough.

I know I have a problem with alcohol. Whenever things aren’t going well, I feel the urge to drink, and often I do. Always alone, obviously, sometimes even to the point of making myself vomit.

I’ve already had an alcoholic coma where my blood alcohol level was around 4–5 g/L. The doctors thought I was trying to kill myself, when in reality I just drank like crazy…

I can’t drink hard liquor anymore because of that, and honestly, that’s probably a good thing. But other types of alcohol, I still drink them when things aren’t going well…

I know this is alcoholic behavior, and I’m not in denial—I’m aware of my problem. I would really like to get out of it, but even with my therapist, I don’t dare talk about it.

So I’m wondering how former alcoholics managed to get out of it. Even when I’ve stopped for a long time, I relapse every time. I’m honestly ashamed of it.

I feel like I’ll never get out of it and that it’s a vicious circle.

If you have any tips to help me, I’ll take them—I’m clearly desperate…

A few months ago I went through the worst withdrawal of my life, coming off years of almost a liter of vodka a day cold turkey. Ended up having to go to the ER and get some seizure prevention drug. But the scariest part of it was for the first 48 hours of being off, I was stuck in these time loops.

Basically I would relive the same 2-3 minutes dozens of times, and then move on to the next 2-3 minutes and it would do the same. At the peak for a couple hours it actually felt like multiple days had passed of repeating the same moments over and over again.

I'm sure it was just fucking with my short term memory or extreme de ja vu x 1000 but I would go through the motions and I would be like I've already done this like 6 times and then would reset back to where it started and do the same things again.

I spent the last month reading this subreddit because I had a suspicion that my drinking was getting out of my control, and asking chatgpt things like ""how do I know if I have a drinking problem"".  I would read some of the stories on here and think ""wow i'm glad I never let it get that bad"".

  
I decided I actually don't care if I have a problem yet or not, because regardless of the current answer, I know that I was on a path to a problem eventually.  I started dry January late on 1/4, after reading some of the stories here.  I dumped out almost $200 of whiskey knowing I would fold eventually if I kept it.

Last night my daughter asked me at 8:00pm if we could run to the store for something she needed for school.  If this had been the week before, I would have been at least 4 drinks deep by that time. I would have gotten frustrated and told her it was too late, that she should have thought of it earlier, or perhaps doordashed it to our house paying an insane fee for the privilege.  Instead, sober me smiled and grabbed my keys and said ""Let's get ice cream on the way"".

Later that night, she came into my room at 2am to tell me she was having trouble sleeping because she was sad about being teased at school.  If this had been last week, I would have been annoyed at being woken up, told her we would talk about it in the morning and to try her best to sleep.  Instead, sober me got up and sat with her for 30 minutes, talking about what happened, reassuring and loving her, and putting together a plan for how we'll handle the situation.

When we finally finished, she hugged me for much longer than our normal hug, and said ""Thank you Dad"" and turned over.  When I checked on her 10 minutes later she was dead asleep.

I'm so thankful for that opportunity I would have never had if I were still drinking.  This, more than anything, has assured me that I did/do have a problem, and I'm excited to see what opportunities the next few weeks will bring.

God knows what I did or said in the hours I was at the event blacked out. I don’t even want to know.

I’ve been aware I have a problem since I started drinking at 18. But this was genuinely rock bottom. Especially because it was so hard to find this job after being laid off earlier this year. Before, I’d been able to keep my work and drinking separate (excluding being constantly hungover at work or calling out sick due to hangovers) and this felt like a new line I crossed that I don’t know how to come back from.

I wasn’t fired or anything, but everyone certainly has a different opinion of me now vs before and it’s palpable. I made an excuse about being on a new medication but not sure if anyone actually bought it. Seem to be generally on thin ice with everyone.

Waking up that next morning, I knew that there were only 2 options - get sober or end my life. because I knew if I kept drinking this wouldn’t be the last time I’d have to feel such unbearable shame (have had endless embarrassing incidents in the past in a variety of situations). So I knew I had to get sober if I didnt want to break my family’s hearts by ending my life altogether.

I do feel much better and the main thing that’s making me hopeful is knowing I never have to put myself in any kind of compromising situation or be out of control of my behavior ever again. Also not to brag (but also to brag) I look amazing (clear skin finally, -5 lbs, in case anyone needs any extra motivation, LOL!)

I feel generally positive about my life moving forward and believe in myself to stick with this and do what’s actually best for my mental health and wellbeing. This wasn’t my first hospitalization due to alcohol… and I’m only 24. It was just the first one at work 😭

The issue is having to be at this job everyday in a confined office space, around coworkers who’ve seen me at my absolute worst. My boss seems to have moved past it and we have a positive relationship. But I hate that I can’t scream to everyone “I know I had a problem, but I’m sober now, I’m better now, I’m not that embarrassing version of myself” but that’s obviously not appropriate or necessary. I just wish they didn’t think I was still walking around as that sad broken out of control  version of myself.

I know as time passes people forget and move on, but it’s a terrible reminder coming in every day that all of these people were there for my rock bottom without any context as to my struggles or level of self-awareness. I’m scared they just see me as a young blonde party girl who doesn’t know her limits or take her work seriously or care about the repercussions of her actions. I know that’s not me- I do care, and I care a lot. I care about others, being kind, showing up in a positive way in the world. I just wasn’t always able to do those things because I’ve been captured by this disease my entire adult life.

It never felt like I was actively making bad choices, but rather like I was simply reacting to impulses that I had to drink excessively in order to cope with life. It felt like there was no other way.

I know now that I do have a choice, but I just wish everyone knew my entire struggle and how deeply I regret and feel shame about this incident. I know that’s not how life works and as they say perception is reality. I guess that just makes me feel uneasy and upset. I hate the feeling of being misunderstood. Not to mention, beyond this incident, there are hundreds of other people walking around the world who have some other terrible image/memory of who I am that isn’t the real me. And it’s just frustrating. I’m sure many of us feel this way.

I guess I don’t have a question. Just needed to share this with someone. Have really appreciated this community over my past 35 days of sobriety. Thank you!!!

I didn’t have a problem until Covid, when the bleakness of the world led me to normalise drinking most days of the week. Before that I naively didn’t understand how anyone could have a problem with alcohol. 

I’m not usually a huge drinker in terms of volume, (I probably average 1-1.5 bottles of wine) but left to my own devices I’m drinking that 5-7 nights a week.

If I don’t change then I’m going to continue wasting a lot of my life and probably end up escalating to worse and more risky drinking and behaviour, as all addictions tend to do.

It’s not going to be easy at times, I have had a propensity to drink when I feel negative about the world or the news when things are feeling chaotic, but I need to prioritise myself in order to change.

But today. A low key Friday. Dinner and movie with some girlfriends. A couple cocktails. Sounds good. Sounds easy and “if I only had a couple it wouldn’t be a problem”.

But then I remind myself- it’s NEVER a couple. A few drinks with friends turns into grabbing a pint on the way home which turns into taking shots of triple sec because it’s the only beverage with alcohol content left in the house.

So I won’t be having just a couple today. I guess I never had just a couple in my entire life.

That night I ended up checking myself into the hospital, I couldn't sleep once again and everything got to be too much. Hearing voices in the fridge motor sounds, anxiety still through the roof, still shaking, so I called a cab and got myself to the hospital. Once I got there I started seeing patterns moving around on the floor, what appeared to be bugs moving but not actually getting anywhere, ants on the ceiling ect

I'm glad I did, the nurses and doctors were great, gave me benzos to help, finally got some sleep. Addiction specialists came and talked to me, I'll be going on Campral and getting some valium to take home to help ease me through the trail end of the withdrawals, and will even be setting me up with councilling.

Tomorrow I'll be going to a meeting, and I'll actually take those steps seriously this time.

Maybe the alcohol gave me enough dgaf to where I didn't realize I wasn't killing it as much as I had hoped which definitely wasn't a good thing. 

I have a few personal relationships that are strained and combined with my professional stress it's all screaming at me to have a few drinks to numb it and deal with it later. The one thing I tell myself every time I pass the liquor store is ""it's only gonna make it worse"" and so far, that has helped a ton. 

I'm down 10 pounds which is a major positive, in the gym daily and over pretty much all of the digestive issues getting off of booze solved for me. I've tried the ""Cali sober"" method a few times but it just hasn't hit the spot for me so trying to still figure out how to take the edge off of days like this without it leading to a blackout or regret.

Over the past few years that has devolved into daily drinking. Beers to start, then vodka mixed drinks, and over the last year 2-3 beers and 5-7 fireball shooters basically every single night. Obviously, a problem but never missed work, coached my kids sports teams, never drove, and was never an angry drunk.

I am “California sober” currently and it’s been pretty mild. My main issue stems around either ADHD (not diagnosed) or anxiety or a combination of the two. Drinking was a pretty great way to “calm” my brain and the internal monologue. Any small mistake at work or perceived failure will paralyze me for the rest of the night.

Until COVID I was a fairly moderate drinker, maybe somewhat of a binge drinker. The last 6 years I’ve seen myself devolve into undeniable alcoholism. Hanging at my local dive bar 5-6 days a week. Drinking every night. Feeling like shit at work every day. I couldn’t make it more than 2 days without drinking. Constantly anxious, high BP, stomach issues, body getting soft (I’ve always been lean and athletic), my body was just telling me it was time. I went on a big bender in early December and just decided enough was enough. 3 days before my birthday I decided I was done. Today I’m 31 days sober. Been feeling all of the highs and lows that come with early sobriety as expected. The holidays, my birthday, new years, and two deaths in my family in that timespan were all huge challenges that made me consider drinking, but I made it through without.. I work in the trades, and have been laid off for the last 2 months, which gave me plenty of fuel to feed into my alcoholism. Unemployment has barely been covering basic expenses, and finances have been a huge stessor. I didn’t know how I was going to continue paying for school that started this week. I’m 3/4 years in to an apprenticeship, and without school - I’m out of my line of work completely. At the last second I was able to miraculously obtain a grant through my college to pay my tuition this term. Then my old company called me last week. They want me to come back starting Monday.

But anyways, my options is either my sad slow boring life or no life at all, which i tried for a long time, and is actually worse by a lot. So i hope some of you will excuse my gloomy mood, and most of you will not drink with me tonight. ",1767977345.0,8,1,stopdrinking,substance

Im new here and I am really just seeking comfort and reassurance with this and I have no one to talk to. But I heard this subreddit (if I said that correctly) is the place to go and vent to ..

Background - 29 yo female . Been smoking and drinking since I saw my moms last breath when I was 21. Both are terrible habits but I will focus on the drinking being that that's what this subreddit is for... The drinking started off slowly then got worse when I lost my home shortly after. Then it became an every night thing. The kind of drink varied but it's always been liquor (nips in specific). To top it off I have bad anxiety and health anxiety and as we know, even though we think drinking helps short term, long term it makes everything worse. Well, approaching 10 years I now drink every night. I don't wake up and drink, but I do it in the evenings. And I want to stop. I wanted 2026 to be a year of growth, change, and healing. But I'm struggling. My anxieties been out of control and whenever I wake up saying I will not drink tonight, I still end up drinking. I don't wake up with the hangovers, but more the hangxiety. Im trying very hard to be strong. I been trying to ""find a day"" that would be good to start my journey but I think its best that day finds me and I want it to be today. However, I'm scared. Like I said I have anxiety/health anxiety. I would like to have a good week sober and then order some lab work at the doctors so i can test my levels. But with health anxiety I'm extremely afraid I've done too much damage that cannot be reversed. I hope thats not the case. I want to start today living a fear and worry free life. I want to be healthy again and really stick to this change. Do you think it's too late? Obviously my doctor is the only one to give me a direct answer but I'm really looking for positive reassurance and comfort in hopes that I am not alone and this is something I can achieve..

Talking about myself and my life is something I never do so I'm asking for everyone to please be kind. And if anyone has any positive stories, or advice to help me get started that would be greatly appreciated. I'm hoping this day chooses my sobriety, instead of me trying to ""find a day"" and I hope im strong enough to stick with it. I'm ready to live..",1767975727.0,14,34,stopdrinking,substance
1q8ciqn,"I had a horrid nightmare, and then I woke up.","I had a dream that my brother and sister-in-law had left me in charge of my one and half year old niece. I dreamt I got wasted and destroyed a house, leaving her in harms way. I dreamt that my brother and sister-in-law called my family, and confronted me. I heard there voices speaking clearly. They told me I would not be allowed around her anymore. That I wasn’t good for her and had to go. It was horrible. 

I woke up crying; my roommate woke up too and checked on me because she heard it. It took me 15 minutes but I realized:

I spent Christmas with my family and I was the only person my niece wanted besides her own mom. She followed me everywhere, screamed my name when I came in the room and wouldn’t go to bed until I came back to the house after a detour. I pushed her around in her new baby stroller, which came with a baby doll that she promptly threw away in declaration that SHE was the baby, for hours. We watched Bluely. We played with her new little kitchen all Christmas Day. My brother and sister-in-law left her with me multiple times and thanked me profusely for being the only one that was engaging her like that so they could take a break. When my sister-in-law left to go get the dog from boarding and the baby was upset, I put on a show in her room for her, where I met every stuffed animal in the room. My brother said, “I’ve heard of Ms. Rachel, but have you heard of Ms. Snootbooper? She’s as engrossed in what you’re doing as she would be to that”.  Everyone wants to touch her because she’s the only baby, but I keep playing it cool, and eventually, my sister-in-law said, “go take a picture with SnootBooper!”, and she ran into my lap. After that, she sat on my lap on the couch multiple times, running to her mom then back to me. I carried her around the restaurant at dinner. 

After Christmas, everyone was talking about it. How good I was with her. How much she’s taken to me.

That little girl has never seen me drunk. She’s starting to speak and has been trying to say my name. I was so, so proud. Everyone was happy. I bought a huge box of presents because money was tight for my mom. I spent months finding the perfect things. I said they were all from Santa but they all knew it was me. I cooked. I got up early. I had to; the baby wanted me. I found my mom’s lost wedding ring, avoiding complete disaster. I helped her walk as she’s been ill.

She went to the hospital last night; one where I used to frequent. I walked in and said “hey mom, isn’t this great?! We’re here and it’s not because of ME!” And she belly laughed. I stayed for four hours, and I’m going back after work today.

I had 14 months yesterday. I will not drink with you today. ",1767975367.0,6,2,stopdrinking,substance
1q8capk,"Straw Poll Saturday for January 10, 2026","Hello, fellow Sobernauts!


[Last week](https://www.reddit.com/user/soberingthought/comments/1q2mhdd/straw_poll_saturday_for_january_3_2026/) we had exactly 1 vote and practically 0 voters for the 46th Straw Poll Saturday, down, like, 100% from 18 [the previous week](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pwncb5/na_beer_bracket_round_2_for_december_27_2025/).

## Round 3 Recap: THE GHOST TOWN ROUND

**Friends, we need to talk.**

After a strong start with 38 voters in Round 1 and 18 voters in Round 2, Round 3 was a complete ghost town. How ghostly? Let me paint you a picture:

- **Athletic Run Wild IPA vs Guinness 0**: 1-0. ONE VOTE. A single solitary soul showed up to cast a ballot for Run Wild, and Guinness 0 - the Irish stout that DEMOLISHED Athletic Free Wave 18-9 last round - received exactly ZERO votes. The marquee matchup we were all hyped for was decided by a coin flip disguised as democracy.

- **Athletic Upside Dawn vs Sierra Nevada Trail Pass**: 0-0. Nobody. Not a single person. The bracket system presumably flipped a coin (Upside Dawn advances).

- **Lagunitas IPNA vs BrewDog Punk AF**: 0-0. Tumbleweeds. Absolute silence. (Lagunitas advances by... existing first alphabetically? Bracket magic? Who knows.)

- **Brooklyn Special Effects vs Deschutes Black Butte Porter**: 0-0. The dark beer showdown that could have been legendary... decided by the void. (Brooklyn advances.)

So after all that Round 1 and Round 2 drama, the Elite Eight was essentially auto-assigned. The bracket marches on, but the people have spoken by not speaking at all.

## Semi-Finals Preview: AN ALL-ATHLETIC SHOWDOWN?!

Despite the voter drought, the bracket has delivered something remarkable: **ATHLETIC BREWING VS ATHLETIC BREWING** in the first semi-final! **Run Wild IPA faces Upside Dawn Golden** - the flagship hop bomb against the crushable golden ale. It's sibling rivalry at its finest, and one Athletic beer WILL fall.

The other semi-final is **Lagunitas IPNA vs Brooklyn Special Effects IPA** - two American craft IPAs battling for a spot in the finals. West Coast hop philosophy meets East Coast brewing pride.

**Can we get some actual votes this round?** I'm not asking for much. Just... more than one. Please. The beers deserve better.

1q8blba,69 Days,"69 days sober today. 

Key takeaways for me:

- Very slow and steady decent into problematic drinking. From Friday night beers in 20s to thrice weekly wine and spirit binges in 30s to daily whisky obliteration in early 40s.

- Current quit attempt #4985 😆 Made it beyond day 3-4 quite a few times. Never longer than two weeks.

- The hours of 5-7pm are the devil for me if there is no plan in place to decompress and migrate from work to home.

- lots of guilt/depression and “feelings” now at the surface. Can currently handle but may seek external support.

- Quit was aided by influenza A. Really took care of those first few weeks.

- There is no moderation. There is no going back. The season finale has happened. It’s done. I now accept this. Even after 6 months, a year, whatever the time period may be, being a normal (whatever the hell that is) drinker does not exist anymore for me and never will again and that is absolutely fine.

- Bars, restaurants, social settings have all been quite manageable. The last bastion, the last test for me, will be flying with lounge access and a nervous disposition. Will need a good plan here.

- Feel a bit healthier and sleeping well. Don’t feel perfect, but I’ll sort my diet out and take this win.

- lastly, this community is the absolute best. So much guidance and thoughts from so many amazing people.

It is like a spirit flowing from me that sometimes cannot be contained. “Real spiritual?” Nah! It’s real fucking spiritual.

Why do you cuss? What about it seems so satisfying? How come you can control your cussing at work or church, but get in front of your friends, and it’s all f-bombs and s-bombs?

**Daily Challenge**

Try not to cuss today. Simple, right?

I have really toned down my cussing over the last few years. I watched videos on cussing. Learned the value of not cussing. Choosing to cuss when I wanted to rather than use it as a filler word every other word. I used to say, ""You can take CDISM out of the streets, but you can't take the streets out of CDISM."" - Today, I see that statement as a copout to the life and behavior I wanted to exemplify. It was just another thing that I needed to conquer. Another bad habit I needed to uncover, discover, and discard.

But sometimes... no other fucking word will do! Honestly.

1q8b6sh,Life's been good*,"Elsewhere in this thread an 'unexpected bonus' of sobriety was mentioned. I'd like to add mine in a separate post because that one is rather... specific.

I was never a party animal, but for a long time, at the parties I attended, I was always the one to stay until closing time. Because until the last call, there was always one more drink to be had. And after the party, why not drop by a night shop? Or why not crash at a friend's place and continue the party there? Why not cancel plans for the next day and hang out for some more drinks instead? You only live once. It's great fun, but stuff that needs done keeps piling up and before you know it, your 'fun' is taking over your life and interfering with basic needs like food, sleep and shelter. So a one night party took me half a week.

Now, 4 months in, I find myself attending 2 social events in one evening and still getting home at an early enough hour to get a good night's rest. I still had at least as much fun as before but the cost was so much lower without the FOMOOB (fear of missing out on booze).

What about you people? What are some unexpected benefits in sobriety that you discovered on your journey, other than the 'huge bonus' and the super power to leave early? Let me know.

I didn't like what I had become and how hard it was to get through even an afternoon without drinking. It become my only preoccupation. I had so. Much. Anxiety. It also didn't help that I worked in restaurants and it was easy to have a serious problem being with other alcoholics and a bar at work. 

About a year ago an interaction with my now ex was life changing. Acter, I ended up going to my friends house where I drank a liter of pb whiskey. When I finally got home, I took a shower. When I was in the shower I heard the door open (I've suffered a lot of abuse so even when I was wasted I was still hypervilligent with my environment). To my surprise it was my 6 year old kid.. I got upset because my ex was supposed to be caring for them because I didn't want them to see me so out of control. I yelled my exs name and ended up scaring my kid. I will NEVER forget the look in their eyes when they saw me and how their little body trembled when I yelled (I usually never yell). Since that night  I quit. I was sick in bed unable to move and throwing up for 3 days straight. I thought I was going to die. I kept replaying my kids horrified face seeing me ... to make sure I wouldn't let this happen again.

Fast forward a year, I've been in therapy. I've built a support network and I'm gaining a lot of momentum in my life. 

I still feel sad I spent so many years running. Hiding from myself and the pain. The pain the kept me so close to the bottle. I can't express how much better my body feels now after a year of sobriety. My nervous system is finally starting to come back online and I'm thankful to actually *FEEL* again. I've realized when I numbed it not only not made me feel the bad things, it also made it so I couldn't feel the *GOOD* either. 

It's still hard.. and even a whif of alcohol is still enough to make me feel like a shark smelling blood in the water. But I can do this. You can do this. We can do this. I wish everyone else out there struggling... wondering if it'll ever be worth it... and all of those in pain... strength and clarity.

1q88anp,Going back to booze after a prolonged period without - how did it go?,"I decided to challenge myself to a year long period off the booze to coincide with some important things I wanted to do in my life.

I’m currently 184 days into this and I’ve managed pretty well to get through Christmas, Birthdays, Weddings etc.

However, I’m already starting to think to the future and whether I’d return to the booze but with a different sense of how to enjoy it rather than being silly with it and ended up to drunk to talk.

Has anyone gone back to it after a prolonged period without booze and regretted it or did it change your way of looking at booze?

1q8895c,Day 19: I confessed to my wife that I spent the entirety of 2025 lying to her.,"November 2024, after a bad week of drinking with friends, I realized that I had a problem with alcohol and determined to stop drinking. I was 25, and I didn’t start drinking til I was 24, so it shouldn’t be hard!

19 days ago I confessed to my wife that I spent 2025 sneaking out to get alcohol. “I’ll go take out the trash!” I’d say as a rush to convenience store for the highest ABV beverages they had in stock, to chug before stumbling through the door, telling my wife I was just tired. I told her that my longest streak of not drinking was 18 days, and my average according to my tracking app was a mere 2.9 days. I told the love of my life that i spent all of 2025 lying to her.

She wasn’t angry, she didn’t cry, instead she was supportive. And now she knows to regularly talk to me about this. After all it’s only day 19, but at least so far in 2026 I haven’t drank longer than the entirety of 2025. 

One fun thing that has motivated me to continue is we made a reward game. We have a whiteboard of “prizes” for not drinking. Day 7 I got an ice cream frappe, Dave 14 we got pizza and watched movies, day 21 I get to buy a video game! Day 60 she said she will do something “special” for me that this sub is not the place to talk about haha.

1q87p2l,Day 5 and a Friday,"5 days is the longest I’ve gone without drinking and I’m proud of myself for getting here despite unsupportive household members.. I live with people who drink and also view addiction and mental health as “fake”.  I can’t change who or where I live at the moment. It’s been a terrible ride so far but I’m determined. If I can get through this first weekend, I know I can do it again next. 

On day 2 a member of the house was trying to open a bottle of wine in front of me knowing I had been on day 2 and had a knowing addiction. I was getting drunk daily and binged weekends. My kryptonite is wine. 

On day 3 the bottle of wine was opened in front of me. A member asked why I was not drinking and I told the truth, that I had a serious issue affecting my daily life that I could not control but wanted to take control. She then asked me to pour her a glass of wine and when I said no prodded me to at least get the bottle for her. I told her WTF, my sister even told her WTF and I successfully with held cravings by going to bed super super early. 

On day 4 same member tells me being addicted to alcohol is fake and NA beer is for stupid people. He said it was like drinking decaffeinated coffee which was pointless and i should either drink real beer or to “just stop drinking alcohol if you’re an addict”. I tried reminding him that if he doesn’t understand an addiction he should keep those comments to himself or tell someone who doesn’t have an active issue. Funny enough, he’s a marine who had a drinking issue all his life and so did his father but has now (2 years now) slowed down due to realizing how toxic he was with it. He still drinks but is able to stay away unlike me where one sip and I’m a goner. 

Anyways, here’s to day 5 and it being a Friday. I’m going to be working double time tonight.

1q87klx,Winters are hard. I have the data,"Once upon a time I had 1000+ days sober. Fell off during covid and have struggled ever since, but have been able to put together 50-60 days straight here or there. I've always known winters are harder for me than other seasons and I know I need to develop some new tools.

My last long-ish sobriety was 60 days in the Fall. I'm a nerd, and trying to switch careers into IT, so I wrote a custom script in a spreadsheet to prompt me with a few questions about my activities, including drinking, and then it populates various stats such as calories saved, # of drinks not consumed, money saved, plus workout and diet notes during that time. After I fell off again, I kept taking notes, at the time thinking that I'd get right back on track quickly. Well, I didn't. From right before Thanksgiving to New Years, I was a mess.

But if I hadn't been tracking it, I would have thought I was only have a couple drinks ever other day or so. But now I'm staring at the spreadsheet and realizing how bad it actually was. Something like 3-7 drinks 6 days a week. Yikes. Way worse than my gut was telling me.

Winters are always hard for me. Driving to and from work in the dark, no social life, not much support. The last few years I've fallen off hard and don't manage to brush myself off and get back at it until late February. I usually have a come-to-Jesus moment staring at myself in the mirror on my birthday around then.

This year, I'm pledging to shorten my annual ""fall off"" period. And I'm pledging to keep tracking myself as it's a daily reminder (along with interacting here) and helps me see patterns in a concrete way.

1q87ied,Day 9 and some things that are working,"Happy Friday! Just wanted to do a quick check-in with some very early observations.

This is my third time even trying to quit in more than ten years. First time was five days. Second time was eleven days. Both felt like white-knuckling the whole time and it was always very front of mind.

This time, I did not get rid of the alcohol in my home. I don’t have much at all, maybe a couple ounces of liquor, but I do have some. This was intentional because I’ve noticed that I have a big scarcity issue / mindset from childhood, where I obsess over running out of things or not having them / not having access. I used to have full blown panic if I felt I might possibly run out of alcohol in the future before I could get more, so I’d buy more, only to not even drink all of what I originally had. It was the \*idea\* of not having it \*if\* I wanted it that bothered me most. So, while this won’t work for everyone, if you are like me (probably childhood poverty related) and are more focused on the prospect of not having access to something in the future, keeping a small amount stopped me from obsessing over obtaining it. I went into a liquor store (related to the second part of this post) and felt zero feelings, because I wasn’t panicked about obtaining.

The first few nights, I was drinking my favorite hot tea and eating skinny pop popcorn for the salt and the feeling of a treat. That worked briefly but it was still too much of a departure from a very deeply engrained routine, so I went and bought “dirty” juice / mixer (olive juice essentially) and blue cheese stuffed olives, and I just mix it with water and use a fancy martini glass. I have been drinking this watery olive juice and chomping olives for the last 4-5 nights, and I scarcely think about the fact that it’s missing alcohol. It just feels the same. I sit down after finishing work and gym, I put on some show I’m binging, and it feels relaxing and like “I’ve earned this.” I think it helps that it’s a drink I’ve only had in the context of drinking, so it doesn’t just feel like “this is just juice / soda / tea and it’s because I can’t have the drink I want.”

Not sure if this helps a single soul, but just some observations.

Last one:

Getting and using a sleep mask for the first time in my life has completely transformed my sleep schedule. I used to not worry about light noise because drinking overpowered it. But then I’d wake around 130, 2, 3am because of the alcohol, and be awake for 2-4 hours. Sometimes I’d have another drink to go back to sleep, even at 5.

Because alcohol was controlling my sleeping and my waking, I never realized that there was so much light in my room from various sources, so now that I’ve removed the alcohol (and that guaranteed wake-up source), light can really mess me up and cause lots of little waking periods. Adding a sleep mask means the difference between five hours and nine. I tested this for two nights, both of which I sort of returned to 3-4am wake-ups. Added it back, and I sleep until my alarm and wake up feeling amazing. Highly recommend.

I would literally play therapist for some rando at the bar or I would tell a stranger my entire life story lol. I was just open.

I’m on Day 1 again. Back from the field with some research. I keep hitting stints of 7 days, 22 days, 14 days etc. Nothing bad happened but I really need some guidance / perspective on drinking in social environments. 

In early sobriety I keep telling myself that I can go to parties, bars, etc and drink NA beer or club soda and vibe. Which I can do, alcohol isn’t really a trigger. The trigger for me is when my “friends” encourage me to drink or I kinda just feel left out (which I know is just my brain making that shit up). 

I guess what I’m asking here is advice on what y’all did in early sobriety that helped you in the first 30,60,90 days. I feel as though I need to make a more concrete plan or just avoid social gatherings that will be triggers early on in my sobriety.

As anyone who looks at my post history knows, I've gone back and forth between sobriety and heavy drinking and use for years now. I had a bad relapse in Mexico at the beginning of December (benzos actually were the culprit not alcohol) and now have 31 days sober. I'm in a different city, in a temporary apartment, finally parted ways with my employer of almost 3 years, I've applied for 15 jobs and not heard one thing back. I have bipolar disorder and although I'm getting help I just feel so down sometimes. Like I'm overweight and super obviously medicated, I walk slow and people pass me and I'm just kind of trudging along, I'm coming up on 35 and with the heaviness of the meds I'm on I'll be lucky to have 15 more good years.

  
A drink would not help. Yes, I'd possibly feel relief, but it's so fleeting. I'd be in the same cycle, here in a city where alcohol is probably the most expensive anywhere in North America, trying to stay afloat, and it would be a disaster. And I have to remind myself of that because many times, I've gone back to the drink. And chaos has ensued. After one bender, I left a package of salami open in my room when I was in the psych ward. I don't drive, which is a blessing, because I know someone whose serving up to 30 years for killing two people driving drunk.

  
31 days with nothing mood altering, probably almost 7 months off booze, I'm not sure exactly, but I'm grateful for every day. AA does help me, but I absolutely understand those who loathe it, I just hope everyone seeks some kind of support if they need it, because we are worth it.

I’m on day 29 and yesterday was utter hell. I haven’t felt so lonely in a long time, and it lasted all day, and I woke up feeling the same. I reached out to some friends but it didn’t really help. One must have missed the part I said I was so sad, one has been sending me hours upon hours of voice notes for weeks about her own life and just continued to do that.

But at this point it sounds the same as everything and everyone else because people are using it for everything. It concerns me and adds to this low feeling.

For background, I started drinking quite heavily when I was 25, I am now 37. I excused it as a bit of fun, I was a mature student and it seemed to come with the territory. What I didn't realise was how I would get so sucked in. I craved anaesthesia. I had some life stuff going on at the time and I convinced myself my drinking was a ""normal and healthy"" amount. I realise now that I was lying to myself, using it to dampen my fears and give me a false sense of bravery.

In 2019, my dad died, complications caused by cirrhosis, caused by long-term alcohol abuse. My dad was a brilliant man and we knew he liked a drink but he worked all his life as an engineer, so he never drank during the day, just when he wasn't at work, so I didn't see it as a problem (it was all I knew, home from work, can in hand). In the end, he was emaciated. Somehow no ascites, but he kept suffering from an infected layer of tissue that covers the organs (can't remember what it's called) and later encephaly. Seeing him like that and realising that he used alcohol the same way I was made me really rethink my habits. He was always there for us, willing to help and guide in any way possible but below that role, he was using alcohol as a coping mechanism, and it ended up being a slow suicide. I wish I could say that after he passed, I immediately spurned into positive action but...I didn't. In fact, I just came up with new excuses why that wouldn't be me. I told myself he drank from much younger right until he was 67, the age he was diagnosed with liver failure (died a year later) and that I had time. But recently, I developed a pain in my side, good old pancreatitis and I know what caused it. I lie to the doctor but I know...

Apologies for the lengthy post. But yeah, 10 days in and finally making it happen. We can't choose how we die but slow suicide won't be mine. I am pleased that I have had no complications not drinking so a saving grace is that my problem was likely more habitual than full chemical reliance.

I didn’t quit because I hit some dramatic rock bottom. I quit because alcohol was quietly keeping me stuck. It made overeating feel normal, skipping workouts feel justified, and “I’ll start next week” feel endless. I was tired of wanting change and not following through.

Being honest: my food still isn’t dialed in, and I haven’t started working out consistently yet. But this is the first time I’ve actually removed the thing that made sure nothing else stuck. That feels like real progress, even if it’s not pretty.

What I’ve learned so far is that sobriety isn’t dramatic; it’s subtle. Better mornings. Clearer decisions. Less mental bargaining. I’m not suddenly motivated every day, but I’m more available to myself.

1q82ok3,Does anyone else still 'feel' hangovers,"I've been sober 3.5 years and last night I was reading a book and the character wakes up hungover and the first chapter goes into a lot of detail about the physical and emotional experience. 

I found it a bit triggering honestly, and I could 'feel' the hangover in my body as I read and still for a while after.

I found for the first year or so sober I constantly felt exhaustion which felt almost cellular, like the hangover was literally embedded into my cells and I couldn't shake the deep exhaustion. 

That's definitely improved but the book made me think of it again. Anyone else experience anything similar?

1q828ek,My wife said she'll leave if I don't get help but I'm scared treatment will make things worse between us,"So this is fucked up but I need honest opinions, my wife gave me an ultimatum last week, either I go to treatment or she's taking the kids and leaving. I know I have a problem, I'm not in denial about that anymore, I drink every night, sometimes during the day, it's bad and I   know it, but here's what's messing with my head - If I go away for treatment, even just a few weeks, what if that time apart is what pushes her over the edge? Like what if she realizes she's happier without me around and decides to leave anyway? At least right now we're still together even if it's barely hanging on. I love her so much I cannot afford to lose her this way

Also I feel like such a piece of shit for even thinking this way. She's literally begging me to get help and save our marriage and I'm sitting here calculating whether treatment might actually end things faster. That's so fucked right? But I can't stop thinking about it

My buddy said his cousin went somewhere small in westwood, 1method I think, and they let family visit and do therapy sessions together which might help? Is that a thing in all places?

Has anyone dealt with this? Did treatment help your relationship or did the time apart fuck things up more?

1q809yu,I think it’s finally time.,"Technically, my first contribution here was a couple of minutes ago under a different post. But I feel like I need to make my own post to keep myself accountable.

Alcohol has stolen so much from me. All three of the aunts I’ve been closest with, along with 3/4 of my grandparents, have died from drinking. My mom is an alcoholic, my dad tried to hit my boyfriend in a drunken rage this past Father’s Day. 

I’ve wrecked multiple cars, gotten two DUIs, fallen asleep out at bars in every conceivable situation. I’m 32F, and these mistakes dominated my 20s. Ruined relationships. Made decisions that led me to losing my previous job almost a year ago (talking too freely around the wrong people after too many drinks.)

My sister was just diagnosed with early stage fatty liver disease. My boyfriends mom is an alcoholic and it has caused trauma in his life as well.

And yesterday, against my better judgement, I went and picked up a bottle of tequila while my boyfriend was at work.

We’re both bartenders, so he got home around midnight. I remember being happy to see him, us ordering Taco Bell…and that’s all. 

This morning he told me he didn’t want to talk to me, and the way I had acted last night was genuinely out of pocket and scary. I think he means aggressive. I say I think because we both went to work, and we exchanged only a few texts about what happened. 

I beat him home from work and retreated to our room so I wouldn’t have to talk to him. I don’t know what to say. We’ve both struggled with alcohol and had to have these talks with each other before, but we already stopped drinking over the summer, because I was so depressed after my dad’s actions in June I got to a really bad place.

My boyfriend has been the only thing keeping me tethered to sanity this past year. 2025 was the hardest year of my life, even including all the terrible shit I listed above from previous years. All the losses, absolutely terrible stuff my mom did when I was a teenager…2025 beat them all.

And what does he get for saving my life multiple times? Holding things down while I looked for work, holding me when my grandmother passed, facing his own fears of death to be with her on the day she died? Dealing with my insane dad he thought loved him? Forgiving me. Again and again.

I’m so upset with myself. I’m scared, I’m ashamed. I can’t imagine live without him. But why should he stay if I don’t quit? I don’t think he should. He’s my whole world and I’ve put him through so much.

We want kids…but I can’t be a mom if I can’t get some good clean time first. I can’t live up to any of my potential if I don’t quit.

Last December- accidental fentanyl poisoning.

Hi, my partner and I went to San Fran last year around this time… 
We were drinking and overall partying having a good time until we bought a bag of cocaine on the street that was laced with Fentanyl.

I woke up in the hospital with frazzled memories of our brief trip but she never woke up.



Fast forward ⏩ I had a stroke and severe nerve damage on my arm due to her crushing me.

I am now a year out and feel so much guilt and shame, and perhaps hatred from her family….
I was never invited to the memorial, neither did I receive ashes. 

I was legally married.


I am currently in therapy but I struggle so much with dealing with the hatred towards me- and the overall blatant disregard of my feelings in this traumatic tragedy. 


**** additionally, since being sober I can say that now after reflecting, I wasn’t even treating her her well enough…. Like on incident I was black out drunk  and had an argument with her about leaving but she said no and kept my keys and I ended up swiping to grab my keys but I remember my fingers got caught in her hair to where even in that moment I got shocked…. In a clear space ——

To where the next two weeks we decided to go to San Fran because it was our happy place——

Fast forward, here we are with this….



I think that’s why it hurts so much because our friends (mostly hers) decided to not engage with me after the incident.

1q7yijj,Venting and what has helped me significantly recently.,"Ok so, to start off I am an alcoholic. It essentially started as soon as I got my hands on 40 hurricanes when I was 18. I’m 32 now. I’m honestly amazed with myself and lucky I have made it this far. Constant, severe and acute episodes of depression (on top of the regular base line), reckless behavior, managing to hold onto my jobs as long as I have. It’s a pretty long list. As I got older I became excellent at sneaking little bottles (or so I thought) and used any spare moment I had to get just another drop in me. Really sad behavior. 

About two years ago I managed to get two years of sobriety under my belt which was absolutely a record for me. I eventually caved after that and picked up my old habits again as one would when you even entertain the idea. Since relapse I have gotten a couple of weeks here and there. Life was turning to crap again.

Ok so currently I have been sober all this month so far (a few days or two before the new year but I decided to just mark January first for simplicities sake. I decided to try something different this time. After getting over the initial week or so of the withdrawals, I decided to take up fasting. First a couple of days, then three. I just recently accomplished 7 days of fasting and I feel better than I have in the longest time. For me it was interesting test of my discipline and I knew there should be some health benefits that may come along with this test. During my fast I was so focused on my goal I didn’t even have time for self pity or thinking about alcohol. My brain feels sharper, I have my energy, I appreciate food more now. I’m working on my relationship with food. I don’t believe it is helpful to just obsessively eat out of boredom or anxiety. Eating heavy just made me more tired and sluggish. I also feel if I can display this kind of discipline in regard to what I put in my body why should I not be able to do that with alcohol? 

TLDR; after over a decade of being an alcoholic fasting has really giving me a new perspective on my mind and body and for the first time in a long time I actually feel there is a glimmer of hope for me. Thanks for reading. ",1767932671.0,3,3,stopdrinking,substance

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**  Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink.*  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**  A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:**  A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hey Friends!  Happy Friday!

Let’s talk about **Freedom** today.

I try to always remind myself that *sobriety is a gain*, *not a loss*.  It provides us the freedom to live a fulfilling life without the chains and cycle of destruction.

For me, I have the freedom to do what I want when I want.  I’m no longer planning the next drink.  Making plans based on whether drinking can be involved.  Figuring out rides to and from events.  I have given myself this freedom and it’s absolutely wonderful.  

Something I’ve done a few times sober is go to concerts alone.  I’m confident and aware of my surroundings.  I save money. And I can drive to and from the venue without relying on other people.

What’s something that you get to do sober that used to feel impossible?

Share your “freedom” moment with us!

1q7wjp1,Oral Thrush Gone,"Had chronic oral thrush (my tongue was always white especially toward the back) for years. Couldn't figure out the cause, nothing dietary was helping, and tongue scraping + brushing did little.

Day 8 of no alcohol whatsoever. Happened to see my tongue in the mirror when I was brushing my teeth and saw that it was completely 100% pink again, not even a speck of thrush anywhere in sight.

Not always but it seems like it's more and more often these days... I'm a heavy drinker 100% but this just started happening within the last like 2 months or so where it seems as if it's a bit more often than normal.

Sometimes after a binge session I'll wake up at 2am with a racing heart for about an hour, fall asleep again and wake up feeling fine but it's scary and super uncomfortable feeling. I know it's from alcohol so, I do what I can to calm myself and it goes back to normal eventually but sometimes it takes a solid 24 hours for that to happen.

I normally drink around 100 OZ of water a day but I notice when I don't drink much water, and drink a lot... it's far worse. I also found out that gatorade helps tremendously in calming my heart rate for some reason",1767927063.0,2,9,stopdrinking,substance

1q7w7tg,Feeling uneasy,"I don’t really know how to put this into words. I’ve never been the best at writing but I feel so uneasy right now it’s weird to describe. I recently quit drinking about 2 weeks ago and I’ve been feeling more depressed than I have ever been even though I have more positives in my life than ever before…or so I think. There’s this weird longing for something in my body though that I can’t pinpoint. Maybe it’s because I am about to turn 30 and my friend group has drastically dwindled partly due to myself. As I sit here typing this I wonder why I can’t seem to text back my best friends a simple sentence but can get on Reddit and write this. Everything feels impossible to do, even the simplest of tasks and what makes it worse is I’m a manager at a restaurant so I feel a never ending sense of responsibility and duty. I love my job so much, it’s been a blessing to work with lots of great people but I feel like it’s been burning me out lately. I also feel like I don’t do enough to be burnt out.

Anyway my brain continues to go down a rabbit hole of one thought to the next so it’s hard to articulate properly. At the end of the day I am depressed, I am sad, anxious, burnt out, and feel like I don’t do enough for those I love. I hate this feeling so much. I just want it all to stop. Why can’t I be happy and have more energy? I just needed to get this off my chest and some reason it feels just a bit better to type out how I’m feeling

I won’t drink today, but alcohol has definitely been on my mind a lot. I feel really alone and sad. I hope this feeling doesn’t last too long.",1767926302.0,2,3,stopdrinking,substance

My drinking got worse, it moved from an evening ""unwind"" and subsequent shitty sleep, into midday quick drinks to chase the hangover away, and buzzed Saturday where I'd be sneakily drinking all day. 

My amazing wife has known something was up for awhile and I even had a half assed attempt at moderation in early 2025 (which failed of course). I confessed it all this morning and was meet with nothing but love and support. Now the hard part begins.

I need to stop now. I have an appointment with my GP but the earliest I could get in is next week so for now Im tapering down. All the alcohol has been removed. My ability to purchase more also removed and any tapering amount is being managed by my wife. Although the addict brain in me is still like "" ou can I have my next taper dose now? How about now?""

1q7vad4,Day 8,"Hey all, long time lurker and love this sub! Recently decided to use Dry January as a way into sobriety. I (37M) have always been a social/weekend/binge drinker. 

Over the past few years that has devolved into daily drinking. Beers to start, then vodka mixed drinks, and over the last year 2-3 beers and 5-7 fireball shooters basically every single night. Obviously, a problem but never missed work, coached my kids sports teams, never drove, and was never an angry drunk. But made an ass out of myself a cringey amount of times, began to affect my work and obviously prevented me being the best father I could be. Also got scared of the health problems. 

I am “California sober” currently and it’s been pretty mild. My main issue stems around either ADHD (not diagnosed) or anxiety or a combination of the two. Drinking was a pretty great way to “calm” my brain and the internal monologue. Any small mistake at work or perceived failure will paralyze me for the rest of the night. I decided to make an appointment to see my doctor today and honestly I felt really good today. I ended up being prescribed Lexapro and took the first dose tonight. Now I have anxiety about taking lexapro haha! 

I have a follow up appointment in a month and I’ll get a liver panel and other bloodwork done. anyways just wanted to check in and let you all know how much I appreciate this sub! IWNDWYT",1767923873.0,1,0,stopdrinking,substance

I decided to call the coworker that I was frustrated with. I calmly explained to him how his actions were not appropriate and not appreciated by me.

Our management team supported my decisions and signed off on them (regardless of his extremely unprofessional approach today). And then I told him to have a good weekend.

1q7urlx,5 YEARS SOBER!!!,"I don't think I've ever felt more pride than I do this week. Yesterday was my victory lap. 5 years ago I made the best, hardest, and most important decision of my life and took my last drink. In making that decision I also decided I wanted to live. I realized I wanted and deserved better than I had led myself to believe and that I wasn't just the sum of my all mistakes which were plentiful. 

I was going to write this whole long thing about what I've learned in sobriety but honestly the only thing that matters to me this. In a few months I'm giving birth to a little girl and although I know I won't be a perfect mom, I know down to my core that I'm going to be a loving, calm, and steadfast presence in her life. My daughter will know that I've done the work and will continue to do so I can always be there for her. One thing I told myself over and over again after I got sober was that I did not pull myself out of hell to live a life I didn't want to live. Part of the goal is creating a life you don't want to escape from. That meant making hard decisions, having hard conversations, being honest about what I do and don't want out of life, and stepping many miles outside of my comfort zone. And to me our daughter is a manifestion that.

Im grateful to be alive. I grateful to be out of the darkness. I'm grateful to my friends and family that loved me even when I was a mess. I'm especially grateful to my husband who has been there every single step. I did the heavy lifting but he never shamed me. He just loved me and gave me a safe space to do the work so I could save myself. It is the kindest thing anyone has done for me. 

If you're still struggling I just have this to say: Sobriety is more than just not drinking. It's a healing process. For me it felt like I was relearning how to exist in the world. Be kind and patient with yourself. You didn't get to this place in your life overnight. It's going to take time to untangle all the knots. But when you do I promise it is the most beautiful, freeing, and rewarding thing you'll ever experience. ❤️",1767922507.0,285,20,stopdrinking,substance
1q7urjf,Got Sober And People Couldn't Stand It,"Straight to the point, I recently quit drinking. I wouldn't say I was a alcoholic, or a terrible drunk, but I showed my ass a few times, and overall realized I was using it as a escape. Fast forward to now, I'm alot sharper,  more confident, and just generally more comfortable in my own skin. My efficiency at work, and overall performance skyrocketed, probably isn't relevant, but I work in the trades. Anyways I noticed alot of people around me seem butthurt, or intimidated by the new me. I'm straight to the point, just do my job, and I'm not as emotional. You can't really get a reaction out of me, I'm just like whatever it's cool. It made me realize, it's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. People don't really wanna see you win, or improve your life. They want you in the same boat as them, they want power over you in one form or another aka co dependency. I also realized these same people aren't any better then me, I could go a step further, and say there pretty incompetent, and deny any accountability. To me thats the worst trait, because if your wrong, and can't accept your wrong, you'll never correct, and progress forward. It's honestly a sad cycle, and really demoralizing. You just wanna grab them, and say hey your not a victim, your not being held back, take control of your life, and make a move. I understand that mentality, it's everyone else, it's not me, but once I looked at myself and said, I'm not gonna live like this I'm not gonna accept mediocrity, and settle people really didn't like my change of attitude. Yet when I was in the victim mindset, the same people would tell well it's your fault, the only one who can fix it is you. Now that the shoes on the other foot they don't have the same energy. 

Rant over. I just wanted to put this out there, so maybe someone can relate, or they needed to hear this. Your not alone, life is a up hill battle there's alot of things you can't control, but dammit there's alot of things you can. ",1767922501.0,19,2,stopdrinking,substance

1q7ulr5,Terrifying Moments of Clarity,"Hi. 80 days sober today. When I quit drinking, I switched careers. I used to be a long time server and getting away with being drunk was incredibly easy and I always had good company. I am now a pre-school teacher. I love my job. It is like nothing I have ever experienced. I am also back in school. I am taking an intensive course to become certified and two others at the local community college to begin a degree in ECE. There have been many changes in just this short amount of time. My supervisor called me in today to give me a review. Not to sound full of myself, but she raved about me. Told me how happy they are to have me and how excited they are to see me advance. One thing in particular stuck with me. She said, ""you are everything you said you'd be."" It was a gut punch. My first instinct was to tell her that just 80 days ago I was an untrustworthy, hopeless, lying, loser. That I made sure every opportunity I was given, burnt to the ground. I didn't say that of course, but it has been rattling around in my brain all day. I just keep having these moments of clarity that I did everything drunk. That I thought it was totally normal to be shitfaced at work at 11 am on a Tuesday. That it was ok to drive after I've had 5 nips. That everyone only ate every couple of days. That it was not only normal, but vital to always be a little bit drunk. It's like waking up for the first time. And not just waking up, but really changing into someone reliable, fun, hardworking, honest, loyal. A little girl came up to me while I was waiting for the bus to come get our group of kids. She isn't in my class, but I see her daily and our class sometimes plays with theirs during recess. She just smiled, leaned into my legs and pulled my hand down to her face. I responded by stroking her cheek and humming a little song. Even though I am not her teacher, I make her feel safe. I never want this to go away. I never want to give this up. I apologize for the rant. I'm just feeling so many things right now and not really sure what I'm looking for. Thanks for reading.",1767922075.0,30,12,stopdrinking,substance

1q7u2n7,My friend encouraged me to be here,"So I’ve struggled with addiction of basically whatever for the last 18 years. My biggest accomplishment is I’m nearing 12 years clean from heroin. But I used alcohol to fill that void . Alcohol has done nothing but cause pain to those around me . 2 DUIs, a few other arrests for fighting or just drunk and disorderly, and multiple tickets when I was in high school. I’ve totaled a truck and had many small wrecks. I’ve ruined many relationships , especially getting kicked out of thanksgiving once. Some how I’ve managed to stay married for 4 years now but my drinking will definitely separate us. About two years ago, I had an ultimatum to stop or divorce. So I quit, but i jumped quickly to weed to fill the void since my state is legal. Well about 1.5 years went by sober and I never felt any change in my mental health. Still depressed daily. I talked to my wife about it and she said I could drink again but only special occasions and no more than a 12 pack . Well the next day just so happened to be a gathering so I took advantage. Snuck a few extra beers but didn’t get crazy. Then that following week I decided to drink after work . Nothing major. My wife wouldn’t notice if I had just a 4 pack of 16oz beers on the ride home. Which turned into another 4 pack and a couple shots. Obviously she smelt it on my breath and told me to seek help immediately. I called a hotline( don’t remember which) and this dude straight up told me I needed 28 day inpatient or I’ll never change. Well I can’t miss a month of  work so I didn’t go but I’ll never forget him saying that I will eventually lose everything and be a homeless drunk. I chose the next best option and started AA meetings a few times a week for about a month but the religious part isn’t for me so I quit going. I went back to drinking but just on Friday or Saturday if we went out. I was doing fine with that routine. Then this past October I started working out of town with our company’s drunk. I was away from home for 4 days a week. I couldn’t resist the urge, especially since my coworker is an alcoholic. So I started drinking daily again and also drinking on the clock. I would binge those 4 days without my wife knowing and then come home and usually drink on the weekend too. My depression only got worse. One day I drank 16 beers on the 2.5 hr drive to the jobsite on Monday and then I felt frisky so I asked a homeless man if he could hook me up with meth. Well my luck, he did and I went on a 4 day bender. I was sitting in the hotel after work those days paying girls on onlyfans to chat with me so I didn’t feel alone. Well I was finally able to switch out with someone else in mid December so I could be home daily again. We had my family’s Christmas party on Dec 20th and I was excited to announce we’re pregnant. Of course I lost control and blacked out. Woke up to my wife telling me all the usual things I do. Get loud, obnoxious, turn into the class clown basically while making a fool of myself. I once again had a moment of clarity that I should stop. So I did again but this time with no announcement so I don’t let anyone down if I slip. My wife busted me on the weed Sunday so i finished my vape by Tuesday afternoon. I’m completely drug free for the past 48 hrs now and almost 3 weeks without a drink . 

I desperately want to remain this way but idk how to fill the gap of my self destructive behaviors. Idk if it’s  bc I started abusing everything young or what but i can’t process emotions without running to some sort of substance. I’m diagnosed with ADHD and major depressive disorder and my psych said my childhood trauma turned substance abuse is textbook. Just recently I had my meds changed AGAIN for like the 10th time in 6 years. I’m running out of options , my wife is tired of seeing me cycle between weed and alcohol and sobriety. I just want to be happy again but I don’t even know what that feels like anymore organically. We have our first baby due in August and I don’t want to be a loser dad or worse, get divorced. 

Someone please give me guidance. I want stay on this current path but depression is holding me back from doing anything about it other than just remaining sober. I lost my local therapist thanks to insurance changes but she wasn’t helpful . Just not the right fit . Last night, I was home alone and had a mental break and just cried for like two hours . Reflecting on my pathetic existence and wondering if it’s best to let my loved ones move on from me for their sake. I have a some real good friends in a discord server that talked me down but then I couldn’t sleep. I’ve been up for about 38 hours now so sorry for this long story but that’s everything I wanted to say and thank you in advance if you took the time to read all this.

1q7sunc,A stark realisation,"
My drinking spiral began when someone I love dearly died right in front of my eyes. I was a very heavy pot smoker for years, and when I lost my loved one - everyone time I was high I turned into a sobbing mess. So I put down the leaf and picked up the drink. 

Shitty thing after shitty thing came up and the more that happened, the more I drank. 

Last year was so incredibly hard. Every part of my life felt like it was falling apart. As the end of the year approached, I was determined to finally put the bottle down. I’ve never spent Xmas or New Year’s Eve sober and 2025s Xmas and New Year’s Eve were the best! 

My mind is clearer, as is my skin! I’m sleeping better AND I’m working on myself and my passions more. 

I’m almost 3 weeks back in the sober saddle and have only JUST come to realise and admit to myself that -

I carry way too much trauma to be able to just simply enjoy an alcoholic beverage. I literally cannot do it.

I can't count the amount of times I've quit ""for good, for real this time I promise, never again"", but this is the most hopeful and determined I've felt, and the longest I've made it of my own volition.

1q7s8jn,Starting to go down hill again need strength to stop before I go over the edge,long story short I’ve had problems with alcohol my whole adult life. I had a period of 2.5 years without a drink but relapsed badly due to stress and lost pretty much everything I had and ended up going to jail. I’ve been out since July and working but I started just drinking after work just two tall boys at the start. I’m now up to like 6 every night and I’m not dependent on alcohol at this point because I don’t get withdrawal and I’m sober the first half of the day but it’s getting there. last night I drank a ton and started throwing up violently and my cat gets freaked out and attacks me. She’s the sweetest little cat ever and very timid but there was a time in the past where I had a horrible leg cramp and started screaming and she attacked me. Happened again last night and she was attacking me while I’m over the toilet puking my dinner all over the place. I just felt so pathetic. And it’s also such a waste of money. I also have been to the hospital 6 times in my life for acute pancreatitis from drinking and if I refrain from alcohol it’s fine but it’s just another reason to stop. I feel like I’m at that edge again where I’m going to start drinking all day long and my life will be destroyed again. Thanks for reading.,1767916103.0,1,0,stopdrinking,substance

The project manager that always said ""I never claimed to be good at my job"" was laid off. Not shocked.

My boss who's life is imploding because of her alcoholic soon-to-be-exhusband, has a big heart, but cant handle life on life's terms? Also laid off.

My 60+ year old coworker who was doing a great job. Laid off too.

More happened in other departments. And why? Growth. This is besides the point here.

I don't love alcohol like I did speed but I'm not good at moderating sometimes and those times cost me too much. I finally feel at peace with deciding I'm gonna abstain even though I don't identify as an alcoholic. 

I feel happy sober and I have spent a lot of time at home lately. Before I couldn't stand being at home with myself but now I love it. I have two cats and one is a kitten I'm taking lots of care in raising her, cooking more, taking care of myself, reading a little. I love my job. Im enjoying taking care of myself. I feel happy, save for the anxiety about how my DWI will turn out (it was a high BAC and I'm in Texas so theres a good chance I'm facing a conviction, just hoping and praying I can still get hired on permanently at my job and finish my masters in social work, i have a lawyer trying to help me get the charge reduced). 

I think I finally am feeling stable and at peace, I'm just worried that I'm hiding from the world. I have abstained for nearly two years before in my early twenties so I felt a lot of pressure then to continue going out even though I hated it.

Just venting mostly. Having been in that sober glow I miss it so much and I know what I need and I’m trying to fight time, which is a useless plight. Time is what it takes.

Anyway. I guess the good thing about wanting that feeling back so bad is it makes saying no today so much easier, and looking forward to another sober day so much more exciting to see what changes come. This is closest I’ve monitored my body, brain, thoughts instead of giving in to the panic of withdrawal. I want it so bad.

I might drank a lot once a month, or every two months, when out with friends.

My blood work was always perfect. Then, heavy grief came into my life. At first, it was, “let’s have a drink to forget what happened,” and then it turned into, “let’s have another.”

On January 1st, I decided it was over. I was extremely dedicated or at least, I thought I was. Then, I relapsed.

I haven’t been drinking daily since, yet I let myself drink twice in the past eight days, and both times, I drank a lot. Meanwhile, I went out with others who were drinking, but I didn’t join them.

This month, I had a personal record for skipping alcohol over the past year, yet I don’t know how to feel. Should I feel proud for at least giving my body a break, or feel completely useless for failing my goal which was not drink at all?

1q7phgz,How well do you cope with people abusing substances around you?,"I spent the holidays at my parents' with my partner, my brother and his friends. My parents and my brother are big drinkers, so they were constantly popping open bottles and discussing how good these tasted among themselves. As an alcoholic, I already feel out of place as it is and I'd never really considered asking for people to be sober (or less enthusiastic on drinking) around me. However after relapsing after the holidays and discussing this with another sober friend, she pointed out how she felt my family should be more mindful of my struggles.

This clicked something in me because to me, as an addict, I feel it's a given that I wouldn't smoke a cigarette around someone who's trying to quit nicotine, for example. To me that's basic empathy. However, once discussing this with my partner, who's not a big drinker but a big stoner, he played devil's advocate and said my family can't know about my triggers, which is a fair point. I told him as an example that sometimes hanging out with him while he's high can be a bit triggering too and I soon after caught him smoking weed hidden in the bathroom.

I've been thinking about this for a while and I wanted to ask you, my sober community, how you cope with people drinking/using drugs around you? Does it trigger you or not really? And if it does, how much can we ask/expect other people to be sober in our company without trespassing others' individuality?

1q7p6jj,My story,"Hello all,


Here’s my r/stopdrinking story. I’ve been wanting to tell this story for a number of years, but I never seem to have the time or ability to sit down and write it. When I decided, five years, three hundred and five days ago to stop drinking, it was a combination of your stories and strangers on YouTube that were my support system. It is my hope that sharing my story can help someone else and repay the gift you all have given me.


My story begins in my mid teens when I discovered the wonders of alcohol. I started drinking at parties and socially because it helped me cope with an unrecognized anxiety disorder. I was nervous and awkward around other people, but once I had a few drinks in me I could be best friends with anyone.


I drank constantly, late into my 30s, never letting on to my friends or family how much I depended on it. I surrounded myself with the culture of alcohol production and consumption to hide it from my friends. I knew everything I could about beer styles, yeast strains, hops alpha acids, types of drinkware, etc… my friends saw me as an expert of sorts, a guy that drinks all the time because he’s knows so much about it, not because he has a problem.


I had a particularly insidious form of an alcohol problem because I had learned to keep it under the radar from most people. I knew exactly how much I could drink without raising suspicion. I never got out of control to the point where I obviously needed help and I felt like this was my permission slip to keep going. No one was telling me I should stop, except for my wife.


She was the only one that knew me well enough to see what was happening and I went out of my way to hide it from her. I would drink secretly behind her back and hide the empty bottles.
Things got really bad near the end. I was slipping up and getting blackout drunk unintentionally. I came into the office and vomited in my trashcan from being so hungover from the night before. I was flirting dangerously close to disaster. One night, while making dinner, I was drinking behind my wife’s back and pushed it too far. I ended up waking up at 4AM on the bathroom floor covered in vomit and had to go to work in a few hours. A sane person would’ve called out, but I soldiered through. That was normal for me.


Later my wife told me my daughter was up sobbing that night because she thought I something was really wrong when I didn’t tuck her in bed that night. That was soul crushing and I still get upset thinking about it all these years later. I knew I had to do something and that’s when I found this group.


I visited here often in those first few days, weeks, and months. Quitting was one of the hardest things I’d ever done and I desperately needed that support. I can’t thank everyone enough for sharing their stories about quitting, struggling, relapsing, and recovering. It made me realize how difficult it can be and that I’m not alone.


I wish I could say everything was immediately better after I quit using alcohol to manage my problems, but that wasn’t the case at all. If anything, it made them seem exponentially worse. I went through some of the toughest bouts of anxiety and panic attacks I’ve ever experienced. Quite frankly, it was a fucking nightmare trying to learn how to live and function without alcohol in my life. Instead of numbing my problems away, I had to face them head on. I had to learn new ways to cope and process my past traumas instead of deflecting them.


To this day, I’m still learning how to be myself and comfortable in certain situations without a drink in hand… but it’s gotten better. Life is easier now. It’s been difficult to get here, but I genuinely don’t feel the urge or desire to drink anymore. I’ve found new ways to manage my anxiety an deal with stress. Most importantly, I’ve been present for my wife and daughter, every single day. I do believe it’s been worth the effort. If you’re still reading this and thinking about quitting, or struggling too, I promise you can do this. It may be one of the most difficult things you’ve ever done, but you can do it. I’d love to help you and I know there’s plenty more in this group that feel the same.


Take care of yourself, you are worth it.

1q7ns5v,Phantom Hangovers? 8 Days Sober from Alcohol. 3 Days Sober from my Ex!,"Hi All, Happy New Year, and a happier dry January! Whether you just started or you're continuing on, good for you!

I decided to do another dry January. My first one in 2024 led to 2 years of sobriety. I had some slips and made some choices, but I've always returned to sobriety. Every day I don't drink is another day my life improves. I don't feel, think, or drink the way I used to. I successfully changed my relationship with alcohol, but not so much that I think I could have a healthy one with it. That would make an oxymoron out of me!

In the first week, I felt hungover a couple of mornings. Just tired and a little wobbly on my feet. The exhaustion and brain fog are starting to clear now. I did indulge over the holidays, and I did use it as a distraction, but no benders or binges. On New Year's Eve, I drank cranberry ginger ale and some bubbly rosé but enjoyed a hangover-free New Year's Day.

One of my stresses, ending and starting the year, was my year-and-a-half live-in partner turning out to be a cheat, liar, and cokehead, but not in that order! LOL. I was so incredibly stressed and devastated at how our relationship ended, and I was tempted to drink, but I didn't. Being sober helped me realize my ex is a Peter Pansexual going through a midlife crisis at 41. I guess he doesn't know how harmful drugs and alcohol can really be eh? He's too selfish to see the damage his actions have on me, his friends, his career, and this remote community that's struggling with trying to get rid of dealers, not support them. But that's an issue, not an ish-me.

I saw the quote: ***There's no situation that alcohol can't make worse.*** It's a great reminder that I don't need to distract myself or deal with the pain of betrayal by going into a bottle or can. It's also a HUGE motivator to retain my sobriety and peace! It's easier to be sober without stress, but when shit hits the fan, it's so much more satisfying to choose sobriety over an easy fix.

But I don’t even want a beer, actually couldn’t think of anything worse than going the pub tonight. There’s even a couple of beers in the fridge I could have if I wanted, but I don’t.

1q7m0dd,100 days!,"i've been sober for 100 days and it doesn't feel real honestly. it's been a rough 3 months. my ebike (my only transportation) was stolen, i'm back on a manual bike, i went back to an old job after working 9 months at a pretty terrible restaurant, my dad who i barely had a relationship with died last week. i feel proud of myself for the most part, but i'm just so tired most of the time and sleep has been hard to find lately.

even with all of that, i'm so glad i'm sober. things are easier to handle. the threat of ever experiencing another hangover is usually enough to keep me from giving into a craving. my mental health is stable, even though the dips are still there and still rough. i can bear them better. my body feels so much better, my stomach is rarely upset now. my face is less puffy, my skin's clearer. no more headaches except when i'm trying to cut caffiene.

1q7lra7,Dry Januaryists - day 8 Data,"If you’re feeling like the ""new year energy"" is starting to dip, I found that focusing on the data really helped me stay motivated.

Early in my sobriety, I discovered an app called “I’m Done” (I think I heard about it here in this group). I found it incredibly useful in the early days; I’d just open it and watch the time, savings, and calories ticking by. It made my progress feel tangible when my brain was trying to tell me I hadn't achieved much.

I look at it less regularly now, but it’s nice knowing it’s there ticking away in the background. My current stats are:

• Days sober: 1,167

• Money saved: £17,763

• Calories saved: 582,641

Now, I take these numbers with a pinch of salt—I still spend money and consume calories on 0% drinks, and I still buy rounds for my friends. But seeing it laid out like that is a huge driver for me.

On the calorie front, what I’ve noticed is that at 38, I can pretty much eat what I want - though I cut out ultra processed foods about a year in and that was game changer for gut health and energy. I’m generally active, but I don’t do masses of intense exercise, and yet I’m the fittest I’ve ever been. I personally dropped about 10–12kg in the first two months of sobriety alone.

If you like seeing the numbers, I’d recommend checking out a tracker. Most of them are free and they provide a great visual reminder that every hour you choose not to drink, you are winning.

1q7kctg,Any experience with state- or other funded inpatient or outpatient in or around New Jersey?,"I am asking as I help a friend find treatment several states away from me, they have been on and off the wagon for a few years now although have made some very good progress since I sobered up in March 2023. They have been struggling through the holidays and feel like treatment is the best option to get them straightened out, but only have state money to work with. 

If anyone has any feedback about a facility they have visited in or near NJ that used Medicaid or otherwise had a scholarship or donor program that you used, it would be helpful. There seem to be a ton of for-profit ""resource"" sites that try to point me to a few but I am hoping to distinguish them a bit more beyond the algorithm (and to do it quickly instead of days of research on my own so I can hopefully get them a place in line somewhere). They are located closer to Philly than anything else but it ultimately doesn't matter if it isn't too far away, while they have a stable place to live at present, bike is the only transport so a day program needs to be relatively near.

TL;DR- have you attended a private rehab program using donor money, or state-funded inpatient or outpatient in New Jersey? Do you have any recommendations I can use to narrow down what I am finding in searches? Thanks for any info you can give, I am trying to find help for my friend on the coast

But now I think about my friends (many of whom do not drink anymore) and it feels good to hear things are changing. 46% of US adults do not consider themselves drinkers. That’s almost a coin flip!

I am 42, single and lately have noticed that I am dropping friendships. In general, I tend to isolate. It requires a lot of effort to invest in relationships, and I do not want to use sobriety as an excuse to not do that.

The happy hour hang was always a very easy, convenient way to spend some low-key time with others, especially people I see only rarely. My main friend group and myself are also kind of socially lazy.. so it'll be like 6pm on a Friday and we'll want to hang out, and the easiest way to do that is to go to a brewery since it is central and requires no planning. And then meeting new people, I notice that it's kind of the classic move after the official event to go out for a beer and that's the way to build relationships.

I think it is also worth mentioning that a lot of my friends are not heavy drinkers. In fact, apparently I am the one who tends to set the pace. I guess I say this because these really are people I want to spend time with - they aren't just drinking buddies.

1q7h86b,Restarted...,"So, there was a time a couple years ago where I had a nice long stint of sobriety. I don't remember when or how I abandoned it but it started off with ""just a few"" on the weekends. I thought (as so many others have) that I could moderate. I even did the Hard75 challenge and had a two+ month stint without alcohol. Fast forward to early December. I woke up completely hungover after a night where my heart rate wouldn't drop below 120, I couldn't stop sweating and felt like total dog poo.

It was a new moment of clarity.

I realized (again) I couldn't moderate. I realized (again) what alcohol was doing to my health. It was sabotaging my fitness goals: to compete in 2026 in Master's CrossFit competitions and trying to lose some weight. When I passed out from drinking it kept my wonderful wife from getting a good night's sleep. Moreover, I perceived with great clarity that if I continued with the way I was going it was going to affect my ministry as I'm set to be ordained as a Deacon in the Catholic Church in June. I asked myself what if someone needed me at a hospital this morning feeling the way I did, or worse, if I got a call the night before when I was literally unconscious. I realized I had a handful of really compelling ""why's"" and it was time to make a change. A permanent change. A change for me first of all, but a change that will benefit all those around me. That was the morning of 12/12 and I set a new stop date of 12/14.

So far, so good. I made it through Christmas - here at home and at the in-laws. We went to our friends' New Year's Eve party and the strongest drink I had was a couple of caffeine-free Diet Pepsi's. Today I'm struggling with a cold. I'm tired and don't feel good. I realized as I journaled this morning that I needed to be on my guard as I work and rest from home today. There's at least two triggers I better watch out for: tired and bored. Not to mention just not feeling good. That part of my brain started putting the suggestion of ""you know what would make you feel better..."" and I put that to rest by remembering that alcohol is a sedative (it's going to make me more tired) and I'm going to feel worse tomorrow morning because of potential hangover but also restarting after 25 days.

I had nothing going on in my life but the next drink, now me and my friend are auditioning for theatre and joining a local chorus!

To cap it off, last weekend I met someone. Had the best first date I think I’ve ever had. Stone cold sober the whole time; he doesn’t drink either which is just perfect!

1q7eylz,This is why quitting is so hard. For me at least.,"I'm on day 5. My job pisses me off every single day. The only thing that makes it bearable is knowing if I just get through it, I can crack open a beer or pour a glass of wine when I get off. And yes a beer turns into 4-6 and a glass of wine turns into a bottle. Sometimes less and rarely more. My primary reason for quitting drinking is my sleep. I wake up every night around 2am and struggle to go back to sleep. So I pretty much feel like crap because of constant lack of sleep. But here's the problem. I know the sleep will eventually improve because I've taken breaks before, but 5 days in and not a single decent night's sleep and my job still pisses me off except worse because my evening coping mechanism is gone and the reward of a good night's sleep isn't there. And finding a different job isn't an option. In my profession they all suck at least where I live and moving isn't an option either. Anyways. Just needed to vent.

1q7eo7r,Tips for staying sober during bachelor party,"Title pretty much says it all. I am in early days of sobriety, and have a tendency to allow one night of drinking to turn into a weekend bender. 

Generally, I can hold my own with alcohol and usually control myself well even when wasted. But I am honestly tired of it, especially how I feel days after just a single binge session. 

Ideally, I'd like to go to this bachelor party and have a *few* beers over the weekend. If I intentionally make myself wait until late night to drink, I can minimize the amount I drink over the weekend. 

But wait....this sounds like bargaining and alcoholism sneakily trying to justify its way into my life. I'd say there's a 50% chance a few drinks turns to a bender, and a 50% chance I can stick to 3-4 beers each night and avoid day drinking. 

So in that case, any tips on how you guys have been able to stay strong in heavy drinking environments? If I truly wanted to eliminate the pressure I wouldn't go, but I feel obligated as it's a close friends bachelor party. ",1767885998.0,3,19,stopdrinking,substance
1q7efzc,"Progress... January 8, 2026","My posts (and books) are not perfect. Though I would love it if it were. Let’s consider this an exercise in acceptance. You will read some bad ideas, a lot of repetition, typos, and grammatical errors. Are you going to be okay with that? I would love to have my posts (and book) be a treasure-trove of witty epithets and pithy words that I could look so smart to espouse, but let’s get one thing straight, I am not going to waste my time. “Perfect” is the enemy of “good enough.” And that’s what these messages (and book) are aiming for. ~~Don’t forget to rate and review!~~

**Reflections**

Are you the type of person who won’t start something unless you know you can do it “perfectly?” Do you get paralysis when it comes to things you’ve never done before? How will you ever get better? How about spilling coffee on a white shirt on the way to work? Do you leave it? And if you do, do you think about it all day and let it steal your happiness?

**Daily Challenge**

Don’t wash the car. Don’t change shirts. Don’t pick it up (let someone else do it, for once). Try something new. Be unsure. Be messy. Be uneasy with being uneasy.

I used to be so particular about things. Especially stains on my clothes. Trying to hold that perfect image. So afraid to let people see the ""messy me"". All the while, I was shitting blood and getting drunk every night in isolation. Also, I loved to write, but was too afraid to show anyone my work for fear that they might criticise me, or worse, see a fucking typo! Oh no! Eight years into soriety, I was writing a book, I had to remind myself that it was not going to be perfect and it would have to be ""ok""... and that I would be ""ok"" if it wasn't.

PROS: 

- So much more patient. I don't typically get upset about things and realize they'll pass on by eventually
- Anxiety and depression are almost nonexistent. Like, sometimes I am in awe of how I suffered and can't really remember the feeling of it 
- I dont procrastinate and nag myself all day. I just do it. Laundry? Ok, takes five minutes to toss in. Clean the kitchen? Probably 35 if I just do it and move on. You get the point. 
- I am not rushing through the day to get to the night where I can start drinking on the couch. I enjoy the day and do things. I still relax with TV at the end of the night. I usually watch one or two episodes of something. That's my down time. And I watch a lot less trash because it was only the wine I drank with it that interested me. 
- Awesome body composition, way less fine lines and wrinkles, brighter eyes
- Digestion is... I guess it hasn't been this good ever. 
- I exercise a lot and my heart health/VO2 is rated excellent (according to fitbit lol)
- I am in general just calmer and contented. I feel like I look forward to things more rather than catastrophizing them (and anyone in active anxiety episodes know how scary and paralyzing this can get)
- I don't feel bad about not staying at a party for eight hours and getting wasted. I am confident that showing up is enough. If I want to leave after an hour or three, that's perfectly normal and welll within my right.
 


CONS
- I am having trouble finding a vacation spot that isn't alcohol forward. I really think it's quite boring to sit on a beach all day, so watching other people get wasted isn't really my bag anymore
- I still sleep in a lot. I struggle to get up before 8 a.m. (Yes, I work but the office is close and I dont have kids to drop off at school). This is probably a separate issue but I thought id be one of those people who gets a jump on the day at 5 a.m., and that is not the case. ;)

This community has been amazing in keeping me grounded and reminding me what I'm aiming for and why I never want to go back to the way things were. I dealt with so much self-hatred, selfishness, and side-effects due to alcohol until I finally talked to my PCP exactly a year ago today. 

She prescribed me Naltrexone, and while I know not everyone is down for meds, it saved my life. I didn't take it the whole year, but it was what I needed to get me started and, placebo or not, control the urges. I'm beyond impressed with those of you who have quit on your own, but if you're struggling to do so, there's no shame in getting a little assistance.

It hasn't always been an easy year...PAWS/anhedonia are a hell of a thing, and quitting weed as well (which I abused even more thoroughly than alcohol) certainly didn't make things easier. That being said, my life is immeasurably improved. My marriage, my parenting, my professional life, my relationships with my friends, my health...all so much better. 

I say all this not to brag (I'm still crap at self-promoting and viewing myself positively), but in hopes of reassuring/encouraging those who are at the beginning of the process, considering/trying to quit, and/or in the grips of PAWS (so to speak).

I tried googling about this, but all I found was talk of heightened negative emotions and inability to feel joy.

Thoughts/experiences? 

Edit: I should add that over my years of drinking, I found that most of my emotional processing would only happen with alcohol in my system, like sober-me would always pass the job of grieving to drunk-me.

When I don’t drink, I’m miserable because I become isolated, pent up and bored. I’m honestly not sure which state I prefer. My identity is tied up with the party boy persona I’ve had for almost a decade, and the sad fact is that without it I don’t really know who I am or who my friends are. 

I should mention I’m not an alcoholic in the sense of daily drinking. I can go days without drinking and not require it. Yet I definitely have a problem. 

I am a binge drinker to the extreme, and at 34 years old I really feel like the party should be over - yet my binge drinking is probably worse than ever, and the way I feel afterwards almost certainly is. 

Almost every weekend going out for a drink with my friends turns into a some kind of bender, and all the other bad decisions follow (smoking, drugs, etc). My decision making and rational thinking goes out the window, and all I want to do is push the night on as far as possible and forget all sense of responsibility. 

When I’m intoxicated, I finally get to say what is on my mind. I finally get to tell the people I love that I love them. I finally get to talk about things I keep bottled up inside most of the time. I get a little break from living in my head and get to be who I want to be. And the fact that this is still the case at my age is just pitiful. 

I’m also single, so I feel the need to be very socially active to increase my chances of meeting someone, and alcohol has always been the most reliable tool for me when it comes to this. This flawed thinking has been reinforced by the fact I have had most dating success when under the influence. 

For a while I’ve been seeing the impact this behaviour is having on my life, yet I haven’t found true motivation to stop. My brain always tells me that sober life just isn’t for me. I work a lot at weekends, so often go in sleep deprived and hungover, which to my misfortune I’m getting quite good at. 

I lose multiple days of the week to this reckless behaviour and the recovery period, and then wonder why I feel like I’m not getting anywhere in life. And I’m truly tired of being angry and disappointed with myself about this. 

I know it needs to stop, but when I stop drinking I don’t feel any happier. The sober periods of my life have always been objectively more lonely, boring and serious. I know it shouldn’t be like this, but at this point I’m struggling to see a life beyond this habit.

1q79xkm,why i drank,"for most of my life i’ve struggled with poor self control. not being able to start things, not being able to maintain healthy habits, giving up when it gets hard. 

alcohol became a way to not only escape the feelings of guilt and shame this brought me, but also a way to lean into being out of control. once i was drunk, i didn’t have to try anymore. and it gave me a perverted sense of relief to not even have the ability to engage in the struggle of self-betterment. it removed the internal conflict and also quietened the voice in my head that wanted more from life.

deep down, i knew what was happening, but on the surface, i told myself that alcohol was a useful tool. that it could actually help me achieve things. the dopamine boost it gave me empowered me to do things like chores and cooking meals, and i refused to dwell on what it meant that i had created a life where i needed to be under the influence of a neurotoxin to clean my room or enjoy time with my family.  

it was almost like i was rebelling against myself. i resented the part of me that wanted better. i poured myself drink after drink, and giving into the daily numbness felt like acceptance. it allowed me to accept my identity as the person who quits when things get hard.

i’m now in the early days of abstinence. and sobriety means having to battle with those old impulses everyday. but sobriety also means that every day that i don’t drink, i am achieving something big. i still have other goals that i can’t yet bring myself to work on. more active goals that require more effort. but ‘not drinking’ means that every single day, even if i take zero active steps towards any of those other goals, i have still completed a task that day. a task that i have not been able to complete for 99% of my days over the last several years. and this task is the thing that’s going to help me slowly be able to achieve all those other goals too.

At first I would, like anyone, drink socially but with Covid and everything it became more habitual. I would constantly drink alone and black out probably about 7/10 times, usually taking around 5 shots and drinking 5 tall cans of either Smirnoff or even four lokos everyday. I’ve been a pretty big drinker since and would drive out of pure will just to get home, I’m not proud of it at all and thankfully I’ve very very luckily never got into an accident or pulled over. Jokes would be made about how much I drink but I never really took it into consideration of what was actually being said. I never really thought it was too much of a problem until I’d hear about the way I was acting towards others. They would tell me that I would become pretty much a completely different person in a really bad way and it hurt to hear those things. The thing that really pushed me to sobriety was hearing from my girlfriend of two years about how I would be and treat her. She has been nothing but perfect to me and always there to take care of me but she couldn’t take it anymore after constantly telling and asking me to slow down. It finally came to me in a big fight we had on the 29th, while I of course was drunk, that ended up with me telling her we needed a break. When I woke up the next day barely recollecting what had happened I spoke with her and she told me what I had said to her and how it made her feel and to me that was what pushed me to try to get sober. I didn’t think my drinking was a big problem, until it would become constant and affect my relationships with people close to me.

So after a long talk with her and luckily for me her being there to support me, I decided to make it a New Year’s resolution to become sober, not just for the year but forever. I am so happy that I’ve made the decision and my biggest challenge was of course New Years Eve.

1q767q7,Can’t Stop,"
I’m 38 this year and have had a bad relationships with alcohol/substance abuse since I was around 20. I’ve never been a daily drinker, it’s always been a massive binge/blow out every 3 weeks or so. Over the last few years these binges have got more and more out of control to a point where I barely recognise myself. My morals, pride and respect and care for others has just gone and I feel like an empty soulless shell.

Over the past 5 years or so I’ve tried to get sober numerous times in AA. I’ve had quite a few periods of 4/5 months sober before relapsing. 

I find it really hard to explain but I really struggle under the weight of being sober in AA. Thoughts start running through my head like “I’m not an alcoholic,” “I can’t keep speaking in these meetings,” “I can’t keep checking in with someone I barely know and asking them to organise my life,”. I really struggle with the thought that and feeling that powerless and need direction and guidance from other people. To the outside world I’m sober and being a responsible person, and the person I have always wanted to be, but inside I feel this massive pressure that I’m not living my own life and this constant urge to push back. I feel like I’m in a prison in my own head.

After another relapse a few days ago everything is telling me to get back to AA. The accountability seems to be the only thing that can keep me sober for a period of time, but I just can’t face this whole cycle again. I am suicidal thinking about it all. 

I’ve honestly got no idea what do from here but my life is going down the drain.

At first, I noticed that I had cravings every time I had discomfort or anxiety. using different types of meditation, I slowly saw that anxiety and discomfort was the reason I had been self medicating for so much of my adult life. I set about understanding and healing the anxiety by letting it be there & feeling like it was never going to go away. I used hypnosis to heal some trauma that had occurred when I was 18, right before I started drinking unhealthily. month 2-3 felt awesome. month 4-6 I had energy to focus on big goals that took a lot of visibility and sustained vision. month 7-9 i felt kind of awful. anxiety, boredom, the feeling that life was meaningless, I was alone, I had no spark and I was washed up, ugly, alone.  then month 10-12, I confronted long standing issues with friends- courageously becoming honest and being ok if  am unliked. my people pleasing tendencies started to melt. the holidays kicked up some anxiety, but I was able to see it & let it be (observe myself clearly). 

this is the first tome I’ve been sober from alcohol without using cannibus or other things. It’s not perfect, I haven’t really lost weight.

First, thank you so much for welcoming me into such a supportive and positive space! I’m facing a challenge and I’m wondering if others who have been in a similar situation could share their insights. I did search for similar posts, but see this hasn’t been discussed much recently. 

So this is day seven of not drinking for me. There are times in the past that I’ve taken a break from drinking before (for a few months at a time). I also have a long history of eating disorders (specifically anorexia) starting about twenty years ago, but I’ve been largely in recovery for the past few years. 

What I’m finding now, and found the last time I took a break from drinking about a year and a half ago, is that when I stop drinking my weight drops very quickly and my focus on controlling my food intake increases significantly. I think part of the problem is that a significant portion of my calories was coming from beer, and I just don’t have the appetite to replace those calories with food, which is causing significant weight loss, which is triggering my eating disorder. Right now, it’s not a serious problem, but I am recognizing the beginning of a pattern that I want to stop. 

Can anyone else relate? Does anyone have strategies for coping? I know that both problematic drinking and eating disorders are bad, so I’m really trying to avoid switching back and forth between problematic coping mechanisms and I’m hoping to see how other people have handled this.

I want to go to a place where nothing else matters and I can be 18 again (I’m only 23 to be fair). I get all worked up about sobriety when I’m hungover or watching my home fall apart. 

But my heart screams “Why can’t I dick around my apartment and have a tall boy? Why can’t I have a bath with a martini? Why can’t I spend every night after work dancing around by myself?” and I KNOW why. I know these habits are childish too. I can’t pull myself to fully understand why. Even when I finally do, it’s not long before I have another impulsive emotional day and it’s all over. 

Sometimes, even worse, when I get s\*\*c\*dal, it’s “harm reduction”. I absolutely cannot make plans to do it for the sake of friends and family, so a drink feels like the “next best” thing. 

Where do I get the strength to commit to something so hard when I can’t keep the goal in my mind?

I’m a night time, after work, after my son goes to bed drinker and definitely would binge on weekends. I work a highly emotionally stressful job and the holiday season was the worst for that. But I can’t use that as a crutch, especially as I’m getting older.

I feel okay, though. Not fuzzy in the mornings despite getting less hours of sober sleep.

Before starting that medication I was in college and even being in a fraternity I could go to parties and the clubs and just have a couple drinks and be perfectly content and go home at a reasonable hour.

After starting it towards the end of my college career, I suddenly drank a lot more whenever I did go out and would come home and continue to drink more until I passed out. I also would use cocaine on occasion, something that I had been around quite a bit but never had any interest in partaking in before starting this medication.

My doctor mentioned that this is something that is documented in literature. They immediately gave me a taper plan, and I just recently finished it and have noticed the cravings go completely away.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink.*  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good Morning DCI!  

It’s **Thankful Thursday**!

A gratitude practice is something I’ve already mentioned and initially resisted, but have found to be really rewarding.  It’s so important to focus on the good - no matter how small.

A few things I’m frequently thankful for are quiet mornings, good sleep, hot coffee, and a clear conscious.  Today I’m thankful for a safe business trip Tuesday/Wednesday, good meeting, and being back home! I’m grateful to be working for an incredible company and although I was salty about driving nearly 8 hours in two days for a 4 hour meeting, it was worth it and nice to see everyone. I’m also truly grateful for this sub. It’s seen me through my share of stumbles and lifted me up each and every time with no judgement. It has been absolutely pivotal in my success. 

Let’s lift each other up and share what we’re grateful for!

While we’re at it, please consider hosting.  This week has been incredibly fulfilling and you never know if something you’ve been through can help others feel less alone.  Reach out to me or sainthomer to arrange to be a host!

What’s something that sobriety has given you?

Someone or something that you’re thankful for today?

1q6zt4a,A stream of consciousness entry from day 9,"As the title says- I feel like week 1 went by relatively easily. No real white-knuckling, no wishing I could chain myself to a bed before getting possessed by the phantom of alcoholism. 

Yesterday was easy, too- I had some urges and thoughts and plans early in the day, but I was able to come to my senses with relative ease and rest easy at night. I don’t know why, but tonight it’s become impossible to not spiral into obsession. All I want to do is to drink- in my head it’d be the cure for my insane brain fog, my boredom, it’d be a way to “ween off easy” and help the urges down the line(a fantasy, a lie I tell myself.) 

God I can’t even count the amount of times I’ve tried to stop drinking. This is further than I usually get, and about 3 years ago I made it a full month. Since that month I don’t remember ever trying so hard, ever feeling like I had a clear path forward. That month was my first real go of it all. 

I don’t know what came over me to try and stop drinking again. I’m in a weird position in life. My job’s going great- honestly better than I ever could have hoped or dreamed for myself. I have a fantastic relationship with my partner of 8 or so years. I have friends and community unlike I’ve ever had. By all means I should be finding myself in an easy spot- it should be easy to quit. 

After that month three years ago, I never told anyone I started drinking again. I stopped going to recovery dharma and AA meetings. I started living this strange double life, the day life and the night life. In the day life I was acing classes and working 3 jobs at once. In the night life I was drinking myself to oblivion, amongst other unsavory self-harm actions. And it never really changed, and I never really told anyone that it never really changed. And I always thought I was filling some vast hole within myself when I drank. I always thought, well, once things improve and once I finally get the good life, then I’ll have no reason to drink. 

And now things have improved- i’m living the life I’ve always wanted to live, except for in the night time, when things are the same, when things are shrouded in a secret only I know.

Alcoholism is a disease, and I feel like I have something inherently fucked up in the structure of my brain that endlessly pairs me to it. The cycle repeats. 

I thought I was doing so well this time- that the time had finally come to stop, that sobriety would fit like a glove. And here I am typing this, whiling away the minutes while my brain feels like hot garbage and my thoughts spin around my head like a bad acid trip. 

I don’t know if I’ll be able to not drink tonight. I have to go pick up some zyns- I’m fresh out. When I’m at the store, will I be able to stop myself? There’s a bar underneath my work. I fantasize about ducking in before my rational brain can stop myself, getting a sense of normalcy before I can regret it.

1q6z52p,"Anyone experience a ""Divine Bolt"" after Stopping?","I was an alcoholic 6 months ago. Not severe, yet enough that alcohol was causing me to give up on my dreams and sucking my soul away. It was a friend, that gave me comfort, but kept me stuck in some cycle of misery and numbness.

After two weeks or so after stopping, I felt a shock as I was walking along a normal trail. What others define as divine intervention, something alike to being blessed by Zeus to or an encounter with an angelic figure. This was not at all hallucinatory or religious, rather purely emotional, and , purely a spiritual lightning bolt!  It was like I had been born again, a euphoria not achievable by the strongest of drugs. I cannot describe it with words. This event singlehandedly changed my life.

Afterwards, I've developed a strong sense of purpose and direction. I started my own company, blissfully work at my full time job, and I reconnected with a prior girlfriend who I loved dearly before departing across the world and we're together. My life is filled with activities, friends, hobbies, dreams of my brighter future, and it is truly wonderful in comparison to my prior life of living on the sidelines with my old buddy.  
  
I steer my life with a confidence gifted from this spiritual experience.

What i noticed now that tonight is the first night where I notice the symptoms of stopping for five days. I am very active and it's the late night already and I have to work tomorrow.

It was a rough year. Lost my mom to cancer (fuck cancer) and it happened fast. I was laid off a few months ago and am struggling to find another job. At no point, somehow, did I crave or miss drinking; when I thought about drinking it was in relief that I wouldn’t fall into a drunk abyss.

I’ve been very lucky in that regard — I know many folks here struggle every day with that, and for reasons beyond my understanding that hasn’t happened to me. It really was almost like a switch was flicked 3 years ago.

It hasn’t all been easy, though. I continue to struggle with problems I used to ignore (and often exacerbated) by drinking.  I carry guilt from some of my behavior and I struggle with my self-image. I am much more conscious of my behavior and how I (deliberately or otherwise) treat others. Then there’s the ADHD and anxiety, which is very disruptive and which definitely played at least a partial role in being laid off.

It was, frankly, a brutal year. And the 5 or so before it were no picnic either. I’m firmly middle-age now and I guess things often get difficult around this time.

But I’m not drinking, and that’s fucking huge.

1q6xmmx,Vanity post: Those of you who are frustrated by lack of weight loss & physical improvements in early sobriety,"I’ve been sober for 61 days. I was consistently working out before I quit. Since then, I’ve continued to lift weights and eat in a calorie deficit (high protein & balanced macros), and I looked and felt WAY WORSE after I quit. The scale didn’t move (seemingly defying the laws of physics bc I wasn’t gaining a ton of muscle), I was MORE bloated, my face and eyes looked yucky, and I had zero energy.

I’m at two months now. And things are JUST NOW moving in the right direction. Starting to lose weight slowly. And the bloating and inflammation has finally started to dissipate.

F33, daily vodka drinker.

Eyes: 4 weeks to begin to sparkle / whiten

Hair: 2 weeks to stop losing in clumps in the shower / brushing, 3 weeks for dandruff to go away, 4 weeks to not feel incredibly dry and tangly

Skin: 1 week to begin to rehydrated/firm up, although dehydration is still a struggle (I honestly don’t know how I survived on such little water before)

Face: 5 weeks to BEGIN to lose some inflammation, 6 weeks to start to look like myself again

Belly: 8 weeks and is just now started to debloat

Weight: 8 weeks to START tipping the scales in the right direction

Hopefully my timeline helps some of you keep the path. Because sometimes it gets worse before it gets better. And de-pickling yourself in your 30s is a lot harder and time consuming than in your 20s. And I’d imagine much much more as decades go on. It’s been hard for me to let go of the external and focus on the internal healing, but that really is the most importantly part of this journey. Physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. The physical benefits are a pretty great bonus though!

Went to the doctor today and she said I should probably take like 3 months off of drinking and that it’s either a gallbladder or liver issue even though nothing popped up in the scan.

1q6vg27,I’m 23 and can’t stop leaning on alcohol.,"I suppose I am just here looking for support. 

I started drinking heavily about a year ago, and originally it would be with friends or when I was going out. But now, I am able to down a bottle of liquor in a day.. by myself. My tolerance for alcohol is extremely high, and I KNOW I need to stop the drinking. In high school, I relied on weed. My tolerance for THC also increased dramatically. But drinking made me feel “different.” Smoking can be nice, but the feeling alcohol gives me is much more of a “release,” if you will. 

I hate the way alcohol makes me feel. I hate it. I feel nauseous, bloated, shameful, and then when I’m sober, all of the issues I’ve been suppressing come rushing back. In fact, I can’t STAND being sober. Whenever I get home from work, I want to drink immediately. Even on days that I get off at 2. For a while, I was in a cycle where I would work, come home, get drunk, fall asleep until 11 at night, shower and maybe eat, go to bed, then repeat the next day. But that temporary release has been completely hooked, and despite my desire to quit, I also don’t know how to stop that urge. Even if I’m trying to distract myself with something productive, that voice in my head keeps saying, “man.. I would love to be drinking right now.”

I’m definitely good at masking my drinking problem. I am a 4.0 student in college, about to graduate with my degree. I am a supervisor at my job, I have healthy friendships, and I just got into graduate school. But when I’m alone, I just feel like a fraud. Like I don’t really have my shit together like everyone thinks I do.

1q6uq82,2 years of Sobriety,"I’m so proud of myself! I went from drinking till I was blacked out, passed out, or sick every single night for a decade. 1/7/24 I picked myself off the floor between the hallway & bathroom next to my puke. I looked around & was absolutely disappointed & disgusted with myself. Sure I held my job, kept food in the house & a roof over our heads. Cleaned myself up everyday & kept a semi clean home but I would drink till I passed out every night. What a waste of life. I quit cold turkey at 5am 2 years ago. Got my butt off the floor & poured any alcohol I had out. 

I spent 2 days at home with the shakes, extreme anxiety, sick before I returned to work. I read this subreddit, got on a couple sober apps, watched tv to take my mind off of the shake’s & anxiety. Went to work (I work in the industry) & thought if I can’t stay sober cause of work, I’ll quit. I was done with the poison. Hard candies on hand seemed to help. THEN, I made it to my 1st personal milestone 4 FRIGGING DAYS!! That was huge to me. Then a week! I was kind to myself & allowed myself to eat what & when I wanted, rested as much as I needed for the first month. I was so nervous on my days off, I started to deep clean everything I could to pass the time. When I was done with that I picked up old hobbies & try some new ones. That first year of sobriety I focused on staying away from alcohol & getting a routine.

1q6ugv4,Dry Januaryists- Day 7… the second arrow,"When life feels difficult, I like to lean on a Buddhist parable about ""The Two Arrows.""

The story goes that a man is walking down the street and is struck by an arrow. It’s painful. But then, a moment later, he is struck by a second arrow in the exact same spot.

The first arrow represents the things in life we cannot control—the bad day at work, a flat tire, a cold, or a difficult conversation. It’s the initial pain of being human.

The second arrow is our reaction to the first. 

In my past, when the first arrow hit me, my ""second arrow"" was almost always a bottle. I would take a bad situation and choose to make it worse by adding a hangover, anxiety, and shame to the original problem. I was essentially shooting myself with that second arrow every single time life got hard.

Today, when events are against me, I know what my second arrow could be. But I am learning to sit with the pain of the first arrow without doubling the damage. I choose not to make a bad day worse by drinking.

I’ve realised that I can’t always stop the first arrow from landing, but I can control whether or not I fire the second one.

1q6ua5h,"For people who have experienced numerous relapses, what's kept you going?","Topic question, but thought I'd provide context on how bad and frequent my relapses have been.   
  
I started my sobriety journey June of 2024, got into a Kaiser program after going to the ER and stayed sober pulling out all the stops, managed to save by job by the hair of my teeth. Had a major screw up in NYC in October 2024. I had another spiral shortly thereafter beginning of December 2024, and then went to the ER again (none of these visits were 100% necessary but I desperately wanted to feel better and get myself fixed up sooner rather than later). From there, I had an amazingly good stint from December 2024 through June 2025. Things were looking good. 

Then I started letting things slip, I started allowing myself a drink here and there at work parties, at outings with friends, etc. etc. Fast forward to Halloween 2025 and I was basically calling out of sick for all of the following week due to just drinking my brain to mush. I went to the ER once more and thought I was good but, I was still giving myself (even after that event) allowances here and there. Finally came to a head these last few days and it was a thing where I was hiding all my drinking from my wife. I finally decided enough was enough and I needed to tell her the truth.  
  
She was incredibly understanding and supportive but very very reasonably upset, she said of course if this were to happen again she'd need to get both our families involved to sort things out. She said her brain was having questions to herself about 'what if me and Matt needed to separate for a time' and 'what it Matt wasn't allowed to live here for a time', and said things for both our lives would be objectively worse if this happened again in the way it did.   
  
I went to the ER yesterday for most of the day and I'm feeling reasonably better again, I've barely eaten anything since Saturday so that's a big reason I needed to get some help. I reached out to my psychiatrist to look into vivitrol injections since I haven't been good about taking my naltrexone regularly in recent months (though I was the first half of 2025), I signed up for a weekly group again, started reading Allen Carr's book, using Reframe, and making weekly therapy appointments after contacting my therapist about what happened. I'm also starting back posting here and lurking regularly cause I felt too ashamed before but this subreddit helps me a lot. 

My question, I'm feeling low on myself for making so many frequent relapses in such a short span of time, but also in not a short span of time since this has been happening over the course of 2 years. What keeps you going when you're really feeling hopeless, like you've already failed so many times despite accessing professional and medical help and social support? If I hadn't been accessing any actual resources, these relapses would feel different, but because they still have happened despite all that, it feels like an even greater dose of shame and guilt since I should fucking know far far better by now.

Really I'm wondering about internal vs. external motivation. The worst thing that alcohol has done for me, is how it has made life pass me by, and now even though I'm still close with my family, and my friends are still my friends, I feel like everyone else moved on while I'm standing still.

I have read a lot of success stories in this sub and elsewhere, and in many of those, the people telling them had reached a point far worse than I ever have, including permanently strained relationships and permanent damage to their bodies, and they still ended up with happy, normal lives after quitting drinking. I should be happy about still being relatively in control, but maybe due to the lack of that very obvious bad thing that wouldn't have happened if I didn't drink, it is harder to convince myself that my life will be better without alcohol. I haven't ""ruined"" anything, I just don't have anything to say when family members or friends ask me what I've been up to recently. Perhaps they have noticed that, I do not know. And many of my current friends I actually got to know while we all drinking heavily — when it was ""okay"" because we were all young university students — they just were able to keep it moderate once that period of life passed, while I kept drinking even on my own, sometimes to take the edge off anxiety and sometimes just out of sheer boredom.

My drinking over the past 4/5 months never got as bad as it was before, but I was drinking wayyy more than I should have. 

I went to the doctor and then got back on Naltrexone a few days ago. As of now, I really don’t have any desire to drink. I know it’s not what I want for myself. However, I’ve been smoking every day since and eating a ton of junk. I guess I’m just worried I’m swapping out one addiction for another. There was a point toward the end of college where I was smoking every single day and was addicted to the feeling/mental escape/laziness it gave me. I don’t want to go back to that, but I also don’t want to go back to drinking. 

Does anyone have advice for how to not fall into another addiction while stopping this one? I’m giving myself some grace this first week with smoking/food because I know it’s better than drinking, but I also know it will hurt my body in different ways if I do this daily.

The meeting was a normal one, but I remember the chairperson closing out. He finished the meeting with a short story.

He told us how years ago, in his early sobriety, he attended a huge sober event. People from all over the state came. There was a meeting specifically for people who had decades of sobriety (though anyone could attend).

One guy had over half a century of sobriety. Our chairperson grabbed him after the meeting and asked him basically ""In 50 years, what's the most important thing you have learned to stay sober?""

The chairperson expected a long lecture, a life history, a grand speech.

He said the old biker dude simply looked at him, smiled and said:

1q6q5a6,I didn’t expect sobriety to change how time feels,"One thing I didn’t expect after getting sober was how different time would feel.

Drinking used to blur everything together.
Nights disappeared.
Weekends passed without much memory of them.
Time felt fast and slow at the same time.

When I stopped drinking, days felt longer.
Evenings felt stretched out.
There was more space than I knew what to do with.

At first, that made me uncomfortable.
I thought something was wrong.
Like life was supposed to feel more exciting than this.

What I see now is that nothing was missing.
Time wasn’t empty.
It was finally mine.

I started noticing routines.
Patterns.
Small choices that actually mattered.

Sobriety didn’t give me more time.
It gave me awareness of it.

1q6q53v,This is not for everyone but it might be for you: quitting drinking has been way easier and better than I expected it to be,"I hope that framing doesn’t minimize the struggles that anyone else has experienced, but the reason I put it that way is that it accurately describes my experience, and I hope that it might nudge someone in the right direction or allay some fears they may have about attempting to curb or stop their drinking.

I’ll skip to the end here first so that no one has to wade through the rambling that may come:

\-A regular night for me would involve a cocktail or two at home around 9, a cocktail or two out, 4 or 5 beers or a pitcher of beer, and 2-4 beers at home before going to bed around 2 or 3 AM… this was generally 3 to 5 nights per week… a lighter night at home would be a cocktail or two, and 3 to 6 beers, which would be most other nights of the week. I probably averaged 1 night of not drinking per week.

\-The biggest thing that pushed me to stop was increasing amounts of intense anxiety the next day, as well as the feeling that I was shortchanging my kids, being hungover all the time

\-I thought it was going to be hard and scary, and that maybe even I might need to detox medically, but the feeling of satisfaction of making it another day was a bigger reward than I anticipated, and physical withdrawal symptoms, luckily, never surfaced in a way I noticed or recognized, though I did feel unexpectedly tired and lethargic during the first week… it seems like this may not always be the case for everyone, but this was my experience

\-I wasn’t sure how to plan to deal with cravings, but what has worked for me was having a plan for the night (I was a night drinker), even small plans… once again, the feeling of reward from not drinking was typically enough to ignore cravings, and they have subsided almost completely, though I recognize that every day is a new day

\-My entire social life revolved around drinking, and it turns out I can keep doing what I was doing without drinking.

\-I liked to swim for exercise, so now I do more of that, and really try to hold myself accountable to it most days

\-I liked to play darts in bars with my buddy, so I still do that, but now I ask the bartenders for a pitcher with 90% soda water and 10% cranberry juice, and be sure to tip $5 or $10 for it even though it’s free

\-The friend I play darts with was also interested in cutting back, so we’ve been in this together… this has probably been 10x more valuable than I could ever fully appreciate

\-I’ve always made music, so I have really dug into some of the more technical aspects of this hobby with my downtime

\-I try to carve out some time every day, a few times a day ideally, to just notice how I am feeling, describe it to myself (mentally), and decide whether anything indicates if there is an action I need to take

\-My wife says I seem to “better”

\-One of my sons noted that I have been “less grumpy,” while kindly clarifying that it’s not that I was not always grumpy before, but that I am “especially un-grumpy” now

I last had a drink on October 25th, 2025. Prior to that, I’d only made one earnest attempt ever to pause my drinking (I stopped for around 3 or 4 months during the pandemic after some health anxiety about my liver). Over the past few years, I’d begun to experience increasingly debilitating episodes of anxiety and panic during hangovers. I’ve had anxiety my whole life, so I thought I knew how to manage the issue, but eventually it became more than I knew how to deal with. I knew this for a while before I decided it was time to address it. I’d recently begun therapy, and my therapist was alarmed at how frequent and intense these episodes could get. For whatever reason, he never seemed to want to discuss my drinking as a causal factor in my anxiety. It might have been because I have had some adverse experiences as a child that seemed like more pressing therapeutic concerns, or any number of other things that could be my issues or his, but it was a big gap in working out my shit.

I can now say without a doubt that more than 90% of the anxiety that I was experiencing could be directly tied to how much I’d had to drink the night before. It’s not completely gone, but I now experience just a very small sliver of the dread, fear, panic, and physical symptoms that I had been experiencing before stopping drinking. The anxiety that I do experience now is actually useful and productive because I can see it as a signal that my brain and body are trying to tell me something that I’m either ignoring or not noticing.

I’m a 44 year old guy. I’d been a mostly daily drinker, usually a binge drinker, for around 20 years. I used to do music stuff in clubs for a living, traveling internationally, and booze and drugs were around everywhere, for free, all the time. I had a ton of fun, and while I do think it fucked up my trajectory as someone who could make a living being creative, the only thing I really regret is that it set me on a path towards appetites that could simply never be satisfied.

I quit drugs a long time ago, but with alcohol, there was never enough. I drank to have fun, I drank to bond with others, I drank to avoid boredom, I drank to avoid pain and thinking, and I drank because I drank. I got away with it for so long because I was pretty good at keeping my shit together and not letting it affect my job or life in ways that were obvious to anyone but my wife. Whenever I’d bring up that I might have a problem, most people other than my wife would insist that I’m just a fun guy who likes to party. I was a happy drunk, and I’d stay up with you til whenever you wanted to end the night, talking about whatever you’d want to talk about. My wife was primarily concerned about the potential health consequences of my drinking, the amount of money I’d spend going out, and sometimes annoyed (or worse) that I’d frequently choose drinking, and hence be party guy, rather than appreciate small, quiet moments together.

I’d actually cut back a bit in recent years, though still drank Herculean amounts compared to normal humans. I’ve never been a day drinker, but since becoming a dad 13 years ago, I’ve kept drinking as a thing I do after the kids go to bed. It’s not that it was a secret so much as that it was sort of my thing, on my time. In some way, I think drinking felt like it gave me ownership of my time. I didn’t realize for too long how much of my time and energy it was actually stealing. Between the racing, circular thoughts of my daily anxiety, the laziness of hangovers, the diminished mood, and the sort of hungry ghost-feeling of waiting to drink, rather than actively experiencing ordinary moments… It often felt like there was some other me who didn’t give a shit about some of the most important things in life. Some part of me that convinced myself that drinking-me was more alive than sober-me.

I woke up on the 25th of October knowing that that night would be my last time drinking for a while. I don’t think I mentioned it to anyone. I didn’t want to jinx it, or have to justify why I was drinking again the next night, or the next week. But inside, I knew I was ready and I felt like I could do it. The first week, I had “sobriety fatigue.” I was mentally foggy and constantly tired. A few nights in, my buddy asked me if I wanted to go play darts. I was nervous about it. I wondered if it would be fun sober. I wondered if the bartender would be annoyed that i wasn’t drinking. It turns out it was fun and the bartender was stoked on our behalf, and my buddy didn’t want to drink either. And then in the second week, I noticed that my swim times were improving significantly, and that felt great. I noticed that I was sharper in meetings, or at least I felt a bit less dumb than I’d become used to feeling. I noticed how much fun bed time with my kids had become again, because I wasn’t experiencing it as the last hurdle to get through before I could make a drink. I felt more creative while making music. I felt more patient while watching movies. 

Overall, everything felt better. And it was easy. I almost feel bad to say it because of the harrowing stories I’ve read here and elsewhere, and heard from addicts throughout my life, but it’s true. It just hasn’t been that hard, and it’s felt great. I fully recognize that I may be an edge case, but I know that there are probably others who will find that stopping drinking is not the big scary thing they’ve made it out to be.

When I took my first pause a few years ago it was because of health anxiety, which I’m still prone to. There was a bit of that fueling my ultimate decision to stop. I know what the risks are, and my body felt fucked up enough that I knew I was harming myself to some unknown degree. I’m establishing care with a new primary care doctor at the end of the month. The last time I had bloodwork done was in 2021, and things were fine then. But I recognize that time takes its toll. I’m hopeful that my numbers will be good. I feel good. But whatever happens, I’m on the best path forward.

I still feel a bit silly saying that I’ve stopped drinking forever. Maybe it just feels too big to say. But my wife asked me, a few weeks in, how long I would like for this pause to be, and my response was something like, “Life would have to give me a pretty big reason to start drinking again. I can’t really think of what that would be. I don’t think it would be anything good.” One reason the idea of quitting drinking used to bother me is that I’d imagine us traveling and having these big life moments, and whenever I’d done that previously, the vision I saw of those moments, I had a drink in my hand, in almost all of them. The idea of going to Italy and not drinking wine, or going to Ireland and not drinking a Guinness, they were just possibilities I didn’t want to consider. It felt melancholy, deprived, insufficient, even pathetic or defeated. Now when I think about those possibilities, I just imagine how good I might feel in the morning, and grateful, in advance, for the richness of life. I can’t think of anything that would be worth giving this up for, so I intend for it to be lasting.",1767816520.0,1,0,stopdrinking,substance

1q6ppe2,What could have been,"
I met up with my ex (we were together for 8 years) after 5 years apart today. High school sweethearts now both nearing 30. We had a horrible breakup but in all these years never lost contact. I’m moving abroad and we decided to meet. 

He ordered a beer. I’m on day 6 but this isn’t the first time I’ve quit (the longest was a year). He drank it quicker than I read the menu. 

He was really tense to begin with and then after the beer loosened up but was very elusive. I was so tempted to have a drink too. To loosen how I felt, to feel a bit of a buzz, to relax. But I realised I already felt those feelings. I felt kind of sad he needed a beer to.

We parted ways. The meeting was fine. No big revelations. Nice to see someone you used to care about doing ok. Also burst the nostalgia bubble that’s been brewing in my head all this time. He’s just a guy and I see why we broke up. 

If I’d had that drink and we didn’t continue at the restaurant together, I would’ve bought a carry out on the way home, or gone somewhere else. I would’ve drank alone. I would’ve gotten drunk. I would’ve messaged him, saying stuff that may or may not be true. I would’ve woken up tomorrow imagining a different version of what happened the day before. My emotions and dopamine would be out of whack. I would not be ok. 

He messaged after apologising for not being good company. I ignored it. He messaged a couple hours later saying a bit more. I’ve ignored that too. Not out of malice. I wonder if he carried on drinking. Maybe I will reply. Maybe I’ll leave it on read like so many people have done to me. All I know right now is I’m not sure so I won’t. 

I also want to sit with my sober thoughts and process, to breathe it in and let it out. To understand how I feel. To not go back to my old coping ways of numbing and then having the pain all hit me at once. 

It was weird. How that split decision between joining and leaving has left a completely different outcome. But you know what? I love this outcome. I went for a walk. I did some admin. I had a meal. I talked with my family. I’m having a bath next and reading then chocolate then bed then wake up tomorrow early and have a sunrise swim followed by coffee that doesn’t give me the jitters and a breakfast that doesn’t make me feel sick. I even felt uncomfortable and annoyed and kind of awkward and liked it! Like oh wow these feelings aren’t suppressed, they want no need to be felt! The other outcome would be a four pack x2, no food, messages, waking up unsure, regret, what can I remember, oh god I feel awful so I must feel awful about seeing him. Instead I get the truth kindly and assertively. 

It could be so different. Everything could be. I could still be with him and I’m not. And I didn’t realise how ok I was about that until he became real rather than a memory in my head. 

I could’ve had a drink and done things I wish I hadn’t. And instead I feel so at peace right now I can’t believe it. 

Next battle is the airport. But if I could do this today, I have a lot of faith in myself right now I can do it everyday.

For whatever reason, when I quit cold turkey, I had a couple of days of wonky sleep and then everything was fine. I understand how lucky I was that it went down that way.

Alas, nine months of sobriety, and then we bought a house. The sellers left us a bottle of champagne. Hey, why not celebrate? I'd been good for nine months.

When that didn't derail me, I started drinking on occasion. Maybe once a month, and probably 1 - 4 drinks. Then, I was back up to drinking, on average, once or twice a week. This led to a lack of motivation, and a couple of days a week that I would be tired. 

So, I quit again this past November.  And, even though I was nowhere near my previous level of drinking - not even close - this time my withdrawals are worse. Mind you, I can work, I feel like I get good sleep, and I'm exercising regularly. But my brain is at about 70% of where it should be in ""processing power,"" and by the end of the day, fighting the sluggishness exhausts me. I've also experienced some wild moments where I'd have to go to sleep after I exercised, even though it's the firs thing I do when I wake up.

Now I'm reading a bit about this, and see that it's a real possibility, even with moderate drinking, the more times you withdrawal, the worse your symptoms can be. So, yeah, lesson learned.

I believe I had a decent childhood, but most of my life I felt like the outsider looking in, barely fitting in with others. It made school and college very hard for me at times, but I still tried to make the best of every situation. Unfortunately, that meant subconsciously doing as much harm to myself as I could. I started watching porn at a super young age (thankfully stopped) and hung out with “friends” that bullied me relentlessly. And as I got older, I got into all sorts of substances over the years. The worst part? I wanted it. I wanted to be fucked up. I wanted to give up and go be with the other screwups. I was tired of my existence and felt better off dead. I live close to a rough part of my city and every day I drove through it during my drinking days I idolized the idea of wandering the streets wasted. I just didn’t care anymore, even when the good stuff/people started pouring in. It made the first couple years of my marriage difficult on my poor wife. And when I drank, I fucking drank. The man who was so against cracking a beer at 8AM became the man that was taking shots and getting drunk before 9AM. I drank so much because I think deep down I wanted to die and, in my mind, liquor was the “fun” way to go out.

I’m so ashamed of the person I became in my moments of weakness. I have an extremely hard time separating the past from my present. But I do know that I did the right thing getting sober. It’s just now I’m more aware of everything good and bad…and I’m struggling with the bad. I just know I have and continue to let myself down sometimes. I’m talking about moments where I could have said/done things differently and avoided hurting somebody. The senseless road rage I have. But it’s not all about that. I can’t stand seeing the sad shit I see on the Internet that makes me want to hug my loved ones/pets. I’m just so over the evil in this world. I don’t want people to be homeless or animals to be neglected. I don’t want to read another story of a kid losing his life to bullying or another deranged person destroying society for whatever dumbass purpose they have. I’m crying writing this because I have witnessed or experienced so many bad things for over 30 years and as much as I love being alive and I want to stay alive, my heart hurts so much for so many reasons.

I can’t change the person I was or control what happens to the world outside my influence, but I do know I need to push through the bad thoughts and continue working on what I can do to be a better person and contribute positively to society.

Today is the first day I'm really feeling weak.

I live with a spouse who if not narcissist has high narcissistic tendencies. We have small children and everyday after another its the same fighting, shouting (to me and kids) and life inside home is just terrible.

I try to keep peace and be nice but inside I pile up with hatred towards her. If I tell her, she cries and tella me im cruel. If i dont, i feel like im not protecting my children and setting boundaries. 

I just dont know what to do.

But this evening was one like most others. She has many temper tantrums, speaks despisefully to me (in front of children) and i just want to went out - alcohol used to be my go to thing during these emotional rollercoasters. But I dont want it to be like that anymore.

Its been only week, and im already feeling as i knew i would, that in this moments i just want to drink.

1q6obw8,Relapsed and I'm scared of myself.,"I relapsed on Monday and it was really bad. I drank nonstop for two days. Not eating, not sleeping, just drinking. I feel like I’m destroying my body and my life and I don’t know why I keep doing this to myself.

I completely freaked out on everyone I love. I said horrible things, overreacted, spiraled, and caused real damage — especially to my relationship. But the part that I can’t stop crying about is that my son saw me like that. He saw me unstable, emotional, not myself. I never wanted him to see this version of me and the shame is crushing.
When I drink I turn into someone I don’t recognize. I lose control so fast. I become reactive, angry, irrational, and then when it’s over I’m left sober, shaking, and staring at the wreckage wondering how I let this happen again.

I’m terrified of how quickly I spiral once I start. I’m terrified of what I’m modeling for my child. I feel like I’m ruining everything I care about and I don’t trust my own brain right now.

I’m sober today, but I’m scared. I hate that I’m back here. If anyone has come back from a relapse this intense — especially with kids involved — I really need to hear that it’s possible to repair the damage and actually stay sober.
I don’t want this life. I don’t want my son to remember me this way. I just needed to tell the truth somewhere. I'm slipping, FAST and I don't want to lose everything I care about.

I was a street kid. Most of GenX kind of were. I started smoking at 8 years old, and I was dealing meth at 12 years. I know it's hard to imagine for some people, but it was my reality. After working on myself, going to AA/ACA meetings, doing therapy, and all the other ""shadow work"", it was clear to see that anyone with my upbringing would have made the same decisions and ended up in treatment, and the decades of substance use I maintained. It takes two to make a prison, the prisoner and the jailor. And I was the jailor, I blamed THEM, and HER, and the SYSTEM! BUT! When I let THEM go, I was free to go, too. So, when I started looking back for the people who tried to help that poor kid, I could see their loving hearts and the times they tried. So, I called them all, I sent emails, I wrote letters, and I visited grave sites to thank the ones who cared and forgive the ones who couldn't.

1q6l207,7 days 10 hours—family reunion/flight this weekend,"Not worried about drinking. I’ve done dry January for about 10 years which have ended up in 45,50,60,100 day, 1 year + stints of sobriety. I have a lot of will power in January lol. But I know a family reunion and flight will be triggering since I always had a Bloody Mary before a flight and family is just triggering. 

It got me thinking about why I would want to drink during a family reunion like at that point I’m not escaping my family, or myself, I’m just buzzed or drunk and red eyed yet still anxious to socialize and be vulnerable. So what is the point of reaching for alcohol in that situation?

And I was thinking about the last time I was in that situation, just over a year ago. I was drunk at every event. I did not feel less anxious, just maybe supported by alcohol? Like it was a sidekick or friend. It didn’t make me anymore social or confident than I would have been because again I was still so anxious. But it was a comforting ally I could lean on in that situation. 

It didn’t help me escape myself or the room by any means. If anything it probably amplified that I have a disorganized drinking problem which is embarrassing in that context and provides just the type of gossip at a family reunion you don’t want to be identified with. But maybe it feels kind of like wearing armor or an invisibility cloak that makes me feel like they can’t judge or get to know the real me if the real me is not fully present and drowned a bit in poison. That isn’t me if that makes sense. It’s drunk me and for someone reason I regard her as a separate person from who I am…even though she’s just drunk me.

It will be interesting to see how this goes and confronting head on whatever it is I’m so afraid of and building a new brain pathway that can handle those situations dry. It will be interesting observing these events sober as well.

1q6kshw,Smoking weed,"Hey guys, 

I’ve been taking part in dry January (I actually started on December 28 because I got some sort of sinus infection) so it’s been 10 days for me now. Physically I feel great, emotionally there’s ups and downs but I guess that’s normal. That’s not what I wanted to talk about though.

I have a little weed pen that I’ve used a few times (only after dinner when gaming or watching a show/movie) and I was wondering if anyone considers that bad? Obviously being 100% sober is ideal to be more in tune with your emotions and signals your body sends, but like.. is it considered bad for a person to smoke weed while taking an indefinite break from drinking? 

I’m not sure if it makes a difference, but my intention when smoking is not to escape from feelings, if anything it heightens anything I’m feeling so if I’m not in a good mood I don’t use it. My intention is I guess to heighten the good fun feelings I get when gaming with my friends. Which is different than when I was drinking alcohol, it felt almost like the excuses were being made for me by my subconscious. Like “oh tomorrow’s Saturday, you can get blackout tonight” but with the weed I don’t have that feeling. I’m actually incredibly careful to not get too high.

1q6imk4,How do I know if I’m an alcoholic/have alcohol abuse issues?,"I began drinking at 15 years old, which was much earlier than most of my peers. I come from a family (and a group of family friends) that party often. Like really party, and fairly often. So, after I was caught passed out in my own vomit at 16, my dad began allowing me to drink at these functions with the intention of teaching me moderation under his supervision. 

From then on, any time I got too drunk at these parties, I’d have full on emotional breakdowns about whatever was happening in my life at the time - one new years it was because I wasn’t happy with my then boyfriend, another time it was because my older brother was moving away for work.

I definitely got some judgment from a few families because of this behavior, but for the most part, everyone else found it funny or endearing.

So I continued into college.

But soon, the emotional breakdowns became more angry than sad, depending on who I was with when they ensued. Any time I was too wasted around my then boyfriend, I would get angry with him about how he treated me. While I was justified in my feelings, the way that I conducted myself and the way that I communicated to him were hurtful. None of my friends ever saw this side of me, however. They all only saw the overly sensitive and sad version of my drunk self. So I told myself the reason I get so angry, only with that boyfriend, is because I’m unhappy in the relationship, so I soon left and once again carried on with this same behavior. 

Then came sophomore year of college, when I met my now boyfriend. He’s kind, caring, loving, and all of the best words to describe a partner. Everything was perfect that summer because my friends and I were working and separated. When fall semester started, things quickly started to go downhill. 

I would start drinking and never know when to stop. Sometimes at the pregames, I would throw up immediately after taking my first shot and I’d just come back out and try again. I wasn’t satisfied with tipsy, because that was “boring.” I didn’t like feeling drunk and then it wearing off by the time I got to the club, so I tried to overcompensate. 

Another thing to note is this is around the time where I became addicted to vaping, so I often had no appetite. So I’d go much of the day barely eating, but I knew I had to eat before drinking, so I’d scarf down one meal right before starting to pregame and think that would suffice.

It obviously did not. This led to a series of very drunk nights, almost always ending with my head in the toilet. Finally, one day, I went out with my friends and went completely overboard. I didn’t even make it into the club. I overheard some girl calling my friends and I losers in the line and immediately broke down. I was extremely angry and sad, and my friends had to take me back home. When I got there, my boyfriend was in my room waiting for me. This was my first time lashing out at him. For no apparent reason. 

I woke up the next morning remembering I was upset, but with no memory of how bad it really got. My boyfriend told me I randomly began yelling at him for ever dating anyone in the past and hitting myself in the head and calling myself a loser. My friends, outside in the living room, heard the entire thing. 

I was devastated that I hurt him and embarrassed that everyone witnessed me in that state. I couldn’t explain why I yelled the way I did or why I was as upset as I was. My boyfriend forgave me. 

But then it happened again. I would get too drunk, black out, and start an argument with him. Then I’d wake up with no memory of it. Some of the things he’d say I said have haunted me. I still don’t know why I did that; I love him and I’m extremely happy with him. He’s the person I always dreamed of ending up with. 

While I was regularly getting drunk, these occurrences would only happen 4-5 times a year, but would only ever be directed at him. 

A year and a half later, he graduated and began cutting out his college habits of drinking and smoking consistently. He moved back home while he worked and only visited a few times a month. This, of course, made my behavior seem even more extreme than before.

At this point, I was very rarely starting fights with him, but I was still getting so drunk to the point that I would be hungover and sat over the toilet the entire next day. This would happen at least once a month. Twice, I was throwing up/nauseous for multiple days afterwards. 

One time, on a trip to NYC, I was extremely exhausted from an early flight and the summer heat. I still drank because my friends and I were going out, and I got so drunk I started speaking in gibberish and became non-responsive. He was so scared for me that he called 911 and the paramedics showed up to our hotel room. I was fine and the paramedics left almost immediately, but that day really woke him up to what he was dealing with. He was scared for my health, and I was ashamed and also scared of my behavior. 

I told him I would never get like that again. 

But a month later came the first semester of my senior year of college. My friends and I were determined to make the most of it. For them, part of making the most of it was going out as much as possible. They don’t have the same issues that I do. 

At this point, my boyfriend had moved a few hours away for his new job. He didn’t want me to drink to that point ever again, simply because he cared about my health. But stupidly, I interpreted that as him not wanting it to be his problem to take care of anymore. I thought it was fine because he wasn’t going to be around for the most part. 

So I went back and started up the same habits again. I was more addicted to nicotine than ever, and I was eating just to drink the same way I did before. I’d wake up more hungover than all of my friends and not understand why. When I finally pinpointed what the issue was, I simply tried to eat a bigger meal before drinking rather than making any other lifestyle changes.

Eventually, this behavior spilled over to the weekends that he was visiting. It happened 5 times throughout the semester: 3 times while he was visiting, and one of those times I broke down at him saying I was afraid he was cheating on me. This was something I never felt while sober, yet talked so passionately about while black out drunk. 

He hit a wall. He didn’t know what more to say or do for me to stop engaging in this self-destructive behavior. He told me recently he was seriously going to break up with me. I honestly don’t know how he put up with me for this long, but him saying that shocked me into reality. I took him for granted for far too long, and I want to do whatever I can to fix my problems. 

So, I’m starting to make lifestyle changes. I quit vaping a month ago and have been working on eating regular meals. I saw a psychiatrist and have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and ADHD, which I’m starting therapy for soon. I’ve been away from the drinking scene because I’m on winter break, but my final semester of college starts in a week. 

My question now is, am I an alcoholic? Do I have some kind of alcohol abuse problem? Or is there a way for me to control my alcohol if I accompany it with healthy habits like eating properly and staying hydrated, things I never really did before? I want to have fun with my friends in our last few months in school together, and I know that they’re planning on going out even more than last semester, but I would rather stay sober if drinking means I’ll lose one of the most important people in my life.

I didn’t have any sweats, shakes, trouble sleeping, any of it but I didn’t have the urge that as soon as I was off work I’d get home and reward myself. Part of it always felt like “I’m an adult I can do what I want” so why not. It offered something water didn’t.  I do wake up feeling a little better like I can be more productive.  The problem being I don’t really always want to be. If I’m not working (travel for a living) I’m completely off. It might be a full week and I’m at home while all my friends are working. So that’s always been the hard part because again, you find yourself bored. Doing tasks around the house feels like I’m back in 2nd grade being handed busy work by the teacher we know serves no purpose so right now that’s the real struggle.

On day 3 I was looking for a reason to drink but told myself no because I’d told everyone at new years I’m doing dry January. Made me feel like I need to be accountable. After day 3 I haven’t had any urges. Doesn’t mean I wouldn’t want it but I can look at the bourbon and vodka sitting in my kitchen and walk past it. I guess right now at day 6 the thing I’ve noticed is there’s no craving for it. I kinda had hoped I’d have the sweats and other issues so I’d have felt a higher level of achievement like I’d really overcome something.  The hardest challenge hasn’t been any withdrawal but accepting that it doesn’t have to be part of my day.  I went from waking up at 2am sitting on the couch with a glass still in my hand to going to bed and knocking out and waking up in the morning ready to go, just no where to go to.  So I’m giving that time to adapt.

But is there anymore change coming? I wouldn’t mind losing a few lbs. I went from 198 to 222lbs during the peak of summer when I was drinking really hard and I’m around 206lbs now. I’m going to start running again. I’d like to see my body benefit from cutting out this vice. Right now the struggle is that I enjoyed drinking. It was part of my day. I don’t crave it, doesn’t bother me to not have it, my body isn’t fighting me for it, I just liked it. Felt great to unwind with it; until the next morning sometimes. But I kept doing it because I liked it.  I hope there’s noticeable benefit coming my way so deeper down I know there’s reason to keep not doing it. I am going to make it through January though. At least I hope so. It’s dealing with the time off, friends, etc that causes moment for pause. To me it feels like I know I can do it but would choose not to. Like going for a jog but after a mile telling yourself you’d rather walk when you’d originally left the door saying you were going to hit it hard.  Is there better things to come?

Every story you folks share in here helps me to feel encouraged or even reminded about what alcohol does to me. Members of this group have also been immensely supportive of me when I relapsed. 

AA has been a huge part of my sobriety (despite much apprehension on my part) also. Everything is better today than last year. I have lost 60 pounds, I am halfway through a masters in counseling, my relationships are all better, and I am present and available for whoever needs me.

1q6hx2y,Pink cloud round 2 or am I just content now?,"I stopped drinking 4 months ago after 16 years of heavy drinking. I was super positive and excited about it once I got through detoxing and then about 20 days in, I hit the low and lonely stage. I was isolating and overwhelmed with all the emotions. I stuck to a routine of just sitting at home alone and letting myself feel everything. It was very difficult and I wasn't sure I could keep going, but I did. Slowly that feeling of loneliness and missing my old life started to melt away.

I went to visit family for a week over the holidays and I had THE BEST time being present, not detoxing/being hungover like usual, or plotting my next drink the whole time. I also just celebrated my 35th birthday SOBER, surrounded by friends for a whole weekend and it was truly the best birthday I've had since I was a kid. On Monday, I was driving home from work and just in a really good mood... then I got scared. I am just not used to feeling this feeling of contentment, because I've been depressed and suppressing for SO LONG. Is it possible I'm in the pink cloud again or should I just realize that this is my life? I HAVE done the work and am continuing to (I have been going to a therapist that specializes in addiction for 6 months, got on anxiety and depression meds that are working for me, and lost 20 lbs by eating healthier/lightly working out, connecting with friends/family more regularly, paying down credit cards that I ran up buying alcohol, etc).

I guess I'm just wondering if this is normal? I have always been a bit of a pessimist/realist so accepting that I've done the work to get where I am and am deserving of good is hard. I was such a selfish shit head for so long while abusing alcohol, that I'm wondering how I got to the other side. I am just so scared of accepting that I might actually just be content with the calm of life, because I don't want to lose it.

How would you describe this part/moment of the vicious cycle of getting sober and drinking again?

Usually after hangover I have sworn to myself I will never touch alcohol again. Then depending on the life situation and other factors, I would feel fine, even euphoric for promosing myself I'm now free. There might be even time when I wouldnt miss alcohol.

But then I'd get all of a sudden (usually when i have difficulties in relationship or other emotional triggers) this all of a sudden urge that I just have to drink, no matter what. And i realize in those moments, no matter how genuinely I have made vows not to drink, I'd feel completely helpless. I just had that feeling yesterday. What makes it horrible is that, even if i resist it, then it makes me scared and worried that another time, I might just give in. It steals joy and self confidence.

1q6gurc,Combatting the pending relapse,"The last time I quit for more than 60 days, I chose my relapse point well in advance. It was a trip I was going to take and I had already decided before I left that I would drink. I am deciding NOT to do that.

Now that I am again over 60 days, I've found the ""one day at a time"" strategy is working better. But this time, I am using it to stop the thoughts of drinking in the future. Spring is coming and that is travel season for me. So rather than think about whether I am going to drink, I catch myself and say, 1) 'You are here, not there. Today you decided not to drink and you can do that for sure.' and 2) 'Do you feel good? Do you sleep well? Why would you throw that away? It's so easy and cheap just to keep functioning well. Challenge yourself some other way.' 

Relapses happen. Most of us will have many more relapses than we'll ever have successes - like relationships LOL. But, avoiding the relapse, for me at least, is now my biggest challenge. If I do relapse, it will be because I failed in the moment. And, as I write this, my 'alcohol brain' is scared. It is making me feel anxiety because I might just be on to something.

Apparently embarrassing myself in front of my wife and kids was some sort of control seeking measure for my brain to dictate the outcomes of something in my life that felt like it was spiraling. Since when did self destruction become an attractive hill to died on via poison. While I'm grateful that I was able to shake it off at home and nurse myself back to homeostasis I haven't been able to be kind enough to myself to forgive the treasonous actions I committed to myself. I made a pact and did better than I have in the past with my drinking last year. But the 2 week long binges in Q4 erase all the work with 2 terrible weeks of being useless to my family and self. 

I know once I hit a month and get back into my routine of eating right and working out this will all be an after thought but I had to dump my brain somewhere that I can get some decent feedback on my thoughts instead of a self prescribed echo chamber that will feel like a marker in life to refer back to past failures.

A year ago even a week felt daunting but with the knowledge and support given by this Sub the days turned into weeks, weeks into months, months into a year, and I'm determined for the year to turn into the rest of my life. 

My life isn't perfect, I still have issues I deal with, I still carry so much regret and embarasement, but I take comfort each day in knowing I'm not adding to them by drinking and grateful that I am a better, more present version of myself for my spouse, my children my friends and for myself.

Late 60's and drank heavily for decades.  Was planning to do Dry January last year for the 6th or 7th time .  January 1st was a Wednesday and I told myself ""Well, technically we're still in the holiday week, so my last drinking day will be Sunday the 5th"" (funny how we can negotiate with ourselves and rationalize anything).

And there I was, the evening of Monday January 6th, still drinking, standing at the liquor cabinet sneaking pulls out of a bottle of whyskey when my wife unexpectadly came around the corner into the kitchen. The look of hurt and disapointment in her eyes shot through me to my heart.  And in that moment I realized I could no longer lie and hide the extent of my drinking from her (though she was well aware I overdrank), and more importantly, I could no longer lie to myself.

Had lurked on this sub for a year or so but got serious on Tuesday the 7th.  I know AA has been such a blessing for so many people but never felt it was a fit for me.  Saw multiple references to Allen Carr's book, downloaded it, read it and it flipped a switch for me (others highly recommend Annie Grace).  As I read it I captured key quotes that spoke to me and to this day I re-read those every morning to remind myself.

I also visited this sub mutiple times a day to get help and inspiration and hopefully, in a small way, give back to help others going through the same process and struggles that we all share.  I still do today and believe I will for the rest of my life.

1q6fsq9,"Blew up my career sober, please remind me that I shouldn’t deal with the aftermath by drinking.","My relationship with alcohol is, like everyone else on this sub’s, both complicated and simple. Further complexity is added by the fact that I have for the last few years, made my livelihood in alcohol marketing, and knowing a lot about wine has made me very popular at parties.

However, after my ad agency’s end of year party in December 2024, I got incredibly blackout on tequila on an empty stomach with my colleagues and scared the shit out of my poor partner so badly that he was debating taking me to the hospital. I have no memory of getting home or what happened afterwards but I apparently said some horrific things, things I would have never have said in real life. 

Important context that one of my partner’s parents struggled with addiction and because of their actions he no longer has a relationship with them. He essentially said he couldn’t be with someone who reminded them of (that parent) and so I had to choose. 

I chose him and channeled the angry, stressed part of me that wanted to get very wine drunk at the end of every workday into obsessing over my career, and as a result got a huge opportunity and a big salary jump for a job that was, ironically working directly for a wine brand. While the career transition was stressful, I managed to deal with my cravings through positive outlets and stayed sober through 2025.

For reasons unrelated to my drinking I realised near the end of last year that I had to resign, even without something else lined up. I tried to hold on as long as I could because my partner also got retrenched during this period (marketing is a brutal industry!) But one day things came to a boiling point and I realised that staying would do long term damage to both my mental health and professional reputation.

Which brings me to today. Finding freelance work has been much harder than expected and my partner is still struck in recruiting hell (remember what I said about a brutal industry?) We were both relatively high earners but like many in our 20s living paycheck to paycheck and the anxiety is starting to roll back in in waves. All I want to do is go out and buy a really nice bottle of wine to make it go away, but the rational part of me knows not to let that particular genie out the bottle.

I just wanted to make this post to say for the first time since i was probably 18 (I am now 26) I am almost one week sober. I know its not a lot and now I'm typing it out, it actually looks silly saying it but its a big step for me.

I have drank pretty much every weekend, some weekdays for most of my adult life, it used to be a lot heavier drinking, but in the last year I started drinking less and less however the frequency didn't slow down, it may have even picked up a bit due to a shitty job and a few other factors.

I finally came to a realisation that I didn't like it, i watched a few videos on sobriety and the effects of alcohol and it was like a light switch moment, I knew I had to stop.

What also really helped, and I hope it can help others, is I heard someone (unfortunately I cannot remember who)say something along the lines of 'the feeling of being sober beats the feeling of being hungover.' This has really helped!

My recipe is basically, muddle a slice of jalapeno and lime wedge, add crushed ice, then pour over limeade made of 1/3 lime juice, 2/3 bubble water, maybe a tablespoon or so of sugar, if a smaller glass, pinch of salt-- not enough to truly taste, but enough to pop everything up a bit--

Last night, on a whim, I added a ""float"" Firestone Walker Zero Lager to the top-- SO good, and something about the two ""virgin"" drinks colliding confused my taste buds enough that I almost felt bad drinking the one I had made, and the one was plenty- It was very convincing and a nice, ""adult""/""cocktail snob"" flavor.

All the zero products have come a LONG way since 2014, when all that was available was still mostly Clausthauler, O'Doulls and the like. And, using them as mixer in mocktails to give that telltale ""beer"" and familiar ""adult"" flavor is great!

1q6favv,New year-new me routine with a twist,"So my last post here was about fiancee not talking to me since I got blasted enough on 24th December dinner at her fathers that I wasn't able to speak. I apologized, of course, and thank God everything went to normal. Which is a good thing. And may have been bad thing in disguise, depending on the one who reads this.

So, new year, new me routine? Or is it just a crap for modern day psychologists who want to get cheap money from their books.

For me I deffinitely made a choice - not to make choices. And especially not to make some absolutistic choice like ""not a sip of alcohol any time, ever"". That is because insofar I have dissapointed myself for doing exactly that and time and time again failed. When your brain registered failure, it gives you a failure aura. And I do not want to do that.

Now, this is not a post about me stopping not wanting to drink. I still want to stop it being something my days resolve around, but with rectain twist. Time will tell how good or bad it will go.

So here are some of my decisions/rules, which I will try to adhere as much as I can.

1. No drinking monday-thursday whatsoever. Working days and there is no room for alcohol. Fridays maaaaaaybe, saturdays maaaaaybe, sundays also off.

2. No alone drinking. No point in it whatsoever. I will try to bypass it with something sweet, rather than alcohol.

3. Telling my fiancee whenever I get urge to drink or when I will have a drink, if I do.

4. When friends ask me out for a beer, I will accept - but won't drink, or at least will do my best not to. They will understand.

5. Breaking the cycle - the main issue is when my brain decided I will drink, he kind of orders me to drink. So that is the trickiest part. Sometimes I can't post here because I am either driving my car/not near my cell/computer to ask you to push me out of alcohols way. So strategies will have to be found.

6. Working out more. Have done it, will continue to do it.

7. If I am ina situation where I can't avoid drinking 1 drink (and there will be plenty of those, either because of family or because of type of work I do), I will do my best to stay at that 1 drink (see also - 1).

So here is the provisional list of rules. Happy to say that after 1.1. the total score is 3:3 of not drinking days (not smashed, not drank alone, but still drank couple of beers). Hopefully by the end of January I would be proud to tell you I made it to 28:3 days, but the road to there is long one. And so it will take one day at the time.

Sorry for longer post, had to vent it out a bit.

DISCLAIMER: this list is for ME, and if there is anyone who is struggling, while still thinking ""Oh yeah, I can try to manage it with drinking"", please understand that every one of us is individual and therefore for many no drinking is the only answer (I think it is for me also, but the reasons for doing this are elaborated earlier on).

I had a drink on 4 separate occasions over the holidays, although not enormous amounts. I didn’t enjoy it as much as I thought I would but I didn’t suffer any particular negatives either. So, I am now back on my 4th day sober and don’t feel particularly inclined to drink again as it wasn’t that great and the whole reason for starting this process was to improve my health. However, based on my recent experience I know that I’m able to have a drink with little (immediate) consequence and this makes it easier to succumb again. Any advice?

1q6bxt2,I miss a person who didn’t exist and an unhealthy life. It’s been really hard.,"Approaching 100 days sober soon (at 96 currently) and man, at the beginning, everything felt great. I felt healthier, I wasn’t blowing all my money on partying, I was sleeping and eating again and I felt like I was getting back to me. But man, these past few weeks, it’s just been a landslide. I still get residual shakes, my body jerks, I have trouble sleeping, rampant anxiety that makes me feel like I’m about to have a seizure and croak even though I’ve never had one, nor am at risk for one, and I even ran off to the ER last night convinced I was dying and they told me I was basically a nutjob, slapped with me a dose of Ativan and sent me home. I’m on a lovely medication cocktail consisting of Straterra for my ADHD, Hydroxyzine, Clonidine and Buspirone for my anxiety and then Trazodone for my sleep, and yet I still don’t feel like me.

The days are bland, I don’t have a social life anymore aside from my roommates, I struggle to find joy in anything. All I feel is emptiness, mixed with regret and anger. While I know I had a problem and I did it to myself, oh man have I been missing the “old me” that even though he was numbed out of his mind by alcohol most of time, he didn’t care. He was engaging, he found joy in everything, he laughed, he loved, he played, he was present. He didn’t tremble and check himself into the hospital, he didn’t feel empty or tremble or struggle to sleep. He was functional. He had a job, he had great friends and a fruitful social life. While I know it was simply the dopamine that alcohol provides, I miss those expressive qualities. I miss joy, I miss going out and losing myself in the fun of the night. I know it was unhealthy and I am better off now, but gosh, it sucks mourning someone that you used to be, even if it was a temporary manufactured being. 

I am currently in therapy and still playing around with meds with my GP, but man, this has been rough. I don’t really know the point of this post, just needed to clear my head.

1q69lyh,Brain dump - guilt & panic,"I had a New Year’s Day yoga class + journaling workshop I booked a month or so in advance and looked forward to. You know where this story is going. It was also a preventative investment and commitment for me to not drink too much or stay up too late on NYE. I succeeded in doing this! I didn’t drink a ton or stay up past 10pm. 

Alas, I feel so disappointed because I did not make it to the class. 

The combination of very little food New Year’s Eve day plus drinking some alcohol throughout the day (including the secret half bottle of warm white wine hidden in my closet) before going out for more drinks didn’t bode well. I looked back at my consumption and felt like I had somehow been duped by my best friend, Alcohol, as I had been so faithful and drank an amount that should have been no problem to handle. In retrospect, neither the buzz or the numbness escape nor the social anxiety slayer effect were made available to me that night, and hadn’t been accessible to me in some time. I continued searching for it whenever possible all year long. 

On New Year’s Day morning, the greatest (re: worst) hits of the previous year played itself on a reel in my mind: work disappointments and stressors; ups and downs with my husband with some major disagreements due to stubbornness and lack of healthy communication; the light bulb moment where my sister and I came to finally recognize (in our 40’s) that we were raised by a narcissist mother, an enabling father, and a bunch of enmeshed, “flying monkey” relatives and the heartbreaking events that led us there; the self-preservation decision to go no contact with my family aside from my sister; major health issues that led to ER visits and major surgery with two leaves of absence from work. It was a lot to process and impossible to fully explain. 

More acutely, the new years evening not turning out as I had planned (shocking): a get together with friends that felt forced on account of the occasion, the omnipresent weighted blanket of vigilance and anxiety that represents my extremely difficult/energy vampire/impossible to please elderly, dementia setting-in mother in law being around for the past two weeks and needing constant supervision/fussing over and making sure she was okay and had everything she needed throughout the two weeks and at the friends get together and much anticipated fancy party in our neighborhood. Feeling the anger and resentment that I had unsurprisingly been denied the freedom to focus on my own pursuit of enjoyment/unwind/read/work on professional and personal development courses and goals in my two weeks of time off from work and the last night of the year. I felt silly and regretful about the amount of stock I put into what the evening could and should have been. I had a beautiful outfit and killer makeup that I carefully planned and executed that I didn’t get to feel good about myself in for too long, because mother in law looked miserable and clearly wanted to leave to go home and watch Times Square coverage and comment about how she didn’t know any of the musicians, etc. This all may sound self-absorbed but I had not put on a full face of makeup and sparkly clothes and accessories for a long time. The health issues including the major, un-glamorous surgery took up a large chunk of the year so I felt inspired to make a fuss. “When you look good, you feel good” was an aspiration. 

I woke up with the chills and sweats as well as a really unsteady stomach the next day. No matter what I did I could not shake it. Usually a cold morning walk with my dog would slap these feelings out of me but my dog didn’t want to walk far that morning and I could not will myself to walk on my own. I came back in and put my hood up, heating pad and electric blanket on, and attempted to bring my heart rate and anxiety level down with comfort and quiet. Tinnitus raged in my ears and the short arm’s reach of my white noise machine felt miles away. Ice cold water didn’t taste good and my favorite hot tea turned cold after I didn’t feel like dealing with it. I felt scared and ashamed. The yoga class + journaling workshop would been a great solution in theory, but the idea of surrounding myself with positive people who were not on the verge of a panic attack was more than I could face. I sent a last minute vague and mildly incoherent apology email to the yoga teacher and small studio owner despite having her phone number because I am a coward when it comes to facing the music with my drinking. 

When not having the obvious because of alcohol shits all day, I drifted off into unrestful sleep off and on throughout the day. I could not eat and I was dehydrated. The envisioned positive day with a fresh start after the worst year of my life was a disaster. I could not figure out why I was feeling this way and blamed everything but the alcohol for causing it. 

I did it again two days later with a post-holiday get together with drink pusher neighbors and then I did it again the next day when I was alone in my house.  My husband was away for a short period on an overnight trip and I was able to drink freely, which had slowly grown to become my favorite thing which was tied with my secret drinking during my work days in my home office. Prior to starting my drinking for the day, I got rid of all bottles that were safe to be seen and the secret ones I had been stashing. Side note: I had recently found empty bottles and forgotten empty beer cans hidden at the top of my closet in boots that I had no memory of putting there. That scared the shit of me, but not enough to not do it again. And again.  

I am autistic (Asperger’s) with ADHD, so the freedom of my quiet house has always allowed me access to letting my guard down completely/unmasking and not having to wear my “normal human suit.” Alcohol had always helped this part as well as supported the required socializing requirement of life. My overactive and hyper vigilant brain can take well-deserved and essential, restorative time off when it is quiet and I am alone. I am free to do my little tics and rituals and ADHD the fuck out without anyone noticing the way I breeze through my house with several works in process, allowing myself to enjoy the distraction of habits like leaving something in a certain place as a reminder to do that thing in that spot later when I pass by again, and no one moving it before I come back around which completely destroys the reminder I set up for myself and that thought is gone forever or I get snippy and defensive because of the intrusion. 

I started drinking early in the day, turned on good music, cleaned my house, more or less performed an exorcism in the guest room that my mother in law had been staying in, and settled into an evening on the couch after an accomplished day, still kind of drinking but not really wanting to but also not wanting to leave any empty drops. 

I had convinced myself that my body and mind’s reactions the past few days had been one-offs and I could handle alcohol still, even though I knew this was one of many lies and excuses I told myself. I had a similar reaction the next day and realized that this was my body and mind waving the white flag. I took my blood pressure and it was through the roof. The non-stop chatter in my head, the disgust and self-hatred, the existential crisis, and the guilt all ruled the day. 

It has only been a few days since my last drink but the relief, peace, quiet, and optimism I have remind me of how things can be and how they have been during every one of the many stints of sobriety I have enjoyed since kicking off the journey seeking abstinence in 2018. I so wish that would have been something that stuck but there have been lessons in every failure. It has been some time since I have felt simple joy and peace which I know is available to me in sobriety. The huge amount of time and mental space I carved out for the relentless worship of alcohol has left me with space to recognize a tingly spark of creativity and motivation. I remind myself I can still have my neurodivergent-palooza alone days at home to do my thing, but they are truly so much better without alcohol. 

I am removing the major bulldozer that has destroyed so many things in my life and kept me small and stuck. Sobriety, to me, feels like the unmistakable, comforting feeling of going to bed in and waking up in clean sheets each day.

First wine usually gives me a headache right off the bat, so easily I walk away from it and go home. Second beers and ciders, honestly I just wanna go to bed, it takes more time to drink, always makes me full and more times than not I never finish the first pint. If I finish and get a second maybe I have two sips and go home.

My issues since I was basically 14 was liquor, for me it triggers something else entirely. Long story short I had my first sip of liquor in a month tonight, had 3 liquor drinks with a cider, I have noticed after not drinking liquor the extreme difference but also I noticed my ability to not push it. Because I’ve been able to have a cider or glass of wine and just go home.

I honestly am not worried too much because while I got that little kick in, I still held to some of my rules on getting home for solid sleep, water and food.

I guess I’m just curious if any of you slowly worked your way into just not really care for drinking? After this past month I feel I am hitting that point. Like….the repercussions out weight wanting to drink….ive also been slowly getting better over the years, i used to not care but now am just like….i rather go to bed lol

1q69363,That one time people thought I was trying to kidnap a woman…,"So, funny—but also kind of sad—story. Way before alcohol became the supreme ruler of my life, there was a time I never drank. In fact, I did not have my first taste of it until college. Even then, I rarely drank because addiction runs so rampant in my family.

During the first winter break of my freshman year, I went to visit my mother six hours away from campus. My mother had an on-again, off-again relationship with alcoholism, and during that time, she had been a sober-ish, very moderate drinker.

She invited me to go with her and her coworker to one of those riverboat, late-night, over-30s party cruises. I was definitely the youngest person there. I enjoyed seeing my mother enjoy herself, as she tends to be a stressful person. Music was playing the old-school jams, and we were having a good time at first.

But as the boat was returning to the dock, I did not realize my mother’s trips to the bathroom were her excuses to drink more alcohol without me knowing, as she knew I would have stopped her. By the time we were leaving the boat, my mother could barely walk straight.

Her coworker expressed her concerns, but I assured her I would get my mother home safe as she ordered a ride home.

We get to the parking area and my mother completely refused to move. She just sat down on the ground in a drunken stupor. No matter how hard I tried, she would not move on her own accord. So, I had to literally drag her the twenty feet to the car.

Literally six or seven times I had to tell people passing by, ""Okay, I know what this looks like, but I promise you this is my mom."" It was so horrible.

I told myself I would never get that bad with alcohol. But oh no, the apple fell directly to the ground from that tree. I am glad to say I am a year and some change sober.

1q68s68,Dry January tips,"Well done all dry January folk! I’m just thinking the first weekend is coming up! For me the first two weekends were crucial for me to break my weekend ‘I deserve to go to the pub’ feeling. I used to go on a Thursday night and not a Friday ( because I had a morning fitness class on Saturday) but from about 3pm Saturday I could be found having beers and it wasn’t unusual to be until 2am, then hungover Sunday and takeaway. 

So I had to nail the weekends - here are my tips for some weekend stuff to keep you on the straight and narrow and I hope others can add- 

1. Booked a cinema ticket for 10:30 am viewing - got to cinema for 10 am, got a fancy coffee and enjoyed a quiet cinema - practically a private viewing ! 

2. Used my saved £££ from not drinking to go to my fave restaurant for lunch. Normally it would be evening with wine and cocktails instead of dessert. That lunch I had 3 courses and a coffee and had to trundle home for a nap!

3.Pick out an old classic movie or two and have a movie night 

4 . Find a morning fitness class. Mine is out door and it’s Saturday morning, it actually stopped my Friday drinking habit long before I stopped the rest of the drinking. You get to feel extra smug heading home at 9:30 am for coffee, knowing a lot of world is asleep and you have hit your exercise target. 

5. Boring sounding but you have saved time by not being hungover - pick a drawer that has been annoying you and sort it. Give yourself 20 mins. Boom! Done! Increased smugness ! 

6. Another old hobbies? Unplayed musical instruments? This is time to reconnect. I’ve knitted 4 gorgeous sweaters after decades of absence. 

7. If you are going to the pub, it’s allowed! Plan ahead what you will drink, I like a soda and blackcurrant, I’m also now partial to a Fanta. I’ve encountered a few mango shakes and iced drinks . If it’s an NA beer I love a Guinness zero, I love an erdinger wheat beer, the key is to remember you won’t drink like you used to, ie 6 in a row, pace yourself, I’ll have 2 erdinger then I do always leave earlier now than I used to, the great news is I’m still sober and so I can do anything from the list above when I get home!

1q66ym6,"9 months sober in prison, 13 days out so far","Well, I found the secret to finally cutting out booze. Prison!

Not ideal, but i was sentenced back in March to prison (completely unrelated to my drinking, remarkably) and went from drinking an average of nearly 9 standard drinks a day (I know because i was tracking it in an effort to cut down) to being stone cold sober. 

  
My life, prior to incarceration, was a chaotic whirl of felonies for profit, 3 young children, a crumbling marriage, and a steady drum beat of alcohol to distract me from the hurricane I was summoning around me. In the months leading up to my sentencing I was basically drunk or hungover permanently, prior to that I was regularly binge drinking and then taking a few days off. I drove drunk and actively drank while driving routinely, I drank at work, I drank in the morning, I drank at any and every event.

  
Prison offered me a gift I had always withheld from myself, space. Suddenly I couldn't access booze (easily, it's there for sure) and I also couldn't rush into other distractions to hide from my experience. I had time to think. The last few months I was locked up I was in a work release program where I was out among the general population 5 days a week for work. Drinking was suddenly possible again, but I found that I had a grasp on my goals and priorities that I hadn't had since my early 20s (when they included drinking prominently) and I had zero problem sticking to sobriety. 

  
On Christmas day I a released and flew immediately to visit family, where drinking prodigiously is a cherished tradition, and spent what was a scary but ultimately awesome weekend reconnecting with family members that I hadn't spent sober time with since childhood and helping my aging aunt get some physical chores done along her house. 

  
Now, I'm home again. My ex has served me with papers requesting full custody of my 3 children and accusing me (falsely) of domestic abuse and (accurately) of being an alcoholic. The world is full of triggers and memories and reflexes. I found myself grabbing some lunch from a deli i used to regularly start my drinking day at and I just automatically walked to the beer singles cooler and stood there for like 30 seconds before I walked away. My life is in shambles and I'm facing a terrible legal loss of my children without any legal council. But still the urge is gone. 

  
I spent 20 years needing no excuse to drink my feelings away. And now, suddenly, I find myself able to face this shit storm with some degree of equanimity and acceptance of my feelings and their validity. 

  
So, while I won't go so far as to recommend prison as a tool of sobriety, I will encourage everyone to take hold of the gifts I found there and which are lying at all of our feet. Give yourself space to react and feel and emote to your world without feeling like you have to respond. Take some time to yourself each day to just be with your experiences and the feelings they inspire. Find a way to realize how much worse things can get and to identify the blessings that you do have in your life.

1q663cm,I realized that 95% of the drinking I’ve done in my life has been alone,"for background, I’m 29 years old, female, married. as the title says, I’ve come to the realization that probably 95% of the drinks I’ve ever had have been alone in my apartment. sounds depressing, right? 

  
for more context, my wonderful husband is 10 years sober, and was sober when we met- so he’s never been a drinking buddy for me. I do have good girlfriends, but none of them are heavy drinkers, so we maybe only drink together 2x monthly. but man, I have ALWAYS loved drinking alone and it’s been toxic for at least the past 7 years. whenever im left to my own devices, I become the most toxic version of myself and way overindulge in wine. no one else suspects a problem tho cause on the surface I have it all together. 

but today is 3 days AF for me. these past 10 days, I’ve been home alone as my husband is visiting his mom out of state. for those first 7 days alone, it was a solo wine night every night- culminating in me visiting multiple grocery stores to buy multiple bottles so the cashier doesn’t look at me funny, and getting way too drunk to the point of hating the taste of wine, unable to stop. 

I know this has to end, and just wanted to share for whoever relates. I turn 30 years old this June, and want to truly feel like the best (and sober) version of myself by that new decade of life. thanks in advance for the support ♥️♥️",1767761197.0,110,26,stopdrinking,substance
1q65kq0,I said no to a trip to France to protect my sobriety,"My family members are going to France this year for a trip and for a lot of it they’ll be going to wineries and I know they’ll be drinking wine daily on the trip.

If I went it would be just me sober, with my mom & stepdad, sister & brother-in-law all consuming alcohol the whole time.

I’ve been wanting to go on some sort of fun trip for a bit (haven’t traveled much as I’ve been saving money for a while) but I realized this trip would really be a struggle for me where I’m still pretty new to sobriety and last year relapsed quite a few times during my sober attempts.

When I started 2026 I told myself the biggest non-negotiable for me this new year is to truly not drink and put sobriety first. I originally wanted to do that in 2025 but had quickly caved last year.

I hope to feel strong enough in my sobriety eventually where I’d feel fine to participate in a trip like that, but right now I don’t feel like it’s a smart idea.

Hurt by my actions I’ve committed when I wasn’t sober. Hurt by the disappointment and bridges I’ve burned. I know that this a part of the process. The grief is accompanied by temptation. This is usually the part of the cycle where I cave. Start wandering downtown telling myself “it’s just one…it’ll take the edge off…It’s been a long day, you could use an ice cold beer, and warm shot of whiskey”. But it’s never just one, one turns into two or three, one night turns into four, so on and so forth.

Being drunk and on blow felt like home however it was much like an affair, full of highs and lows. Something I kept behind closed doors until I unraveled. There’s a lot of realities I’m facing. As much as I loved someone, it hurts to know I loved drugs and alcohol more. As much as I don’t want to believe that’s true, it is cause I made that choice to drink that love away. The harsh consequences are moments lost that I’ll never get back. I guess it’s for the best, I need to learn how to love myself, sit with who I truly am, figure out what my values are before extending love to others. I can’t find those things in a bottle.

1q64vol,Passed 3 years sober - What actually changed,"
I passed 3 years sober on Boxing Day.

I don’t post much, but I remember reading posts like this early on and thinking, “Must be nice, I don’t see how I’ll ever make it there” 
So this is for the guys/gals still counting hours, or white-knuckling Friday evenings.

Here’s the honest version, not the Instagram one. Quitting alcohol didn’t magically fix my life.
I didn’t wake up happy. I didn’t magically love myself. But I did stop running from myself. 

The first 6-8 months was uncomfortable as hell. A lot of restlessness. A lot of boredom. A lot of realizing alcohol had been doing way more emotional work than I wanted to admit. Somewhere along the way I learned that sobriety wasn’t about removing alcohol, for me, it was about rebuilding structure in my new life. Alcohol had been my off switch, my reward system, my stress relief, my excuse. When it was gone, I had to replace it with something real.

For me that looked like:
	
Simple routines like forcing discomfort in some form or another. Fewer promises, but actually keeping them. Letting go of the idea that I needed to feel motivated first, and reading, (“A Changed Mind” has been my favorite book).

Life is still hard. I still get tired, frustrated, and doubtful. But now I trust myself to handle it, and that’s everything.

If you’re early on and struggling: nothing is “wrong” with you. You’re just learning how to live without numbing out, and that takes time.

So keep going. Quiet consistency adds up faster than you think.

Smoking and drinking are the worst theifs of life force energy. you look like a fool when you consume them. Plus it doesn't solve anything. I have smoked countless cigs and yet non of them solved anything. 

Same is with drinking. Drinks have never solved any of my problems. It has just numbed me and made me feel like shit. The feeling of being loved by a girl, the high we get after workout, completion of a day long work, helping out family and friends, etc These things give me more happiness then any of the smoke and drink in the world.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink.* It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**  A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:**  A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It’s Wins Wednesday!

The win I’d like to share is that this past year I’ve been at a new job that has been really challenging, but I’ve been able to meet that challenge without any issues because I’m always at 100%.  

My most recent win is that I’ve reconnected with someone who I was very interested in last year, but committed to remaining single until I was ready to get back out there.  It was totally worth the wait. :)

I've heard ""just wait a bit longer; every day gets better"", etc., etc. It's been 4 months, and I feel worse than when I was drinking.

My depression is actually worse now, from not sleeping,  and never getting a ""break"" from the symptoms by drinking. Same with GABA insufficiency, dopamine signaling issues, and temporal lobe epileptic seizures. The psych meds they've tried me on have either not worked or made things worse.

1q61v99,"""Hanxiety""","Long time listener first time caller:

""Hanxiety"" is a word that has come into the lexicon within the past few years and I often hear people attributing it to regret or worry about blackouts, drunk texts, arguments, or other actions undertaken whilst inebriated.

This feeling was one of the main driving forces in my decision to stop, but it's always been categorically different for me than how people often describe it.

I've surely woken up with immense regret after a drunken argument, injury, destroyed relationship, car accident, or other drunken idiocy, but what I noticed was this:

The Hanxiety had gotten progressively worse even if nothing bad happened. I could've had a great night, met great people, enjoyed myself, even done a good deed.

If I drank, I would still be consumed by a feeling of existential dread, fear, and awareness of my own mortality and fragility. This was far beyond what I would describe as ""regret"", and would manifest through drinking alone. 

This has brought me to the realisation that alcohol is going to make me feel like shit even if I don't act like shit. 

It creates a powerful chemical imbalance in my brain and leaves me devoid of the compounds required to feel good. It is literally rewiring me to feel like shit about myself, and think that I'm going to die right now.

This realisation has been immensely helpful in overcoming guilt and shame, and putting the onus on the drink (and not the drinker). 

Understanding this has made me at least somewhat more aware that these cravings are my reptilian mind attempting to feel better by dulling the fear that alcohol gave me in the first place. 

Even if I can make it to work, even if I'm kind to my friends and family, even if the night is calm and uneventful, even if I moderate (lol), I'm going to wind up laying in bed in a personal hell of alcohols creation.

I've been here many, many times but something about this time feels a little different. I've said this before, but this time feels DIFFERENT different. It feels time to give sobriety a real shot, rather than just a couple of months.

7 days alcohol free here! So proud, so happy - day 3&4 … and a bit of today was challenging 

I’m in a new city & boy is it hard! 

But I thought to myself ‘Why do I feel like I need to drink?’ Apart from that deep feeling of numbness that feels heavy in your chest & causes the occasional pang… loneliness. 

So I signed up to a salsa club that runs 3 days a week… I will do anything not to drink & make up for the nights I sat sad in my room crying to Lana Del Rey lol. 

I’m so proud of how seriously I’m taking this, I’m not even allowing myself a glass of wine on the worst days… because it’s NEVER a glass (more like 2-3 bottles!) & I hate it, but I’m allowing myself to feel those vile things called emotions & make some changes.

1q5zspg,Dry Januaryists - Day 6 - AF Drinks,"Feeling a bit down today, so I’m keeping this one short and sweet. I'm hoping to be back tomorrow with something a bit deeper, but for now, I just wanted to share what has worked for me regarding Alcohol-Free (AF) drinks.

I know for some, 0% drinks are ""non-alcoholic beer for non-alcoholics""—meaning they can be a trigger or a gateway back to the real thing. If that’s you, I totally respect that and this post might not be your cup of tea (literally).

For me, these haven't been about replacing ""big sessions,"" but rather having something to sip while cooking or after dinner. Most of the time I stick to sparkling water, but here is what I’ve found in my journey:

**Beers:**

* **Guinness 0:** By far my favourite. I don't keep it at home because of the calories, but it’s my go-to if I’m at the pub.
* **Peroni 0 / Lucky Saint:** Both are great, refreshing options—I've found they really need to be ice-cold.
* **BrewDog Punk AF:** A decent shout, though a bit heavy for my personal taste.

**Wine:**

* To be honest, I've found most of it pretty gross. The one exception for me has been **Wednesday Domaine's Eclat**. I’ve actually used this for events I’ve organised as an AF option for champagne receptions.

**Spirits:**

* I've found many AF gins are decent, but I've realised a straight-up tonic with lime often does the job just as well.
* **Pentire:** I’ve experimented with their flavours ors and they are okay for a bit of variety.

Again, this is just what has worked for my palate. I’d love to hear what others have found helpful (or what they avoid!).

I’m struggling a bit today, but I’m sticking to the plan.

My husband left for a business trip this afternoon and that is usually my opportunity to drink a ton of wine and eat like shit. When he first left, my first thought was, okay time to break out the wine! But I stopped myself and sat in my craving, tried to distract myself, and finally got through it. I instead ordered a bunch of Thai food and made myself a soda water with a little cranberry juice and basil (which I highly recommend, so good). Im so proud because I’ve tried and failed to get to a week so many times and I finally said no to my craving and now I’m hours away from that week goal.

1q5z4dg,100 Days! What I’ve Noticed,"Today I am 100 days sober and it truly feels surreal. Things I’ve noticed:

•	⁠My cat cuddles me every night again. She used to always and in the past 6 months or so had started sleeping under the bed. When I got sober, she started sleeping with me which brought me to tears. 

•	⁠I am so much more open and have become a bit of an over sharer. I was living with so much shame when I was in active addiction, which made me closed off from the world. Now I feel like I have nothing to hide. 

•	⁠I am immensely grateful for things in my life that I previously took for granted. 

•	⁠I am feeling SO much. Sometimes I cry for seemingly no reason at all. 

•	⁠Rejection in all forms can be tough to manage sober but getting through tough times without a drink makes me feel stronger. 

•	⁠My hair is growing so fast now. My skin looks so much better. People are telling me that I’m glowing. 

•	⁠I have not lost any weight (lol). Probably due to my sugar cravings. 

•	⁠I still like going to parties (I just leave earlier) and I make more meaningful connections and a much better impression. I still say stupid things sometimes but at least I’m clear-headed. 

•	⁠My goals feel so much clearer. I still struggle and grieve the time that I lost when I was drinking, and now have energy to try and make up for lost time. 

•	⁠I am incredibly lucky to be surrounded by so many supportive people who make an effort to include and be cautious of me. 

•	⁠I can still go on dates and make out with people. It’s still fun. Though I am much more picky now because I don’t have drinks to create false chemistry with people. People are kind of funny about me not drinking but generally pretty cool about it. 

•	⁠My energy levels are still fluctuating often. I go from blissed out and hyper to needing tons of rest. I am learning to listen to my body. 

•	⁠Caffeine affects me way more than it did before. 

•	⁠It is going to take me a while to fully recover from decisions I made while drinking, especially when it comes to my finances, but I feel better able to tackle those things now and make commitments to myself. 

•	⁠I wake up thankful to be alive everyday. 

•	⁠AA is not for everyone, but it is the place for me. Often the days that I don’t feel like going to a meeting are the days I have the most profound experience. 

•	⁠Nature and natural beauty impacts me so much more now. Sometimes the world looks so wonderful and it can be overwhelming. 

•	⁠I am still learning how to appreciate quiet and stillness. 

•	⁠Not drinking just feels normal to me now. I enjoy a sparkling water or NA beer at the end of the day as a “treat” but I don’t have to avoid the alcohol aisles of the supermarket. I rarely have cravings and when I do - it’s more like I am craving chaos than it is alcohol. Learning how to adjust to a softer life.

I fell off with evening binge drinking due to stress and then it morphed into a sleep aid.  If I told you half of what I have a night you would be shocked.  

I have symptoms of a couple of the well known brain issues with alcohol abuse. My body is...tired...I've depleted my reserves.  With my current work schedule I don't work every day and frequently end up not getting up until the afternoon because of prior drinking, wasting basically entire days.  Recently I was blackout and woke up to find I had fallen into a dresser and gashed the area along the eyebrow just above my nose...that could have been me breaking my nose or worse maybe my eyeball.  I've spent so many thousands of dollars on alcohol...and it's always been the cheap stuff of course. I'm prob 35 lbs overweight as well, because I have the days where I do less because of alcohol and it's been tacked on. I've also found myself making stupid decisions on social media because of it. 

I want to keep this off my insurance record, so I'll have to use one of the self-pay online options...but I'm going to get this started asap.  I'll have to do something for help with sleep too.

1q5xazi,Should I reset my 140-day sobriety counter after one unplanned shot?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been sober for 140 days, and I’ve been really proud of it. Over the holidays, something unexpected happened: I ran into someone who’s been my idol for years – someone I never thought I’d meet. In the moment, they offered me a shot, and it felt like a total ""force majeure"" situation – huge social pressure, completely out of the blue. I took it, but immediately regretted it. I didn’t have another drop after that, and I haven’t drank anything since.

It wasn’t a conscious choice to drink – more like an automatic reaction in a surreal moment – and there was no binge or loss of control afterward.

Now I’m wondering: do I reset my counter to day 1, or can I keep counting from 140+?

I know some people are strict about “one drink = reset,” but others say it only counts as a relapse if it was intentional or led to more drinking.

What do you think? Would you reset in this situation, or keep the streak going (maybe with a little asterisk)?

Thanks for any thoughts – this community has been a huge help.

​I needed a lot of space for myself lately. Time to heal, but also time to fight the wars on the outside. It is still hard for me to open up, but this has to get out.

​Behind me lie four years in a toxic relationship that almost tore me apart. A dynamic shaped by Borderline Personality Disorder, depression, and substance abuse. I lost 18 kilos (approx. 40 lbs) in the last few weeks just from the stress.

The hardest loss was my dog. My best friend. One snap of a finger and he stood by my side without a leash. Having to leave him behind hurts every single day.

​But today, on Day 212, things are different.
I am no longer reacting, I am acting.

​I am finally drawing boundaries on all fronts:
​My son now lives exclusively with me.
​I am in court with my ex-wife fighting for sole custody.
​I am taking legal action against my ex-girlfriend to finally have peace.

​I won the legal case against my employer.

​At the same time, I am clearing up the insurance chaos for my son (who is diabetic) and catching up on two years of tax returns that were left behind.

​I work on myself every damn day, I’m working out again. And I met someone where the foundation is right. For the first time. Open words, honest communication. Exactly how it should be.

I completely cracked at new year though. Pretty upset with myself tbh. Not gonna lie. Just so p*ssed off with letting myself break. I lost my brother 5 months ago and it's been tough. He was only 40 years old. I really started to care of myself more to respect him. He was an addict and I didn't want to tarnish my amazing memories with him.

I'm now about 5-6 days of zero alcohol. In this period I've had the worst anxiety and depression. I can just about manage with these but the insomnia is going to end me. Since the new year I've had 10 hours of sleep. 10 broken hours and zero deep sleep. I'm past the completely exhausted stage. I feel so miserable.

I can not get any sleep at all. 

When I lay in bed I feel very tired but then my body gets flooded with adrenaline. It then makes my mind race and it won't switch off. 

Did I do some damage from that alcohol abuse? I'm a little older now and my body just can't process alcohol anymore. When I was younger I could bounce back in a day or 2. 

I'm being snappy with people. I just want to hide away and let my body heal. I've been eating healthy all week to help repair any damage. I've even been doing some light workouts to try and make my body release some endorphins and it usually makes sleep at night much better.

Do I just need to ride it out? Will it take much longer to fully heal? I feel completely lost. I've had bad spells before but this time feels like something has been seriously damaged.

My dumb brain keeps saying. Drink a couple vodkas and it will knock you out. I'm definitely not gonna touch alcohol. I'm definitely gonna try and never touch it again. This just isn't worth it.

After my second Afib episode in early November and having to spend two days in ICU in the most horrible hospital in Egypt while on holiday, I figured I had had enough.

I work in an industry (travel) where most of the business and networking is done late at night over too many drinks. Long story short, too many long haul flights, too many late nights, way too many drinks, too many 14+ hours work days, too much junk food, too much coffee to compensate, too much overweight.

A few days ago I went to my local taproom, where I was their celebrated number 1 client based on Untappd.

1qamx8o,The wrong friendships affect us more than we think.,"Good evening everyone. I hope you’re all doing well and managing your situations as best as possible. I want you to know that you’re not alone.

This Sunday was a difficult day for me, and I spent a lot of time reflecting. Yesterday, Saturday, I relapsed for the second time since December 19th, which was the day I quit. I didn’t smoke much. Fortunately, it was just one bowl, about three or four hits, and then I threw it away because I became aware of the mistake I was making.

Since then, I’ve been thinking deeply, and there’s something important I want to share with you, which is the topic of friendships.

I have friends who completely normalized marijuana for me. When I was younger, I wasn’t a smoker and never planned to be. I’m not saying my friends were wrong for introducing me to it, that was simply the circumstance. We smoked together, we laughed, and we had great moments. I won’t deny that.

But as time passed and the years went by, I developed an addiction. Some of my friends did too, but most of them never saw it as a problem. They smoke and don’t consider it a big deal or anything serious.

When I started opening up to them about my addiction and how it was affecting me, they constantly minimized the situation. They would say things like that weed isn’t bad, that if you want to smoke you should smoke and if you don’t then don’t, that it’s not that deep, and that nothing is going to happen to you. They completely refused to acknowledge that marijuana can be harmful, that it can affect you, and that it’s not some magical substance.

They live under this delusion that weed isn’t harmful, that it isn’t addictive, and that it doesn’t cause physical or mental problems. I debated this with them many times, trying to explain why it can be harmful and how it affected me, but they always argued the opposite.

The reality is that they didn’t believe in my problem and they minimized it. They weren’t being good friends. They didn’t give me the basic support or empathy that anyone deserves. I wasn’t asking them to revolve their lives around me or to tell me what I wanted to hear. I just wanted to hear something like that they understood I was struggling and that quitting was probably the best thing for me.

Instead, they rejected the idea that there was even a problem. They kept repeating that I was exaggerating and that it wasn’t that deep. To them, it was almost a joke, and that really hurt.

That’s why I want to share this advice with you. If your friends are like that, either cut them off or clearly tell them how you truly feel. If you have friends who try to put that toxic idea in your head, that weed isn’t bad or that it isn’t affecting you, it’s better to distance yourself. Over time, you start believing that misinformation, and it keeps you from reaching your goal, which is quitting.

Having the right friendships is extremely important. If your friends don’t understand your struggle or the challenge you’re going through, it can be painful, and sometimes the best option is to step away, at least for a while. Being around friends who are smoking makes quitting much harder. If you keep surrounding yourself with that environment, stopping becomes even more difficult.

So my advice is this. If your friends don’t align with your goals and your purpose, it’s okay to take a step back. It might sound harsh, but I truly believe it’s the healthiest choice.

My friends introduced me to the substance, and looking back, I would have preferred never trying it because of the problems it brought into my life. That part isn’t their fault. What is our responsibility is choosing the people we surround ourselves with.

There’s nothing wrong with trying it, and there’s nothing wrong with occasional use. But once you have a problem and the people around you mock it or minimize it, that’s when it’s time to step back.

That group of friends, now ex-friends, were sedentary, unambitious, and not very successful. I’m not saying the stereotype is true, because it isn’t. You can smoke and still achieve things. But their mindset led nowhere, and I don’t want that for my life. I also don’t want to be someone with so little empathy.

Who you surround yourself with truly matters.

1qamm9p,Day One,"Please bear with me, it's been a rough few months.

25F, Rural Australia. Married. Smoked every afternoon since August 2024. Left job that involved driving as didn't want to risk my licence. Got smaller, less intense job, worse pay, less hours, better coworkers. No growth.

29/11/25 - Finally diagnosed with ADHD, medicated. Plan had always been to quit once medicated. I had quit for two weeks at that point to pass urine test, ended up not even being asked to do one, went ""fuck it"" and started up daily use again.

4/12/25, experienced extremely traumatic event involving suicide, discovery of remains, my home, my close family member. 

From that day until today, I have been smoking ~6? bowls every evening, and started smoking cigarettes too.

Every time I am high, I wish I hadn't smoked. I wish I had just stayed present with my body. I wish I hadn't given in, I wish I could go back the five minutes before. I wish that the ADHD meds felt like they were enough. I feel like I am deceiving my psych by using while taking prescribed meds that interact.

It's now 4:30pm. This is the time I usually start packing. Today is day one. I can't keep lying to myself and those around me. Anyone out there with any words for a sluggish, tired, ashamed, and guilty soul, any comment would be so valued. Thank you. ",1768196076.0,1,1,leaves,substance

1qaletr,It'll be all or nothing tomorrow.,"Six months I was totally dependant on the drug, and stopped using at home. When I'd travel for work, though, my boss would always offer some, and bust my balls a little if I said I was taking a break, so I'd usually go ahead. That would always lead to a horrendous cycle where I'd suck down two or three joints, huff a pen until an hour before bed, and sometimes we'd get high again before the next work day, which would obviously make me feel paranoid and more unprofessional than even I'm comfortable with. In the last couple months this broke me down so much I even brought home a pen I'd hit (a little? a lot?) on a midnight jog. My girlfriend didn't say anything, but I could read her disappointment when she could tell I was jonesing for it.

  


Then in December I didn't have a bit of travel work, and then my brothers came back in state. All of us hanging out all day at my parent's house, I had no desire to go home and be drugged out. Between a sketchy commitment in June, a coincidental lack of work, and the holidays, I had my longest dry spell for a long while.

The first 5 days were honestly hell, constant headaches, bad mood, increased anxiety, and so much more it would take forever to list. But now that I’m here, and have made it to day 9, I’m already feeling a new sense of optimism and clarity that disappeared about 1.5 years ago when weed became a part of my daily routine.

The realization happened last night, I went to the movies (one of my favorite activities) and even though the movie was mid, I enjoyed it in a way I haven’t been able to in so long. I was completely engrossed in the film, fully absorbing and processing the content I was watching. My brain was completely shut off and I was just in the moment, no eagerness about going home and hitting the pen or spacing out because I was clouded with brain fog.

Tonight I also took a shower and felt so present. Before when I was constantly high or coming off of the pen, it felt like I was just moving through the motions of my life. I didn’t realize how much joy I could feel from simple daily tasks like showering but it’s amazing. I was just washing my hair and jamming out to What It Sounds Like by Huntrix. It’s honestly the most pure joy that I have felt in a long time. 

All of this to say, if you are struggling or wondering if it’s even worth it to quit it is. I used to think I didn’t have a problem or that weed wasn’t what was making me feel overly anxious or depressed but over the past few days I’ve been sober I know that weed was a huge contributor.

1qah4pp,I lost my cart yesterday and I’m taking it as a sign,"I don’t think I’ve fully spent a month sober since I graduated high school in 2023. Obviously it took a lot of partying with friends and experimenting by myself to get to the point where I am. Nothing about weed really excites me anymore. Unless it’s social, but even then I feel like I have more fun getting fucked up by drinking (which is something I don’t do alone). Like almost everyone, it was just with friends here and there, to getting my own disposable cart living at my parents house, and then going off the deep end once I was able to access being high whenever I wanted to. Unless I had some obligation where I had to be sober, it would be rare for me to not get high before 10am. I could rationalize before hand with excuses such as “well I’m just gonna have a bowl or two and then I’ll do the dishes or laundry or some odd chore that would take me less than twenty minutes”, and then end up scrolling on my ipad until I felt the need to go out and smoke again. I feel like I’ve wasted my formative years sitting on my ass, binge eating and feeling sorry for myself when the obvious culprit is my addiction. I have never felt so depressed in my life. If I’m not high I’ll start anxious sweating for no reason when I’m getting ready to leave the house. It’s so fucking miserable and I have nobody to blame but my bad impulse control.

About a year ago I decided I wanted to take a break from smoking, and was clean for about three weeks. When I realized how much happier I was and how I wasn’t as anxious all of the time, my “rational thought” was if I was capable of low-key quitting I could get more weed and only have it occasionally. After a couple days I was back on my regular schedule of smoking every single day without a thought. I’d be sober at work and that’d pretty much be it. I haven’t really been able to admit that to anybody except for my friends who also smoke just as much as I do. It’s so fucking embarrassing telling people that I failed college classes because I’d rather get high and watch youtube. I’m currently not in classes this term for that reason. I can’t have another repeat of last year for that reason.

I recently had to move back in with my Grandma because my roommate situation fell through, and I am unable to afford to live by myself. It is a staunchly anti-marijuana household, but that did not stop me from switching from flower to carts, as I just was not ready to give up smoking even though I had to be sneaky about it. My cart just magically disappeared from my room yesterday when I was watching a movie. I put it in the usual hiding spot, in between the cushions of a chair, and settled on my bed after getting fucked up. Once I was “sober” enough to reup my high, I went to check the chair and it was just gone. I flipped my room completely upside down, considered removing the upholstery from the hiding spot chair, and eventually gave up looking because my search was fruitless….at that point I took a step back and considered how embarrassing it was how worked up I was feeling about losing my cart. What really sucks is the fact it was essentially brand new, and I hate the fact I essentially just put $40 down the drain, but I am taking it as a sign that I need to take a break. Maybe it was something divine telling me to start the new year right, I’m not sure.

I’m certain that I am not going to ask my sister to buy more shit for me indefinitely. I am not 21 until May, so that at least keeps me from the dispensary for a couple months. As of today, I am done getting high by myself. I can’t torture myself anymore. I’m hoping that documenting this now will be motivation to get my life back on track. I want to have motivation more than getting high to get out of bed in the morning. I want to start exercising and pick up more hobbies that don’t include being glued to a screen. Though I know my life isn’t magically going to stop being mediocre, I want to minimize what’s making me depressed as much as possible.

1qagi8u,2025 in a nutshell (mental prison),"I lost my job due to some visa issues(again) in November 2025. I haven't stopped smoking since, everyday I would wake up hating myself for the position I'm in, and I tell myself I will stop tomorrow. I lost a whole year and lived off my parents this whole time. 


I was in school to become a children's music teacher 

I smoked way too much everyday!  Hating myself for every joint, and yet I kept sparking the next. 

I went to the gym a total of 58 days in 2025, I had a few good streaks, but not with the frequency I wanted, I even my work outs were half assed. 


I had this daily loop of thoughts "" I will stop smoking weed > but cold turkey is too much so I will slowly cut back > this needs discipline > I will make a plan to quit > I need to make money > I need a job > I need to fix my visa for a better job > I need to get some type of degree > god I fucked up so bad > if I stop smoking things will get better > I should still count my blessings > I should get out of the house > I'm gonna go for a walk"" 

It took me 30 minutes to leave my apartment for any errand. And when I'm outside, I have the same thoughts, I only to tell myself I'm going prepare everything as soon as I get home! I will make a plan, and sit down and it's going to be awesome!  Then I get home and all that motivation melts away within 20 seconds. 

I applied for A few jobs and tried going back to school, but but my heart wasn't in it, I only got rejections. Having the financial and moral support from my family is truly a blessing, and a luxury that I should not take for granted anymore, by trying to get away from it. 

I dated a girl from mid December until April, she ended things because of my yelling. I'm usually a very calm guy, but I was so tense at the time that many little things got me so worked up. I had to do some deep self reflecting at the time about my controller issues, my anger, it's source. My emotional intelligence and maturity definitely needed polishing. 
I went in a few dates through the year, but I was telling myself ""I need to stay in the game"" so I was high during the dates, Nd couldn't really be in the moment. Though, I went out with a girl in November and something could have developed, we didn't match. I also saw that as far as dating goes, the withdrawals from weed are not a good relationship starter. No one should have to deal with that burden from the beginning. 


My younger cousin lives in the same city as me, he looks up to me in a way, I and I always felt like I need to be at my best when he's around, and he was around a lot of the times, but I he wasn't feeling well either and I know it's because he smokes too much too, he feels like he has no purpose in life, and I can't be the one to help him find it now, I felt a lot of pressure any time he was around. But at the same time he is the closest person to me here, he and he is truly genuine and understanding. 

Also, there was this dude I made music with who drained all my energy, I should have set my boundaries, but he would constantly and deliberately overstep them to prove some point, but when I addressed him, he was he said ""I don't need to explain myself"" glad that collaboration is over.

1qaf7qz,Day 5 - Marijuana is a Thief!!!,"I have been smoking everyday since about 15. I’m 41. All I can say is Marijuana is a THIEF! It robbed me of my memory, my money, my time, my sanity! I’m done with it! And I hope y’all are too!

Marijuana robbed my memory. It’s so shot now I have to live with the embarrassment when speaking to others and saying “oh wait, damn, I forgot what I was going to say. What were we just talking about again?” It’s even hard for me to think back and pull memories from when my kids were younger. There’s nothing worse to me as a dad than losing memories of your children. These memory issues are now affecting my career too. What a thief it is. 

Marijuana robbed me of my money. I easily spend over $300 per month on my addiction. It’s been this way for years. Add it up and that’s tens of thousands I could have put away for my kids or an emergency fund. Instead it went to the very thing destroying me today. 

Marijuana robbed me of my time. From the moment I’d wake up to the moment I fell asleep, I’d be smoking. Instead of coming straight home and giving my kids a hug and kiss. I’d run straight to the pipe and get my fix. I was smoking 15+ bowls a day, then a gram cart per day and I was spending hours a day outside, since I wouldn’t smoke indoors. It kept me away from my kids, my family, then I’d just be stuck on my phone as I was high and then realize I had been outside an hour and a half. So much time wasted. So much time I could have spent making better memories with my family instead. What a thief it is. 

The decades of smoking had killed my confidence, self-esteem, it’s weakened relationships, it’s made me lazy, unmotivated, afraid to speak in public, it’s made me grow to hate who I’ve become and lose respect for myself. I stumbled on a picture of myself the other day when I was about 5 years old. So innocent. Why did I let this happen to him!?

I’ve just had it. I can’t continue living like this anymore, this lie that it’s not the weed. It is! I don’t even know who the real me is anymore, because I haven’t been the real me since 9th grade. It’s even stolen my identity. 

I’m on day 5 and it’s been hard. Day 3 has been the worst. I just found this group though and listening to y’all has been extremely helpful to put things in perspective for me. It helped me realize how much I’ve lost smoking weed. No more though. I think what will help me get through it, is continuing to develop a strong hate for it. Perhaps that will help you too. Has it really made your life better or has it also robbed you of your money, time, sanity, etc? I think what prevented me from ever quitting before was a the part of me that would try to make weed sound harmless or that it wasn’t the main issue. F that! I’m not lying to myself anymore. It’s a F’ing thief! And I will no longer give that thief my money, my time, my energy, my motivation, my confidence, my life! 

It’s time to heal now. I know I might have it hard these next few months as I recover, but as a dad I’ll go through whatever I need to prevent losing the memories of my children. I’m ready to win this battle against marijuana this time. I owe it to myself and my family. 

Thanks to all of yall and this group for letting me vent. Sorry for the novel, but I feel so much better having shared this with someone.

1qadkmu,78 days clean :),"First I would not know what I’d do without this community. It has helped me tremendously in regards to staying clean. I was a heavy daily user and smoked pretty much every single day for the past 11 years. This is the  7th time I’ve tried to quit and the longest I’ve ever lasted without smoking. Something I came to realize (thanks to this Reddit) is that I am an addict and weed is my drug of choice. Knowing this changed my whole perspective on quitting. I would quit and then think “I can smoke a joint with my family and not get back into it”, which evidentially no I could not do that lol. Psychologically speaking, I’ve been way less anxious. I would smoke to calm my anxiety which ironically weed made it worse not better. I also haven’t been binge eating due to being high and having the munchies. I’ve been more active and more social as well. Financially, I’ve saved a ton by not buying weed all the time. Even though it’s been easier, there are still so many days where I’m tempted to smoke. I try my best and push through which makes me feel happy and accomplished that I didn’t give in.

1qa981w,Stopping weed,"I've smoked weed daily for the past 4 years. I turned 30 last month, and I've been planning to stop for a while now - 30s being my turning point.

Today is my 14th day without weed. I am quite determined that I won't start doing it again, but the impact of stopping is really fucking me up.

The first week was actually okay. It took me a bit to fall asleep, and my emotions were not very iregulated. But the second week has been horrible. I wake up feeling brain clouds, and I'm extremely sensitive (it doesn't take much for me to start crying). I've also started going to the gym, and changed my diet completely - and I recently just met someone that I really like, and I'm afraid that I'll just end up pushing them away and fucking it up, as well all of the progress that I've been making (since I overthink like crazy). At the moment, I feel like the worst version of myself - even worse than I was while being high out of my mind, and it's tough to hide it.

The dreams have also been horrible - I dream about my worst insecurities, and wake up feeling messed up, and the feeling lasts throughout the day. 

I used weed as a coping mechanism - dealing with my past relationship and childhood trauma. But it ended up isolating me completely from the world - I'm generally an anxious, introverted person (with an extroverted side that needs human conenction), and only now I see to which extent the weed hightened that. 

For those of you who stopped and had a similar experience - when does it get better? What was your recovery period like? I want to live and experience life, but my brain keeps telling that I'll never stop feeling like this, and thst weed messed my brain permanently.

Please be kind or I'll start crying again lmao",1768161323.0,8,4,leaves,substance
1qa8n3e,I was better off when i smoked (Please give advice on how to not feel like this),"Reference: 27F who did the do every day since about 2018 - late 2025. I did some pre-2018 in high school but it was always social. Once in college, it became a non-social activity and an addiction.

I've been sober since September and it feels like a lifetime. I had an opportunity to do it a few weeks ago but I didn't. My partner is very supportive of sobriety and I'm 27F who should have kids soon, so I've stopped for the better of my health. But honestly? I was so much more productive. I am an author on the side of my day job, and I wrote more, promoted more, did better at my job. Now I just feel mid all the time. I barely do anything productive. I suppose I was a ""functional"" stoner much like you hear of ""functional"" alcoholics. 

Logically, I know it is better to be sober. Of course it is. I don't want to be that future parent that does this stuff. I WANT to be the sober parent. But it is so hard to grapple with how lazy I have become.

PLEASE tell me it will get better. Because right now I feel as though I am going insane. I debated SO HARD today to go and get more at the store while my husband was at work, but I purposely stayed in PJ's to not do it. But I also avoided doing any appropriate work on my books, when the weekend is the best time to do so outside of my day job. I also became so bad at my last job that I quit (got a new one starting this past week) but I could tell my supervisors were getting sick of the sober me.

At work, I was so much more complacent when on weed, and became so much more grumpy and depressed when I quit. I could genuinely see how irritated my supervisors were at my performance once I got sober. I got a ""thank you"" goodbye card with all my coworkers writing a message and literally one supervisor wrote nothing. They used to like me, and openly tell me so, but once I became sober, they started to distance themselves and actively dislike me. And I can see why -- I became moodier and more resistant to what they were making us do.

Today’s weed is different. I used to laugh at those 25%+ labels like it’s just marketing. I don’t think it’s just marketing anymore, and I don’t think weed was supposed to be consumed at such potent levels. This isn’t scientific, but I from what I see, this is a newly occurring issue. This is the first time it’s happened to me, and I’ve paused cold turkey many times before, and it was the usual; racing mind, anger, chills, sweats, no sleep, nausea, no appetite, no focus… but liquid shit flying out my ass like Hoover’s dam??? Never before, never heard of before. Atleast for me it was unheard of. So I did some googling and found just 2 people posting about this and both within the past 2 years. There are a few websites that mention possibilities of diarrhea but it’s not as prevalent, most research focuses on the aforementioned symptoms. It seems rare, but it also seems more recent. Interesting thing to note as well is this all started after a farted and yellow mucus came out uncontrollably. Not a lot, maybe 1-2 oz of liquid goo came out and it smelled like deaths ass. This was also the case for another fellow who was quitting or lowering consumption. They shat themselves in the same manner I did, and it ensued the weeks of diarrhea. Link to that post will be in the comments bc it won’t let me post

I’ve got pedialyte, rice, applesauce, toast… I can give updates on this post to help others, I know it’s grueling to wonder how long a withdrawal is going to last but everyone is different.

I bought a candy bar over a week ago, and it’s still sitting in my bag, uneaten. This sounds silly, but that would’ve never happened while smoking. I could sit and have multiple candy bars, chips, cookies, all sorts of junk until I made myself sick. And still, every day, I would repeat the cycle. To put it further into perspective, with a normal diet, I’ve lost 6lbs since quitting. I’m fortunate to not have physical withdrawal symptoms, I know, and for that I am grateful. 

Mentally, the cravings still hit. I’m learning to distract myself, to hold on tight and let it pass. Read a book, go for a walk, play with my dogs, talk to my wife.

1qa3v3o,Experience after quitting daily THC. Day 7. Is this normal?,"Age 26. Smoked one joint every night after work for about two years. No morning or daytime use. Only evenings. I quit cold turkey last Saturday and today is day 7.

Some context of how the last days went:

Day 5: I had a sudden panic-like episode while driving at night. I had to stop the car and wait until it passed. It felt very physical and intense.

Day 6: High anxiety all day, low mood without a clear reason, intrusive sadness, almost like heartbreak but with no real-life trigger. In the evening it suddenly disappeared and I felt normal again. Slept well but had vivid dreams and night sweats.

Day 7 (today): I feel somewhat better. Still small waves of anxiety, but more manageable. I worked out at the gym and it helped. I also talked to a psychologist and read about cannabis withdrawal to understand if this is expected.

Previous use: one joint per day for two years. Stopped abruptly.

Questions for people with similar use patterns who quit cold turkey:

    1.	Does this progression sound familiar?
    
    2.	Is it normal for days 5-7 to be the hardest?
    
    3.	How long did the physical and emotional discomfort last for you?

1qa3k1f,Day 80 and some insights,"Been 80 days sober from my daily edibles. A few things I've learned:

- I still feel high sometimes, especially after a long day with little sleep or a hot shower. I dissociate a lot more often nowadays, but I do my best to never blame myself. Not something I can control. Do not blame yourself, it achieves nothing and makes it more difficult for you. 

- My cravings get more intense when I have a bad day. It's my way of needing escapism. I have zero cravings when I'm being social and productive with my days (grabbing lunch with a friend, going to the mall, etc.) I feel my most self and have a hard time noticing any symptoms when I am most active. 

- Your symptoms will have bad days and lighter days. It is a process. It will get worse before it gets better before it gets worse again and repeats. Some days, I feel unbearably cold, physically weak and exhausted. But most days, I feel better, like my body is ABOUT to get sick but still powering through.

- Endorphins and seratonin feel better and last way longer than ever before. I went on a vacation trip and came back home feeling happier, healthier and more secure in my happiness. Yes, the daily drugs gave me immediate ""happiness,"" but it is a fleeting fabricated feeling, and the long term and secure happiness you will gain from your sober life is unmatched. It enriches your outlook on life in general and keeps you pushing forward which is a great feat. As paralyzing as your bad days may feel, your good days can be very uplifting and inspiring as well.

I started smoking weed when I was 15, and from that point on, I’ve used it every single day.

It didn’t matter if I felt good or bad, stressed or bored, alone or with friends — I was always high. Multiple times a day. For 15 years straight, up until now.

At some point it stopped being about getting high or having fun. Weed — and drugs in general — became my way of managing everything: emotions, stress, boredom, sleep, social situations, even happiness. There was always something to take, no matter how I felt.

Now I want to stop. Completely.

What scares me isn’t just withdrawal.

What scares me is the confrontation with 15 years of my life that I’ve been numbing and postponing. I’ve never known myself as an adult without substances. I don’t know who I am without them, and that thought is terrifying.

I’m afraid of what will surface once I’m sober — emotions, regrets, missed opportunities, parts of myself I never developed. At the same time, I know that continuing like this isn’t really living anymore. Substances don’t help the way they used to. They numb more than they support.

I’m not quitting because someone told me to or because it’s “bad.”

I’m quitting because I feel stuck, and I don’t want to be 40 and still avoiding myself.

what the first weeks and months were like?

how long it took before you felt stable?

I doubt I will ever be. But now I have at least one day for every year I have smoked. It was casual for a long time but daily since I turned 25. I was a heavy flower user, not much into vapes or carts except at things like weddings and special occasions with mixed company. So that helped a lot.

If I can do it, anyone can. I was a heavy user and was very much identified and associated with the culture. I am always going to be an alternative hippie/punk type, I just do not need to be high to do so. Thank you all again, hang tough and I am gonna keep on keeping on.

1q9w9xt,Two weeks without weed today!,"Hello everyone, I posted here two months ago about quitting on new years. I received messages about how moving the date so far I'm still giving away to the addiction, and eventually moderators deleted my post, and messaged me that they hope that my next post would be about me being sober, and today I am happy to announce that I've been completely without weed for 14 days!

I spend November and December trying to cut down, and I did get about 10-15 days without in each month. I studied my triggers and when I run out on 28.12, I stopped. I used to smoke everyday multiple times a day for 1.5 years. Biggest reasons for quitting are that this wasn't who I am, my lifestyle doesn't support smoking and I was spending a lot of money. 

Today after the 2 week milestone I'm already noticing very positive changes in my life. My thoughts are clearler, I remember things that I would've forgotten if I was smoking, and I do everyday things with intention and I feel happier and more motivated. I was wery suprised that the change would happen this ""fast"" and for the last few days, there has been absolutely no cravings!! I feel extrelemely motivated and capable of being without smoking and I KNOW I can do this. I'm so proud that I had to share this update. 
I want to thank everyone that commented when I first posted. It has been very helpful and a part of why I have gotten this far today and feel so confident. Quitting has already been the best decicion of the year. ",1768127877.0,2,0,leaves,substance
1q9upbh,Clean for a whole year.,"This week marks 1 whole year without any weed.  I smoked several times a day every day for almost 25 years and when I quit it was really rough.  The first time I was really sick for 3 days and the second time I didnt sleep for about 3 days.

If you are struggling and maybe quit for the new year I just want you to know that a better life is possible.  

When I smoked I thought that it made life better but now I realize that it just numbed me and made my life worse.

I sleep better, eat better and have been far more productive over the last year then I ever was when I smoked.

Over the last year I have considered smoking a few times but I always managed to stay strong and refuse and I am better for it.

During COVID, I got into bad company and started smoking. I soon was chronically using and did for 4 years straight. 

Looking back, I lost my spark. I lost my genius. I lost my passion, my drive, my ambition, my bias to action. I became a slob. I never felt the bias to act in the world, to set and achieve goals, to grow and become something great. I coped by wrapping up my numbed internal state with philosophical nonsense I bastardized from the East. (The Eastern philosophies are wise, but can be used to escape.) **I produced a fake enlightenment that justified chronic weed addiction.** 

How much potential I gave up. 4 years that I will never get back. Some of the most formative years of my life. I feel so much sadness for this. Why did I do this? Why did I not wake up sooner? How did no one around me stop me? Why didn't I just ask for help? I struggle to cope with this.

**I refuse to let this be the end of my story.** I will make this the best thing to ever happen to me. I will let this fuel me in a way I never did. I will chase after big goals. I  will conquer the hardest things in front of me to make up for all the lost years. **I will be great because of this, not despite it.**

1q9rohu,30 days after 30 years,"I’m a 50M that has been a daily toker for 30 yrs minus a couple of breaks for job interviews/drug testing.  I probably qualify as ADHD and when I first got high as a junior in college it was like a revelation.  I was in a fraternity, but didn’t really connect with drinking culture and the way that so-called bros interacted with women and even other men.  I fell in love with weed and my new set of friends who were more reflective, introspective and sensitive than my previous world had allowed.  I’ve gone on to a successful career and have a great family, but I’ve never stopped smoking weed, and just thought that it was something that I would always do, even though I had grown to resent my dependance and my need to have it with me no matter where I was (work, family events, etc).  That resentment led me to this sub many years ago, but it never was enough to overcome my dependance.  But this year I planned a trip to Japan with the family for the holidays.  A couple of weeks before the trip I casually went online to see how I would get my fix while overseas, only to discover that you don’t want to FAFO in Japan with weed or any other drugs (besides alcohol which is omnipresent lol).  Anyway I decided it was time to finally take a break and did the first week of abstinence before the trip.  No fun at all.  That said, by the time we were traveling a felt a level of independence that I hadn’t yet felt as an adult.  A layer of shame that I was only subconsciously aware of lifted as well, which was empowering AF.  I just landed back stateside today and am now at day 30 weed-free.  I guess I just want to say that even if you don’t think you need to at least take a break, and you are on this sub and reading this, then you should just go ahead and take that break.  It hasn’t always been fun for me these last 30 days, but it has been enlightening, in more ways than one.  It actually has been like being high on a new drug to abstain given my ritual de lo habitual over the last 30 yrs, only it has been shame-free, and actually free.  Nice combo.  Give it a shot.  And if you need the arm twist like I apparently did, then I suggest booking a trip to a place where you can’t get away with being the old you.  Japan worked for me, and I feel a vigor that I’m not ready to let go of just yet.

I completely stopped smoking weed now 8 weeks ago after smoking daily for around 3 years. I feel so much better in every aspect except for my sleep.

I am still having very vivid dreams literally every single night even 2 months after quitting, and it's waking me up literally every time around 2-3 am and again at 5 am.

I  know that the vivid dreaming is part of the withdrawal process but I didnt expect it to go on for 2 months after quitting without any signs of improvement. How long did this go on for you and do you have suggestions on what I can do?

I don't drink or take any other substances, I avoid eating and exercising before going to bed, as well as consuming intense media before falling asleep. I also don't want to start using medication but I'm starting to go crazy without a single good night of sleep.

1q9piyg,Lacking purpose and direction and why it might be my biggest trigger.,"Good evening everyone. I hope you’re all doing well, having a good Saturday, and managing your situations as best as you can.

I’m home alone tonight and wanted to share something that happened to me today.

For a bit of context, I’m 21 years old, and my older brother is 27. He’s more established in life, someone who could be considered “successful,” but I’ve noticed that he’s also struggling to quit smoking. He told me he plans to stop in 2026, so today I went to check his stash to see if he still had weed or if he had actually stopped. I ended up finding weed there.

In that moment, I felt two emotions at the same time. The first one was the obvious urge to smoke. When the substance is right in front of you, it’s almost hypnotizing for a few seconds. The second emotion was sadness, because my brother is in a similar situation to mine, and I know quitting is probably hard for him too.

That situation made me reflect deeply. I didn’t smoke, and honestly, I truly believe I wasn’t going to. But the temptation was strong, and it made me think about why I get these urges, why my desire to smoke feels so intense, and why this addiction still has such a grip on me. I feel like a big part of it comes from a lack of purpose.

Again, for context, I’m 21 years old. I work with my dad in our family business, but I still haven’t found my place there. I contribute, but nothing significant enough to feel like I’m truly moving the business forward. At university, I never really found my place either. I don’t really have friends anymore. The only friends I had lived abroad, and we only talked online after graduating high school. I eventually cut ties with them because our mindsets and purposes didn’t align. They were into partying and drugs, and whenever I talked about my problem with weed, they minimized it and laughed it off. You know, that typical mentality that weed isn’t addictive, that it only has power if you give it power, that it’s not that serious. They never really understood me, so I decided to distance myself.

All of this made me realize that I genuinely don’t know what I’m doing with my life. I don’t know what my purpose is or what path I should take. I don’t know if I should focus more on work, making money, and building something there, or if I should focus more on my religion and becoming more spiritual. I honestly don’t know.

I feel like the loneliness, boredom, and lack of direction have worn me down. On one hand, I know I’m handling my addiction much better than I did in the past, and I don’t feel like I’m about to relapse. I don’t think I’m going to smoke. But on the other hand, I feel mentally exhausted. I’m tired of dealing with the same problems, the same unanswered questions, and the same unfinished thoughts in my head. The mental fatigue is real.

I’m 21 years old and I’ve never had a girlfriend. It’s not that I’m unattractive. I’ve been told I’m at least somewhat attractive. But I have zero confidence when it comes to talking to women. I don’t know what to do at work. I don’t know what to do in university. I don’t know what to do in my personal life or my love life. I just feel stuck, like my hands are tied.

I’ve been dealing with the same issues for a long time. Sometimes I deal with them sober, sometimes under the influence, but overall, not knowing what I’m doing with my life makes staying sober much harder. I’m trying to handle things the best I can, and for now, I don’t plan on giving up. But the mental fatigue is very real, and I honestly don’t know what to do.

1q9muun,"32 years old  and 4 days completely sober , feels great not using after 17 years of heavy use.","Hey guys , just wanted to share my experience with stopping weed after 17 years of extremely heavy use. Started smoking when I was 15 and basically have smoked all day every day since then. Started out being fun and enjoying it like everyone does , but after this long I just started to feel like it wasn’t beneficial anymore. 

Because of my job (tattoo artist )I have been in an environment where I could smoke all day and be high openly at work. I would smoke before,during and after work every single day.probly in the neighborhood of 5-7 grams of flower per day .I even justified it by telling myself ( and anyone else who would listen) that it made me more creative or patient or social, and hell at some point those things might have even been true . However recently it has totally stopped feeling that way. 

The thing that really pushed me to stop was deciding to try having a child with my wife. Once we made the decision to start trying I first quit drinking ( something I also did daily ) so far I’m about 2 weeks off booze as well. But after gaining some clarity from that I decided to just go all in and try actually being fully sober .

And honestly it has been feeling great ! Today is the 4th day for me without smoking at all. The first few days were a little harder and I did find myself quite irritated initially but as I sit here writing this I can honestly say I feel different ! In a good way . 

Basically I just wanted to say finding this group and reading some of your stories has inspired me to keep going.I don’t know if it’s going to be forever but it feels great for now . I’m looking forward to feeling my emotions fully  again, pursuing hobbies and artistic interests more and reconnecting spirituality( something I used to think cannabis helped with ,however now I believe it has done the opposite ). These last few days have really made me realize what haze I have been living in. 

So yeah pretty much just wanted to say that I appreciate you all for being open and honest and would love to hear anyone’s advice moving forward . ",1768097224.0,75,16,leaves,substance
1q9ml4c,Notes from Marijuana Anonymous meeting,"Getting high became the activity. Usually I would do things like watch a movie or play video games after getting high but after a few years I would get high on marijuana day and night and do nothing and look straight.

  
It was getting sort of old. This is the time it became a gateway drug to harder drugs like many people say that marijuana is a gateway drug so this is another reason it is not safe to consume marijuana.

  
I thought it was cool but in reality, in front of most if not all people I was a fool.

  
There was no other way to live. I would struggle day and night behind marijuana and marijuana was all I thought about day and night. How to buy it next time, where to get the money, what I will do after I am high.

  
I didn't feel any regret. I didn't learn a thing. This is how I felt until after around 10 years of smoking marijuana I started feeling regret about lost time and wasting my life away.

  
I was stealing money and taking money from my parents and also orphan donation money to smoke marijuana. I also sold many of my laptops and handheld consoles and games at the pawn shop to smoke marijuana and get high. I would also steal empty beer bottles from the restaurants and sell it at the gas station to get some money for marijuana first with friends and then I would do this alone.

  
I had anxiety and depression from getting high instead of feeling relaxed. Drinking coffee while high on marijuana added to the anxiety.

  
I was deep into all kinds of addictions for example cigarettes and coffee. It was one of many bad habits.

  
I couldn't control this addiction and would justify getting high and wasting my life away 10 to 15 years.

  
I struggle more to stay sober from marijuana than other drugs because I think that it is healthy to smoke marijuana and that it has many medical benefits. I forget how bad it actually is for me.

  
I went in the garbage to get weed that I threw out and also on the floor outside far away from my house.

  
I relapsed many times after quitting. I would quit for 2 months and 5 to 6 months to 1 year and then justify getting high again saying to myself that I would smoke once a week or once a month or only in the evening, but I would end up getting high from when I wake up until when I sleep every day for months and years for 10 to 15 years.

  
I felt anger and fear instead of relaxation and medical benefits. I would not feel the medical benefits because I smoked half a pack of cigarettes a day along with a marijuana joint every 2 to 3 hours.

  
I admit that I am powerless over my marijuana addiction. I then pray to God to help me and make techniques to quit. This method takes several months to work. Online Marijuana Anonymous meetings are also one of the main things that help me quit smoking marijuana thanks a lot to everyone there.

  
My faith in myself in myself was shattered because of the depression and loss of control over my marijuana addiction.

  
It took months to quit every time. Sometimes it took more than a year to quit. With the help of Marijuana Anonymous meetings I was able to quit in several months instead of years.

  
Hope this helps people out there in the same situation as me.

Where is the benefit? I am still anxious -well, not super anxious, mostly around food- I feel even more tired and less motivated than before.

I quitted because got tired of looking “for the perfect weed”. Sooner or later all of them didn’t felt well after a few days of smoking them.

The first time I smoked I think I was 14… I remember do not liking it at all. But for some reason… I kept doing it. Not everyday, but with friends and whatever. Until at some point, I realized it made me break down some inhibitions and I found myself on it. 

Sometimes it was really fun and made me laugh so much. 

I was an occasional smoker -every other weekend- until I reached 23 and it became daily. Then I slowed down. 

For the past 20 years I have periods of smoking more or less. With months without and then coming back. Some seasons daily, other once every other week.

All my life I had anxiety spiraling ‘attacks’ and weed helped me when I couldn’t stop getting on my head. One puff of the right hybrid helped me to stop and gain new perspective.  But now, I finally treated myself and found the right meds balance. It took me to be 41yo to seek psychiatric help and two years of trying different things, I found a combo that balanced me out and made me “normal”.

So now, it feels like weed doesn’t have a real use in my life, and I don’t want to just get lazy, undermotivated, feel tired all the time. But after 10 days… I feel the same but without smoking…

1q9ljq5,hardest thing I have ever done,"I wanted to share my experience hoping that it can help others with the intensity of quitting weed. I found a lot of solace and support at 2am in these ""quitting"" threads when I was raging out of my brain during my journey.

I am a 67 year old who has smoked pretty much all my life. I describe myself as a hard charger type A who has had the fortune to always have a job I love, made good money and never wanted for anything material. For me, pot was a fun social thing, it wasn't until my late 40's when my personal life changed (divorce). I got screwed over pretty bad by my X and it wasn't about money or property, it was the lack of trust and the hurt I felt from her cheating, lying and such. Anyway, I repressed those feelings and just charged onward-getting high and telling myself I was strong and didn't need anyone. I went 18 years before I let myself get involved in another relationship. It's easy to protect yourself when it is just you.

During COVID, I met a nice girl via friend and we started a relationship.  After 5 years (last Octoberish), I had trust issues, not because my current GF did anything, but because I had carried that shit from my previous marriage, locked up in the corner of my brain never coming to terms with it. Well, I finally realized at 67, I was living wrong by not dealing with these feelings for all these years, masking them and I was shorting my current relationship for something that was not her fault. I needed to come to terms with those feelings.

13 Dec 2025, I decided it was time, stop the madness, get clean, talk to her in detail and let her in so we could move forward in a healthy way and not with me secretly hiding my insecurities. Build our relationship on us, not my past. Stop repressing my past feelings and share them so I could work past them in a healthy way. So now the quitting.

This is hands down the hardest thing I have ever been through in my life. Luckily, I started this journey over the holidays, and I have a ton of vacation (still working and love my job) so I could afford to quit and not let it affect my work. I took a month off. My girlfriend is totally supportive and been a rock for me throughout this. I also stopped all alcohol, so I went for it BIG TIME.

Week 1 the sense of feeling good, I was taking positive steps towards health and honesty, not only with my girlfriend, but myself. Good stuff, let's go, I got this.

Week 2 real shit starts to happen. Insomnia, lack of appetite, overall feeling of malaise and a lostness. That's when I started reading these Reddit pages and knew I was not alone nor crazy, this is part of the journey I had to be willing to accept.

Week 3. The absolute worst for me to date. The physical pain in the gut, no sleep, body re-setting and body systems purging and trying to correct all of the shit I had done to myself. There were quite a few times I felt on the edge. Not of doing something stupid or relapsing, but just no focus and lack of ""control"" of my mind. That is the hardest part for me, having to succumb to out of the blue anxiety and mind running.  I am weird like that, the harder it gets, the more resolve I have to stay strong and quit both alcohol and weed. I was never a big drinker but realized if I am gonna get control of my mind and body, I have to rebalance fresh and get totally clean. So, for me, that was never an issue thankfully. I am a bullheaded mofo sometimes.

Week 4, this week, I finally got to sleep for 5 hours Thursday night. Last night I slept for 6 hours and was able to take a nap today for 3 hours. Dreams are murky for now and real REM sleep is yet to come, but I feel like it is close. Today is the best I have physically felt in 4 weeks. I still have some anxiety but the combination of being honest with myself about my past feeling/repressions and knowing I am not crazy helps immensely.

I am far from done, there are still weeks ahead of work, but I feel for the first time in a month, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and I control that light.

My symptoms:

I suffered with insomnia, anxiety and mind warping, i.e. mind running wild with seemingly no control at times. I felt like Wyle E Coyote strapped to a rocket and someone lights the fuse without me knowing, then I am along for the ride. No headaches, no diarrhea, no sweats. Everyone will feel different effects.

Know you are not alone. Know it is a hard journey, but one worth taking.  Pot is addictive and is a psychoactive DRUG. Combined with alcohol, even small amounts, is BAD for your mental state, especially if you are less than 100% in your feelings and emotional wellbeing. Be honest with yourself and allow yourself to hurt, cry and work through those feelings. Until you come to terms with those (assuming you have them), you can never really heal. The mind controls all the physical of your body; you must treat the mind as you purge/clean the body.

Stay strong and find some support from someone. Confide in people you trust and keep telling yourself IT IS NOT EASY, BUT IT IS WORTH IT.

This post is my first one and I just wanted to add to the list of people who are taking this journey and want others who are making this journey to know, you can do it. Don't give in, accept that it is hard, it will be painful, both physically and emotionally but like most things in life worth having, it is worth working for-

Thank you to all those that posted their experience, it has been a god send for guys like me who think they are tough and can handle anything. Reading these posts at 2am when I was surging with anxiety and emotion, helped me sooo much. I am not crazy.

1q9jgxb,Honestly at a loss.,"33 M been smoking weed for over 15 years and recently smoked pens 1 gram each day live resin for about 3 years straight. All day long .

I finally quit. Cold turkey, I’m day 10.

4 days ago if you seen my thread I was so positive, so full of life and proud of myself that I’m quitting this drug. I started to feel so good about myself.

Now it’s the weekend, I’m trying to keep busy, but honestly now I just feel so fucking down. So low. No motivation. Complete opposite of what I was feeling. 

I’m trying to keep busy with gym and stuff around the house but I’m just finding myself absolutely miserable. I have a 3 year old with autism so things are already more difficult at home and I do everything I can. My wife quitting soon but still smoking in morning and night and I just feel so fucking miserable like I don’t even want to be here anymore. 

Just realy sucks because I’m about a stone throw away of smoking again. 

I hope it gets better where I’m naturally happy, because right now I feel being miserable is my actual personality and I hate that. 

Trying so fucking hard to keep it together 

I know this is part of the process… I quit last year and fell back into the trap. I just feel so guilty like I’m not being by their mentally for my family. 

UPDATE: Today is day 11 for me now, I think I got the best sleep of my life. I slept for roughly 10 hours…. It was a really rough day yesterday mentally…. But wouldn’t be nearly as bad as it could have been if I smoked. I’m so glad I turned to Reddit rather than hitting up the dispensary and buying a thc pen again. I’d be waking up with shame and guilt. Thank you to all of you that took a few moments of your day to help me out. Love you all, thanks so much guys. 🫶💪🙏",1768088447.0,33,42,leaves,substance
1q9ikgt,Does the anxiety ever subside? 6 weeks without weed now and wondering if it ever goes away,"Hello.  I know 6 weeks isn't very long and from reading A lot of these threads its seems like I am in for a long ride of anxiety and depression. I appreciate the success stories but doesnt feel like that is ever going to be me. I read them wondering how people function on a day to day basis with the anxious thoughts and feelings of dread and doo.  Im wondering if people have ever felt this tremendous anxiety go away for a long period of time.  I struggle with anxiety and depression but it  feels like the anxiety in my chest is always there. 

I smoked for 20 years and It felt like it was making things worse over the last 6 months or even more. I miss being able to just sit and relax on the couch and watch a movie.  I miss the calm mind that I have had at times in my life that just seems to be replaced with more and more anxiety. 

I work out, exercise, practice jiu-jitsu and get some relief but it always comes back.  I try other forms of 'prescribed medications' and it goes away for a little bit and always returns. 


The hardest part is knowing that im doing all the right things. Staying sober on all levels.  I work at a bar security/bouncing 3-4 nights a week and I will say going to work and having a place to be and being around people seems to help with the anxiety at times.  But i also find myself just having conversations with myself in my own mind wondering why I cant be the confident, charming, funny guy I once was.  
I wonder if I will ever be ok?  I wonder if the anxiety will ever be relieved.

1q9igao,4 months and 23 days off the sauce,"this is the longest i have gone since i was about 23 years old. i am 40. i smoked every day. most days i would wait til evening but some days i'd go on a wake n bake bender. 

twice i tried to quit and made it to 90 days. the first time, i felt i was ""too happy"" and thought i was ""missing epiphanies"" so i smoked again for a few years. 

the second time i was dating someone, who, after 90 days convinced me (it wasn't that hard to convince me) that a ""medical dose"" was absolutely ok...yet we would hit the bong, take gummies, edibles, and get completely fucked up. the medical dose thing lasted like, a day.

this is the first time in my life i haven't struggled to quit. i knew a long time ago i didn't need it as the crutch i was leaning on, i knew it in 2019. i had a heart to heart with myself and knew i could walk away, but i still clung to it. 

quitting is fucking hard. the sweats, the nausea, the sleep disturbance, the intense dreams. and i did it through a brutal breakup too, after my sister discarded me as well. might as well get it all over with at once, right?

i feel so energetic now, i feel so CLEAR. i feel so CONFIDENT. socially, like ZERO social anxiety. i'm not in my head, i'm not dumb, i'm not slow. i'm feeling everything so INTENSELY. my normal adhd hyperactivity and speed is back online and I LOVE IT. i was dulling and slowing myself to fit into normie energy but i do not want to do that ever again.

honestly i feel like a real grown up, i am proud of myself, i feel more authentic, like all systems are firing, like i'm in control, and i don't need a crutch, anything to slow me down, numb me out, an alibi, or a buddy. i feel solid as me, my natural self. i feel so good i could cry!

if you've been on the fence or have a deeper knowing but still rationalize it...just quit. sobriety really is the drug. reality is miraculous and unbelievable as-is.",1768085849.0,3,3,leaves,substance

1q9d6fy,Day 10 Update & What worked for me,"Hi all - wanted to put this out there to share my sobriety journey. I thought whoever reads this could make sure that they are not alone. 

A bit context: i used a pen everyday during 2025 to induce sleep mostly, but anytime i had free time i found myself hitting my pen. it got to a point where i was just in bed all day everyday. i knew i had a problem with weed for the past 2 years but i only had the balls to try quitting this NYE. 

Days 1-3 WERE MISERABLE. I was crying unstoppable, had severe heart palpitations, headache, severe insomnia and depressed as hell. this was also the strongest period of cravings. 

Days 4-7 I found myself willing to go out, did some shopping, spent time with myself, and realized how much i missed doing that. this time around the nightly sweats got worse and worse besides the constipation. On day 4 talking to my bank advisor with a sober head felt so much different. I felt alive. Connected. Present. Smart. I loved that shit. 

Days 8-10 Cravings are fewer than it has ever been. I’ve tried alcohol on day 9 to try inducing sleep and it was a big mistake. I woke up extremely tired, unlike other days where I felt energized despite getting 5> hrs of sleep. 

I am now on day 10. Still constipated and insomniac. I dont have any other physical symptoms left, except for spotting (see the last part). I have ZERO intentions to go back to being a daily smoker because I hate how it made me bound to my bed all alone. After that ~1 week of hell, I am doing so much better. 

For those who are struggling. Please know that you are not alone. Know that your brain will try to trick your mind for a while, because its a prediction machine. It predicts the compound to enter your body and poison you. If you don’t give it what it wants, it cries like a five year old and causing craving storms. Remember that your mind is much stronger than a prediction machine. You can say no to it. I know its extremely hard, but its not impossible when you are ready. 

If you are here, I think you are either ready to stop, already stopped, or considering stopping. I wanted to share what helped me so maybe some of you can use it too. 

1- Introspection: I think I clearly identified what made me super addicted- In 2021, I dealt with the loss of my best friend who was only 19 and had a heart attack. By that time, the tree probably saved my life but now i can clearly see how it doesnt serve me anymore. I have been extremely embarrassed when I compared myself to my parents who are both high achievers and never touched weed. 

2- Reframing: I used to love the compound (a part of me still do) but I tell myself I dont like it anymore. I tell myself its not a part of my identity. I tell myself that i enjoy my sobriety because it helps me be myself again. The brain makes this its new reality with repeated reframing. My confidence and energy levels came back significantly. 

3- Healthy Distractions: Cleaning, walking, reading, music, talkibg to a loved one have helped me distract my brain from craving it. I am happy to get things done during the distraction periods. It makes me feel useful. 

4- Sniffing my pen: Okay this is probably quite unusual lmao. But hear me out. The brain has associated the smell with the relaxation, therefore even a slight cue helps with relaxation and helps avoiding to hit it. I ask myself how I’d feel if I hit this instead of just sniffing. The answer is shit. So i avoid it. It might not work for everyone, but I am determined not to smoke and having the smell makes me feel “safe” otherwise my mind would probably drag me to a dispensary. Here comes reframing too. I sniff, and I tell myself similar things to change how I feel about using. 

I have barely any problems with my appetite because i always avoided consuming before eating. However, I’m a 22 yo female and i think i got an early period. Can anyone relate to the experience with periods? 

Seeing how f’d up my body is during withdrawal is/was SO scary and became the reason why i never wanna go back to it. I hope this will help at least one person to keep continuing their sobriety journey. 

We got this.

1q9d5sa,Help! I can't stop smoking weed!,"My weed habit has gotten out of control. I smoke everyday. The only time I don't get high is when I have to work in the office which is just a few days a week. Even on my work from home days I'll smoke while working. Weekends I'll wake up, have a cup of coffee and smoke a joint. Then keep smoking throughout the day. 

I'm not a productive smoker. I basically end up on the couch, surfing the web, playing video games, watching movies, etc. All of the errands and goals for the day just go out the window. If I do accomplish something like exercise or cooking; I immediately reward myself with a joint. When it's time for bed and I'm super high I tell myself ""okay that's it you need to get more done and stop smoking so much."" But the cycle continues. 

I've been smoking for over 20 years. I live alone so I don't really have anyone who can call me out on my behavior. I've been telling myself to quit for years but I always find an excuse and  tomorrow will be the day I quit. The other day I even canceled a date because I wanted to go home and get high.

The worst part for me isn’t even being high or not  it’s what cravings did to my self-respect. Weed is hard to get where I live, and when cravings hit I’d ask people for favors, get ignored or hung up on, and still call again. That shame hurts more than withdrawal.
Right now I have no weed at all, so this is an unplanned stop. I also have work deadlines this week, which scares me.
I’m struggling with anxiety, irritability, headaches, and even nicotine cravings even though I’m not a smoker.

I always blamed alcohol and have been alcohol-free for over 1.5 years. This time however, I didn’t have any alcohol and was not sick with the flu or COVID, no pancreatitis, no gallbladder issues. They ran tests and did bloodwork and nothing came back positive (thankfully). I mentioned my cannabis intake was many joints a day and explained my symptoms that include severe upper abdominal pain, constant nausea, chills, fever and that the only relief was scalding hot showers.

 Things I miss about being sober is going to sleep early and waking up refreshed to take a morning walk/jog. Getting to work on time and in a good mood full of energy. Reading a book to completion. Playing games with my friends without raiding the fridge between matches  cause of the munchies and bathroom breaks to prevent dehydration. Reading my Bible and getting closer to God. Feeling a sense of everything is gonna be okay. Cooking nutritional meals that digest properly. 

Things I don't miss dabbing. Choking on air cause my respiratory system is janky due to tar and oil and inflammation. Feeling hungry for all the wrong things. Constipation is the worse and seems incurable without major laxatives. Feeling detachment from reality and having a idgaf mentality cause I'm an empath and I really do gaf. Not reaching my goals cause my altered state of mind makes excuses as to why doing something is good when my common sense knows it's bad. Looking for love in all the wrong places. Porn is a big issues since I broke up with my ex. Getting 9-10hrs of sleep while feeling like I only got 4-6. Crashing out on people cause of seemingly stupid questions and small talk when I usually like small talk. Spacing out in the pause menu on a game cause I'm so lit. Spacing out at work cause I'm so lit etc... just done feeling stupid.

I've been through the full detox many times from weed/dabs. I know all the steps and requirements to make it as painless as possible and I'm blessed for that. Everything will be fine and I have plenty of coping practices that come to the rescue such as breathing exercises for anxiety 4sec in 6sec out. Drinking lots of water to prevent dehydration from detox sweats. Eating nutritional meals and avoid carbs unless paired with bulk protein and veggies. No junk food whatsoever IM SERIOUS. Junk food will make you sick and feel like death so be careful choosing sweets cause they mess everything up due to inflammation. I feel alternative sweets that use monk fruit or alternative sugars are more acceptable as well as gluten free. Have a routine which is very important. Find a breakfast food you like and stick to it and make it bland unless u can handle spices. Talk to your friends or make some friends. Talk to your pastor or find a counselor that has there life together to try and copy some success tips. Go to the gym or workout at home routinely. If you start to sweat for no reason seemingly start to work out and give yourself an excuse to sweat also bring a fan and some water. Self regulation is happening in real time so pay attention to the signs. My top 3 troubleshoot tactics are did I drink water? Did I eat? Did I exercise enough. Usually lack of water is the issue due to stress sweat. Anyways I think that's everything I'm ready to start my full detox again. Think I'm finally at the age where it's lost its charm. Opening doorways to better jobs it's also a bonus although my next move is finally starting my business so I have something to look forward to. Stay positive and keep in contact with happy people and you will be happy.

At first I was calling it ""anger"" but I think that isn't quite right. It's more like EVERYTHING irks me. Little things. Innocuous things. My nervous system is just raw.

Today my partner was telling me something he was planning to do (sign up at a new gym), and I got really worked up about the way he was explaining his decisions. He could tell that I was getting irritated with him and he said, ""What's wrong with you?"" That hurt, but I also get why he said it. I don't feel  like myself.

Since quitting, I've noticed some really ugly behaviors. I've used my car horn multiple times. I even flashed my high beams at someone because they were hesitating too long to make a turn. This is not the man I want to be.

For context: I did a 30-day break back in September, but it was meant to be an experiment to just see if I could do it. The detox period was brutal then too, and I know the chaotic mind stuff did eventually cool down...but I don't recall being quite so emotionally raw that time. Maybe knowing that it was a 30 day experiment then helped.

How did you get through the irritability phase without damaging relationships or hating yourself?

Did anything actually help (mindset, routines, anything)? Or do I just wait this out?

During my months of sobriety I know I’m the happiest I’ve ever been. It’s scary to think looking back that I could tell you with 100% certainty during those seasons that I’d NEVER want to smoke again, that “wasn’t me” anymore. It wasn’t like I’d relapse when something went significantly wrong in life.. in fact the opposite. I’d relapse when I had convinced myself I had gotten so in control of my habit that I’d think that “one time won’t hurt” even though I know that’s not true. That one hit reverted me back to heavy, daily use every. single. time.

Every day since I relapsed again May 2025 I watched myself go through the same cycle, starting again and telling myself it’s fun again, adding only good to my life up, until now… self loathing, guilt, and deep regret. It’s almost worse knowing how cognizant I am of my poor decisions and watching myself continue anyways. 

I work a high stress job in health care, constant chatter in my brain all day. It was always a race to get home so I could smoke.. otherwise I would be a raging bitch to anyone around me and couldn’t tolerate or have any patience for anything else. You know the discomfort and anxiety. 

I’m posting again for accountability. I can’t go through this cycle again. I’m wishing everyone the best.

Does anyone have any advice on how to abstain/quit in a measured, non-daunting way? My biggest issue, I’ve found, is breaking the routine, the ritual of it. On days I work, all I can think about it coming home and having that first toke. On my days off, I use weed to punctuate tasks (ie, I’ll smoke and then I’ll do my laundry, I’ll smoke and then I’ll shower… etc etc). When my routine is broken and I can’t smoke, ie if I’m staying with relatives or I’m on holiday, I adjust absolutely fine. If anything, it’s a relief! I want to know how I can achieve that break in routine without actually… breaking my routine, I guess? I mean that as in: I know I can do something to get myself physically out of the environment I associate with smoking, but… it’s still my home, lol. I’ll have to return to it eventually. 

Also, I say “un-daunting” because would you believe… my marijuana usage has been hiding some complex mental health issues, ha! I’m autistic and not very good at leaving my comfort zone, trying new things, and I hate sweating. I need to be coaxed into things, have the steps broken down, rather than just be presented with the end goal. If you tell me “you should replace weed with a new social activity, like a club” I will categorically not just… go out there and do that. But what could the first step to that be, if that were a goal of mine?

1q8zcu8,Focus on the positive (I hope to motivate you by sharing this),"I have been trying to quit weed multiple times, and of course it is not easy, but I found that when you THINK it is going to be very hard, it WILL be very hard. 
Many people are sharing their experiences here, and a lot of them can be quite negative (and of course everyone is totally free to share this) but I realised in my current attempt (I'm at day 8) that this actually really demotivated me. 

So I really wanted to make a positive post without sugarcoating. 

My thoughts while quitting are really different this time. In previous attempts I'd always think whenever I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat well, would feel anxious; ""If I had a joint now everything would go away and I will feel like myself again"". This is NOT true. It is the weed that caused you to have these withdrawal symptoms in the first place. It's your enemy, not your friend. And I have learned to bend my negative thoughts in something positive:

- Yes, it takes a while to fall a sleep, but I kept a journal about each night and have noticed that each night, I slept a bit earlier than the night before. From staying awake to 4 am in the morning, I slept at 2 am yesterday. And I make myself super comfortable in bed so that staying awake is not so bad at all (nice cup of tea, watching a TV show, reading). I don't force myself to close my eyes when I'm not sleepy yet because this makes me irritated. I just chill and wait until I really feel the sleepyness coming and then it only takes me 20 mins or so to sleep.

- Yes, my appetite was somewhat gone for a few days, but I'm already starting to get hungry on my own again (I used to need weed for that) and yesterday I truly enjoyed a meal again.

- Yes, I have had some anxiety and depressive thoughts, but it's simply my brain trying to restore it's natural physiology. And I know this already improves after a week or so, and that I will feel so much more stable, happy and confident. Yesterday I had some happy moments and this indicates my brain is already starting to make more dopamine on its own! 

- Yes, I've had weird dreams. But my REM sleep is back! I'm finally processing things again in my sleep which will benefit me so much on the long run. And these weird dreams are also very temporary.

In addition:
- My brain already feels so much clearer when I wake up in the morning.
- My skin looks so much better, my face does not look so tired all the time.
- My gut health has already improved tremendously (from not eating all that garbage junk food while high, I guess)

Am I still in withdrawal? Yes, but the point is that I feel improvements every day, and I celebrate each of them instead of focusing on the withdrawal itself. And everything is temporary. I am so excited for 1 month abstinence, which is only 3 weeks from now.

1q8xo77,The reason it’s working out better for me this time and why it can help you too!!!,"Good evening everyone. I am here, sitting in my room on a Saturday night. It is two in the morning and I am reflecting, and I want to share some thoughts with you that I truly believe can help. To begin, I want to say that in the past, a Saturday night like this was usually the time when I smoked the most. So naturally, lying here in my bed, doing nothing, watching YouTube, the thought crosses my mind. It would be pretty fun to smoke a joint and listen to music.

But if there is one thing that has really helped me this time not to go back to where I was, or not to give in to those thoughts and temptations, it is that now I feel much more aware of when my mind is romanticizing a past that no longer exists. Yes, there was a time when smoking was fun. There was a time when it was not a problem, when I enjoyed it and it felt new and harmless. But at the end of the addiction, that was no longer the case.

Maybe you did smoke, and maybe there were moments of enjoyment, but if you are here in this forum, it is because that was not the main feeling it left you with. This time it has been much easier for me to stop because when those thoughts come into my head, I understand that my mind is romanticizing a distant past that is already gone.

When I stopped smoking, I was miserable. I felt physically bad every single day. Mentally I felt weak, physically I felt weak. I felt bad about myself. I felt lonely. I felt sad, but a deeper kind of sadness. And it is very important that we learn to recognize when our mind is romanticizing things or trying to create an illusion that does not exist.

It is important for you to realize that if right now you give in to the temptation, if you follow those thoughts, if you go and buy a joint and smoke it, it will not be the way you imagine it. You will not enjoy it as much as you think. You will not feel as good as you believe you will. You will feel bad. You will feel disappointed in yourself, and you will fall back into the same hole you were in before.

I know myself. If I smoke a little and sit here listening to music, I will not be satisfied. I will want more and more, and I will create an emptiness I cannot fill, and all my physical problems will come back as well. Think realistically. Do not think with your emotions. Think with your head. Use logic. Why am I here? Why did I have to stop? Why can I not go back to the substance?

If you are able to ask yourselves these questions, you will be able to conclude that you had to stop because it was the right thing to do, and that you cannot go back. I understand how you feel. Right now is the time of the week when I feel the strongest urge to smoke. Sitting on my bed on a Saturday night, the temptation is strong, very strong. But we have to know how to recognize that this is not reality.

Reality is not that feeling that everything will be fine and enjoyable. Reality is that we would go back to the same misery we were living in before.

And if you quit smoking recently and you feel miserable at least know that your misery comes from a place of trying to improve, when you smoke the misery doesn’t come with any benefits, only harming yourself and delaying the inevitable. ",1768029327.0,111,17,leaves,substance

I’ve been working a lot on my anxiety and depression this year and have made a lot of progress but today I experienced a couple old triggers and just felt like everything backslid for hours on end and I was unable to regulate and was so tempted to smoke just to numb everything and feel “normal”. I feel so ashamed of the way my brain feels out of my control sometimes. 

One reason I’m quitting is to be sure that weed isn’t actually the thing causing my anxiety to be worse, instead of self medicating it. I’ve read the first week can be a peak for mood swings, I’m hoping this doesn’t happen too often but also know that it’s a signal for a need for other coping mechanisms.

1q8v7x9,Can’t figure out my why,"I’ve had depression all my life and before weed I wasn’t really feeling this whole ‘being alive’ thing. Once I found weed, I felt like I always had a back up plan. Like if I found myself in the pit (that’s what I call my worst days) I could get high instead of… you know.

I’ve never really been that excited to be here to be honest, weed just made things tolerable. Or so I tell myself. I’m starting to suspect that that’s the addiction talking. And I think I owe it to myself to figure out what life is like as a sober adult. I feel like I never really gave it a fair shake. I might even surprise myself, right??

My problem is this: hope, when you have depression, is fleeting. In the early stages of sobriety, hope comes and goes every 30 minutes. I am 32 now, used almost daily for 4 years, and before that I was depressed and lost. Doing what I felt like I ‘should be doing’ but having no passion or ambition behind anything. 

I don’t know why I’m here. I don’t know what I’m living for. And there are moments where I’m hopeful that something good will come out of this but other moments where this shit feels too hard to be worth it.

1q8se4n,"Ironically, I’m scared to make it to 1+ months sober. Any advice?","Hi all , currently on day 9 of sobriety. I’ve quit before in the past and it’s lasted at most for 3 months. I actually found that it was harder to resist the temptation the further away I got from my first day quitting, as the reminder of all the negative aspects weed had on my life blur into jumbled memories and the rose- tinted glasses come on.

Don’t get me wrong, the first couple of weeks are super tough, but because of the physical symptoms and less so the mental ones. I can endure the withdrawals because it reminds me how terribly addicted I was to grass, and it also acts as a mental deterrence. I’ll be lying in my sweat soaked bed shaking and hyperventilating, and think, “do I seriously want to do a drug again that makes me feel like this when I quit it?” And that sobers up my mind. 

But, once you get past the worst of the physical symptoms, it’s all about mental fortitude. And that’s when it becomes really hard for me to remember why I quit in the first place. Plus the depression and anxiety comes on ten fold and the flood gates open with all the traumatic shit I repressed with weed. 

So, I wanted to make this post now while I’m still in the early stages and ask for advice on how I can prepare for that. And to ask for advice from folks who have quit for a while, and how they managed to hold on and remember why they quit. (Plus perhaps some coping mechanisms or activities people enjoy doing to distract themselves when those addictive thoughts come up?) 

Ultimately, I just don’t want to forget and lose focus like I did in the past. I guess it’s not surprising I don’t have the best memory since I smoked weed for so many years .. lmao

When I was young I was bored easily but life was good. After two big traumas when I was young I started having night anxiety/panic attacks and when I didnt feel them I felt always empty and so easily bored it was pain. I tried weed when I was 19 years old and it was like finding back colors to my life...

After that I spent 3 years just enjoying series, movies and video games until I got back to my studies and got my master major of my promotion still while gerting high all the time. After having my master I was lost again and after a few years and another trauma, I was put on medication for depression and I decided to get a job. I did it and I was perfoming so good, people loved my work and me still while getting high all the time, I was followed by a psychiatrist who diagnosed me adhd at 32 years old which didnt suprise me but in my country adhd is barely recognized.

About 3 month ago I lost my main supplier and I had to find another which caused me to spiral and feel so anxious and bad I coudnt work anymore, it was hard to eat and all. I tried to change my medication for depression but it backfire hard but I found a new supplier and I was feeling like I could almost get back to my old self. 

Sunday last I took a very potent hash and I had my first and only bad trip I felt like weed made me so much worse than better like usual. Before that I could smoke and function, after that Im scared to even smoke. I tried a normal weed less potent but it still made me anxious like I was feeling back the bad trip.

Its now 4 days that I had to stop smoking both tobacco and weed and I cant leave/get out of bed, I cant eat I feel like everything is pointless and trying to do things that gave me joy before when I was high makes me feel pain from boredom and complete lack of meaning. Everything is ""whats the point ?"" I feel completly dead inside and its killing me, like really killijg me, I barely even drink, trying to watch something is physically painful because I jist remember how good it was on weed and how empty it feels now. I have a lot a suicidal thoughts.

I need help, or something, someone who shared a similar experience to give me hope, anything. In my country if I get hospitalised they will treat me as an addict and shoot me up instead of treating adhd so Im double scared because I cant see how Im going to survive without medical help and something to repoace the dopamine my brain seems to sorely lack...

1q8ne77,Day 4 of Quitting Weed,"Hello everyone,

I recently decided that it is time for me to stop smoking after almost 8 years of being high every day. I'm on day 4, and it's been going well so far! I have more energy to exercise, cook, and practice self-care, which I have been too lazy to do when high. I am looking for some advice on activities to do at the end of the day when I crave it the most. I need something to ""look forward to"" after a long day of school or internship. I have been reading and watching movies, but I want to get more ideas because I fear I will eventually lose interest in those activities. Any advice is helpful! ",1767999985.0,2,3,leaves,substance
1q8mngz,Help,"Hi there,

I'm 21, been smoking since I was 15 and heavily since 17. I know I did a lot of damage at that age. Especially because I was addicted to hard drugs and alcohol at the time too. 

Fast forward to about 2 and a half years ago and I was sectioned in hospital after blacking out on booze and pills. I've spent the time since in an unemployed stoned haze. Off the hard stuff but still drinking.  Weed absolutely made me comfortable in my misery, it was my best friend in a lot of unfortunate ways.

I know there are a lot of underlying issues here. Trauma, chronic pain and a lack of identity mostly. For the longest time I've known that weed was just an escape. However over the last four months I went through a terrible breakup that left me feeling replaced and betrayed. Our pet died, that I cared for, the same time they launched the new partner on the socials. My mother was in hopsital due to her own addiction issues and has since fallen heavily off the wagon. My sister had major surgery that she is still healing from and I have lost myself in a haze during this time period. 

My plan was to quit. Its what I know I needed for my health and future. I get extreme withdrawals including insomnia, sickness and my chronic pain flares up, to name a few. I had a thorough plan for January to very slowly taper off. I had bought scales and was going to weigh each bit slowly so I could reduce the extreme nastiness of the withdrawal and help feel like I'm not actually dying. Of course my luck that 2 days ago I started having heart palpitations that resulted in anxiety every time I try to smoke. It is now doing the opposite of what it helped me with. I have read into this and apparently after years of smoking it can totally just switch up on you. Now I don't have CHS or anything. It's all anxiety and potentially a sign of a weakened heart which would make sense after smoking 14g a week for god knows how long with minimal breaks. Maybe I've finally did myself in. 

I'm just going through a lot right now. And the idea of my main coping mechanism just being shut down and unavailable to me without the option to taper is a very scary idea to me. And as someone who has struggled with addiction to other substances in the past, this has always helped ground me away from those other things. Any advice or information about this would mean a lot to me. I'm sorry for the essay",1767998217.0,4,9,leaves,substance

The ass end of the year is always hardest for me, I have a lot of family issues, mental health stuff, and at the end of last October I decided I'd buy a small 300mg cart, just to quiet things for a bit.

I'm back on day 5 again of not smoking , it's not nearly as bad as last time and I feel myself improving but I'm disappointed in myself, I'm disappointed in how easily I fell back into it.

Spending the first week of the year alternating between hot and cold, chugging water all day because I'm sweating like crazy, having stomach issues, not sleeping, forcing myself to eat but hating every bite has...not been fun.

1q8hsep,I just realized I hit 1 year sober,"I downloaded an app to track my progress when i first stopped. At the time i was literally counting the seconds. I first smoked at 14, when a friends older brother introduced me to it. At 15 I gained access to endless amount. Long story short i smoked every single day from 15-24. Up until college it was fun and I was pretty careless. My friends and I would smoke and go out on adventures, I didn’t see the negative effects because I didn’t really foresee what the future would bring given I was still developing mentally. 

My parents caught me enough to the point they realized I would always find a way to get high and eventually they gave up. It was until covid and lockdown that I smoked enough in solitude to produce suicidal ideation and a genuine lack of care for my body and future. I woke up everyday and the first thing i would do is get high. Any time a hint of sobriety entered my mind it was time for a blinker. It went from bud to wax pens to dabs as I could never satisfy my cravings. Sometimes I would think about my life and how helpless I was to my addiction and would cry. I would sit there and think of how death would feel. 

I knew from talking to my friends that my relationship with weed was different and I had a much much harder time dealing with my substance abuse. I would quit for days and weeks but always come back. I finally built up the courage 1 year, 2 days, and 11 hours ago to quit. I didn’t hold an expectation of it lasting. The first month was literal hell. I enjoyed nothing. I barely ate or slept and couldn’t function. I saw a psychiatrist as I truly felt I would never be the same and I ruined my brain chemistry. Following the first month it got better but only incrementally. Somewhere around month 3 I really caught my stride and noticed I could go days without thinking about it. Near month 6 is when I felt some of my neural pathways might have reset and I was beginning to feel and function normally. 

Now at a year I am so eternally grateful that I made that decision a year ago. Life is great. I feel so deeply and through the courage to quit my willpower and self confidence has grown immensely. I now wake up everyday with a voracity for life and all it has to offer. I’m truly living in reality and not the cloud of smoke that numbed my every feeling. I am the only one of my friends to have quit and yes they can smoke around me and I feel no need or want to smoke. If anything to see how quickly time has passed gives me reason not to. Every day happy and sober is another day my mind and body strengthens. I can’t forget how truly hopeless I felt in the midst of it and the beginning of sobriety. 

To anyone else at the beginning or who is struggling and failing to quit, take it one step at a time. At the beginning, if i thought of myself today and how long a year is i wouldve never quit, but i made a decision that no matter how many times I failed I would hold strong and true to what i felt, to that this wasn’t the life I wanted to live. Now one year sober, I moved out of my hometown, have an apartment, a full time job, discipline and a newfound confidence in who i am, who i REALLY am. I’m realizing how long this is so I’ll end it with this: someday you’ll look back and be amazed how just sticking to something and just letting time do the rest will change your life. Love you guys.

I know I’ll get through this first week because I’ve done it before and I know for a fact I will feel much better after the first week or two. But in the past I’ve picked up a single joint after months of sobriety and ended right back where I started.

I have something different motivating me this time (I want things for my life in these next 5-10 years that I didn’t really care about before because I figured I could do those things later, well later is now I guess), which I hope will be enough for me to not pick up that first joint.

But I’m curious what motivates you all to stay sober as maybe we could all use some extra motivation.

For me, I want to find a job that’ll pay an okay living, a partner who deserves the best version of me, and maybe start a family with any luck.

In 2004, I hit the 9 month mark of quitting soda around the same time my roommate moved out. She was the plant mom (really _all_ the decorations in the apartment were hers), I was the bare walls brokey, so it was an emotional time.

I told myself ""one soda"" and it turned into a daily habit for the next seven years.

I get this feeling with milestones of, ""wow, this has become a really big thing,"" and if there is a day that I stray, it feels like I've broken the big thing and can no longer brag about being a year sober etc. The damage to the progress report hurts, you know?

1q85h5y,ADHD and Quitting,"Hi y’all. I am 37F and have been a heavy user for the past five years. I quit four days ago because…well…I have developed a horrible cough and my use was getting out of control. I have a good corporate job and get to work from home and over the past year have taken to smoking from 11 am (early in the workday) until I pass out at 10 pm. No one has even caught on that I am high at work but I live in terror that one day someone will realize and I’ll be fired. So I quit. There are other reasons but those are the main ones.

Like many others I am having trouble with appetite and sleep. Night sweats kicked in last night and whew they were a doozy. But I’m also feeling extremely manic and am not sure if this is normal or is a result of my ADHD hyperactivity blooming now that it isn’t suppressed by weed.

For a little background, I was diagnosed around thirty years ago and have always been high energy and kind of obnoxious. I can already tell that without the weed suppressing my personality I am louder, talk more, and am slightly more impulsive. I’m anxious that this will cause problems at work because I already have a forceful personality. 

I guess I’m just looking for perspective from others who are quitting…did you feel a ‘personality resurgence’ after quitting? Did it quiet down/level out after a few weeks?

I’m hitting 40 hours at the day job plus 20 hours on my personal projects. If I’m busy building, I don't have time to be high.Every morning starts with a workout. I’m scaling them up to 1 hour. If I don't burn that physical energy early, the insomnia wins.

This is the hardest part. I know from last time that the first week is a sweat-fest with zero rest, but I’m leaning on the morning workouts and a strict ""no-screens"" rule after 9:00 PM to force my brain to downshift naturally. I’m forcing myself out of the house. One solo fun activity and one social meet-up per week, planned a month in advance. No staying in and rotting.

I'm posting this for accountability. Exercise and a packed schedule are the only things that have ever worked for me. If I have a free hour, I’m at risk. If I’m working toward my goals, I’m safe.

Has anyone else found that ""over-scheduling"" is the only way to stay clean? How do you guys handle the wall of exhaustion in week one without reaching for the easy fix?",1767952487.0,1,0,leaves,substance

This involves a lot of travel so I really need to learn to be without it for atleast a few days without my head falling off.

So I’ve tried to swap out smoking for exercise, massively upped my gym and training schedule but oh god this week has been horrible. Without weed I cannot seem to sleep or eat enough. Every day I feel more lethargic and sad.

I have quit and gone back to smoking weed for the last three years now. The longest I've gone was about 11 months I think. The times I started smoking again were pretty typical shit. I only picked it back up two times, one time I told myself it was okay after passing a state board test(my reward I guess), and another time when my boyfriend was out of town and i justified it as ""it helps me sleep cause your not here"". 

So here I am once again 2 months sober, and I need some advice from anyone who can help! Do the craving ever stop?? When will I start to feel normal? I feel like even when I've quit for 11 months the cravings never end! I crave weed whenever I'm at home. Or I dunno maybe I crave the numbing my childhood trauma lol

1q8034p,Weed-induced binge eating,"31F. I’ve been smoking since I was 16. I’ve successfully taken month-long breaks from weed, but somehow it always finds its way back into my life.

One of the biggest issues for me is the weight gain from binge eating when I smoke. I know overeating is often joked about or normalized in the cannabis community, but for me it turns into a serious problem. It leaves me feeling unhealthy and guilty, and I know my gut doesn’t tolerate it well, which then affects my mental health too.

Most of my friends who smoke don’t really understand this. Many of them say weed actually suppresses their appetite (I wish). I’ve also noticed that when I smoke solo, I *completely* lose control with food. That realization has made me feel ready to be done for good.

I’m mostly posting this to speak it into existence and to lean on this community for encouragement. I’d also love to hear from anyone who’s had a similar experience.

1q801c4,Quitting is not a magic solution.,"You might have read the title and many of you probably felt annoyed or did not like what I said, but I want to share my thoughts and the conclusions I am coming to in my own head. I have two ideas that I cannot stop thinking about, and I really feel like they can help you. Today I want to focus only on the first one.

The first idea is this. Quitting smoking is not enough.

Let me explain what I mean by that. I see a lot of people here who quit smoking for months and then say I have been clean for five or six months, or four months, or three months, and my life has not improved. I am in the same place I was before. I do not feel much better. I actually feel worse, because at least when I was smoking I felt a little better about the situation I was in. So I want to go back to smoking.

Look, things do not work like that. Just because you stopped smoking does not mean that life now owes you happiness or that everything is supposed to magically get better. That is not how it works. You have to actively work toward the life you want to build. Yes, quitting smoking is huge. It is incredible. It is what we all want to do and it is one of the hardest parts. But quitting smoking is not a magic formula for success.

It has to come with a change in routine.

I know that many of us here, many former smokers or smokers in general, are very home oriented people. We like routine. We like comfort. We like staying inside our bubble, isolated, doing the same things every day. If you quit smoking but stay in the same bubble, with the same routine, the same loneliness, the same habits, you are not going to feel better. You will just be at home, or stuck in your head, thinking. That is not enough.

If you quit smoking, and I am sorry to say this, but it is the truth, that alone is not enough. You have to go out. You have to do things. You have to create new habits, find new hobbies, change how you spend your time, do things with your life that actually fulfill you. Because if all you do is quit smoking and expect everything else to stay the same, you are not going to feel better. Things will stay the same. I promise you that.

Change the conversation in your head, stop telling yourself things were better before, that’s bs, you are here for a reason and it’s because addiction was sucking a lot. I know for me it was, it was never enough, never enjoyed anything really, it was just me trying to fill my dopamine appetite. 

This are the things I’m thinking about and telling myself, maybe some of yall can relate!",1767937273.0,212,32,leaves,substance
1q7zq0r,Got dumped and used it as a starting point,"I (22f) have been a daily smoker for about 4 years now. It started as a way to help me relax and sleep, but lately it’s been all day everyday thing when I’m not at work. When I WFH it’s a constant habit unfortunately and definitely impacts my work. 

I’ve been wanting to quit for a a while now but never got the motivation until I was dumped 2 weeks ago (for very vague and cliche reasons seemingly unrelated to my smoking habits). I thought we had a great relationship, but the more I think about it, I realized a lot of my shortcomings were related to my consumption. I was numbing myself and effectively overlooking the issues in our relationship. It made me feel better when he was being distant, helping me convince myself nothing was wrong. It made me less likely to speak up for myself. It made me less attentive to my partner when I should’ve been. I relied on it to relax and get out of my own head during sex, something he never made me feel bad about but definitely impacted his decision to end things with me. 

It’s been 9 days since I last smoked on New Years Eve. I’ve been so depressed and devastated and unable to get out of bed, but the thought of smoking again makes me cringe. 
I don’t want to be the person who numbs themself into false stoicism. I don’t want to be the person I was during that relationship. 

Idk how long I’ll keep this up (I’m not trying to create any extra expectations for myself right now). I think part of me hopes that if I stop he’ll notice and want me back, but I think the relationship has run its course for good. 

Has anyone used a breakup to motivate their sobriety? How did it work out for you? Has a partner ever come back to you after quitting weed? Any advice?

1q7z1w0,Inspiration: Just Completed Day 9,"Hi, you may have seen some of my other posts from the last 9 days, but today I nearly felt like myself again. This is to give hope for those who think they’ve totally fucked themselves.

I did carts HARD for about 2 months. Near the end I had no appetite, sleep was getting shitty, and I had been thinking what I was doing was harmless and it would be easy to drop. I had previously quit back in August; at that point it was only at night and I quit without any withdrawal symptoms. In fact any time in my life I had quit pot I had never had any withdrawal symptoms.

But I relapsed in November when I got salmonella poisoning and needed something for the nausea. During that week I was using the pens all day, and before I knew it I was over the sickness and said I’ll keep this up til the holidays are over and drop it. Terrible idea. 

Those pen are incredibly addicting and boy oh boy are those physical withdrawal symptoms real. Not even mentioning the mental ones. I didn’t eat for nearly 48 hours outside of smoothies or ensure. Vomiting, nausea, lightheaded, emotional, sad, at times felt psychotic and if I’m being honest there were a few “this will never end” thoughts.

I took it day by day, knowing the next would be even only slightly better than the last. I had my first real bite of food on day 3. Emphasis on single bite. But it felt like winning a war. It progressed to me being back to a normal-ish appetite. Today was the first day with a full breakfast lunch and dinner. Lightheaded and dizziness all but gone. I am irritable and my anger has come back, but that’s manageable. Most frustrating has been the sleep in the past couple days, but that’s manageable will only improve too. 

I say this to give those who maybe had used similarly to how I did, for as long as I did, what my timeline looked like. I was scared I would be out of commission for weeks with a huge deadline at work, but I got better way faster than expected. Those first few days were very dark and bleak; I didn’t see a point to life or what I was putting myself through. Today I was listening to music and it was hitting just right and I started laughing and crying because I finally felt like me again, and I knew I was ok.

There have been a few cravings, mostly at night once the lady goes to bed, but I just keep telling myself “nah maybe tomorrow”, to just throw the craving a memory, JUST FOR TODAY. If you think about quitting forever you’re going to have a bad time. But I try to think “I want to feel like me for the rest of the day, we can try that other stuff again tomorrow if I still want to”. Rinse and repeat my friends.

One day, one hour, one minute at a time if you have to. 

This is coming from 13 years of sobriety from alcohol that I decided to stop applying to pot, foolishly. 

Recovery is possible. It’s simple, but not easy. If it was easy, everyone would do it.

1q7ylty,30 days. My experience.,"40M, smoked since 15 - daily unless quitting for a job or something. Smoked more and more over the last 10 years. Quit drinking 3+ years ago and leaned heavily on cannabis. “Tried” to stop several times, but deep down I didn’t want to - just felt like I should. This time I wanted to, and it has taken a year to work up the courage to do it. The really wanting to is probably the most important part. 

Zero cravings, because I needed to be done. I left state for a week and rented a cabin. Saw family for a couple hours each day. The rest of the time I tried to sleep a lot, drove around, read and watched shows.

My appetite wasn’t there and when I ate anything more than a couple/few hundred calories at a time, I felt terrible. Bone broth was a life saver - avoiding sugar was a life saver.

Day 3-4, the night sweats kicked in. They lasted almost 3 weeks. My sleep was not good - it’s important to sleep when you can and not expect to sleep through the night. That rarely happened. I still only sleep 4-5 hours, but have learned to eat a little snack (granola and berries with oat milk for me), then go back to sleep about 45 minutes later. Still nap whenever I can. 

The intense dreams kicked in around week 2. Things I have suppressed - a near drowning, unresolved issues with my father/other family members, past relationships, etc. I have since made amends with my father/ other family members. 

I resigned from a good paying job that was too stressful (very glad I did). I ended a relationship that I knew wouldn’t last and needed too much attention/energy. Quitting cannabis has been my #1 focus, #2 has been resolving the issues that the clarity of not smoking allowed me to see. 

I already ran/exercised a lot, but never sober. About 7 days in of no working out, I started doing very light workouts, steam room, hot tub, cold plunge -> all very helpful, but to be straightforward, there is no ‘cure’ or soft landing for quitting cannabis. 

I was extremely irritable - still have my moments - best addressed by eating healthy and very lightly. I’ve lost 8 lbs. was already very lean. 

I read spiritual literature like Eckhart Tolle’s work, Thic Naht Hahn’s work, Lao Tzu, etc. I started going to a slow paced yoga class with an emphasis on meditation and lots of breath work. I reconnected with some AA friends for community -> important. I’ve spent a lot more
Time with family. 

I watch a lot of stand up comedy. I’m back to exercising at about 70% of what I was doing before quitting. I could go 100%, but it still jacks with my nervous system and makes it harder to sleep -> getting easier and making progress. 

I saw my doc because my blood pressure was going up as I was running on adrenaline/cortisol. Had never had high BP before. Pretty much back to normal and often low. 

Some good stuff now:

I feel so fucking proud of myself. I haven’t had to use nasal spray once. Dreaming is awesome - I had totally forgotten what dreaming was like (and how important it is). I breathe so easily. I drive without worry. I never smell like weed or wonder if people can tell. I do what I want and don’t think about how I’m going to get weed, when I’m going to smoke it, do I have enough, etc. I’m extremely present. I have so much energy. I have so much motivation. I’ve been doing lots of stuff that I had been putting off. My place is clean and organized. My vehicle is
clean and smells good. I value myself. I’m comfortable being alone without weed. There’s so much I have gained in 30 days.

I have read many times that people were having a hard time staying committed and not feeling good at this point; so, I did as much as I could to get healthy habits rolling and it has helped tremendously. I still have bad days - or, rather, I have bad hours/ waves of difficulty. I have to be very careful with my caffeine intake or it can make it feel like day 3-4 again. 

I’m super pumped about this. I’ve given enough of my life to it. The most important thing was I really, honestly, wanted to stop for myself. No one asked me to. I had made a quitting date and it didn’t work, I smoked right through it. A couple of weeks later, I took that trip and got away from it. I’ve not had one craving - I have felt like hell a lot, no lie, and I don’t believe there is a way around that for someone like me, but sometimes the only way to get over something is to go through it. I’m mostly through, and realizing new benefits almost everyday. 

The only lingering issues is fragmented sleep, waves of anxiety/sadness that DO pass and I remind myself of that when they are happening, and the rest of my unaddressed/suppressed emotions that I’m working through. 

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. If you are thinking about quitting, just do it. There isn’t a perfect time. There isn’t a perfect situation. Embrace the suck and do it. ",1767932939.0,136,19,leaves,substance

1q7y1k9,Relapsed After 2.5 years clean.,"Thank GOD I didn’t pick up a drink because that’s my DOC and brought me to my knees. But I’ve been smoking pot for about a month and I’m really disappointed in myself. I keep buying pens and throwing them out, but by the end of the day, I always find myself picking another one up. The fact there is no smell and I can do it indoors means that once work is over, it is glued to my hand until I go to bed.

I went into AA knowing I was powerless over alcohol, but had reservations if I was truly powerless over weed. I now have none. A month ago, I found myself hitting my pen on my lunch break. For context, I literally just started a new job in November.

I talked to my therapist and some sober supports about it. Its true when they say staying sober is easier than getting sober. I wish I would have just rode out that discomfort I was feeling instead of grabbing a pen. I know how to get sober. I did it 2.5 years ago when drinking blew my life up.

Headache. Increased irritability. Racing thoughts. These were my main downfalls today that my brain told me I should smoke. But I didn't and it was simply because it was getting way too damn expensive. Living in NYC - recreational weed at almost every smoke shop you find (the right ones) and it's been blowing my bank to crumbs. 

I've told myself for years I'd quit and it was always the same story of ""I'll do it on NY for the resolution"" or ""ill smoke for my birthday and stop after"" and never did. I started smoking in 2020 when my ex wanted to started smoking weed and I joined in and since then haven't stopped. I go through an ounce a month, could be more if I wanted to but that's me making it stretch. 

Prior to 2020, I rarely smoked and the last time I smoked to the point where I was purchasing from my dealer every day (dimes), was 2013. But quitting was much easier then. I would start smoking Newport to get that same deprived-of-oxygen to the brain feeling but I'd eventually stop both altogether and until 2020 never touched weed or cigarettes ever again.

With this quitting attempt, I am finding I get very hard on myself. I am critical about every thing I do, if I make a tiny mistake that annoys someone I will burst into tears. I feel guilty and ashamed for having an addiction, guilty for wanting to smoke so badly, guilty for how I have damaged myself with weed. I am ashamed of myself and I truly honestly hate myself at the moment.

Today, I got so upset and tired of being in my head that I started to hit my head on the cupboard, the doorframe, wall, broom, my hands. I have a headache and a small goose egg, Im feeling a little better, less intense, but now I feel guilty and ashamed that I did that as I have been clean from self harm (excluding weed) for several years. I just threw that all away because I am trying to quit weed... I am just so.... what if i cant do this? What if I consistently fail?

1q7tkmc,It never goes away,"But it gets quieter. To the point you can only hear it when you listen carefully. 

Most of my teen years, all of my 20s. More than 4 years off it now. But I'm still addicted. It was my friend, my enemy, my comforter, my pacifier. 

Life is fucking hard. Weed makes it easy, for now. But I know that is false. Weed makes it *feel* easy while I languish in inaction, mediocrity. While others get up early and go for runs I was sleeping in, wasting the best years of my life because I had been up all night wasting the best years of my life wasting time. 

And no more. Now my life is full. I am so aware of my life. I love it. I have a full life, great friends, fulfilling hobbies and an incredible family. My wife and kids are everything to me now.

But it's still there, just a bit ""Hey why don't you go visit your old friend who still smokes, that could be fun, you don't even have to smoke"". It lasts a moment, and I tell that thought to ""feck off!"" and it does, because there are better alternatives. 

But mostly, I've built a far better life than where I was and I feel so thankful I quit just before my 30th birthday. 

I tried to moderate, disaster. I tried to quit alone, failure after failure. What made it stick was making quitting about something bigger than quitting. 

I quit for my family, I quit to be the best at my job to provide for them. I quit to be the best at being there for them. And that has made every temptation a tiny little voice that I can, with great derision, ignore.

1q7suvw,Quitting Nic and Weed after 2+ years of lies to my wife,"I've been lying to my wife for almost 2+ years now, smoking and consuming edibles in the basement and at work whenever I could, and she finally caught me. Some part of me knew it was inevitable but I continued to do it anyways. Before we were married over 5 years ago now, I was previously addicted to weed, although much more so than recently, and it got to the point of panic attacks that forced me to come clean at work (and thankfully they supported me during my recovery). I had to do piss tests for over a year, and got involved in NA and stayed clean for quite some time. But then I stopped going to meetings and several years later eventually fell off the wagon, convinced that I could just do it recreationally. Unfortunately that was not the case and i was doing it much more frequently. My wife knew about my past addiction, and she had no reason to think that I would pick up again. Since I was so ashamed that I was using again, I never told her and chose to lie and hide it from her, which I was successful at for over 2 years. Then she found out and it was horrible, such a betrayal of trust that I'm not sure she'll ever be able to fully forgive me for. 

Its so strange how even though i've been clean for 5 days now, my brain is still paying tricks on me. Unlike many (I assume) I was able to maintain a high level of performance even though I was high much of the time. I got several promotions at work, maintained friendships, cared for my wife to a high degree, didn't let anything slide. We got pregnant in those two years, and just recently had our first son, and even though I was getting high in my down time, I was still meeting and exceeding at all my responsibilities. I thought I had the winning formula. Turns out lying about getting high and vaping is a huge betrayal, and has now seemed to ruin everything. I am grateful that my wife has not left me, and seems to be willing to work through this with me, but its killing me that my addict brain is still trying to find ways to get back into the habit in the future. One moment I'm telling myself I don't identify as a smoker or user anymore, and im sincere, and then almost immediately I can hear the addict in the back of my brain saying ""don't worry, I'm patient, as soon as there is a change i'll jump at it"" and that REALLY scares me. 

  
In general, being clean and not vaping has sucked. I find that the joy has been robbed of my day - I no longer look forward to waking up, and to what the day holds. I feel joy when I hold my son, and see him smile, or when I connect with my wife, or have that first cup of coffee in the day, but outside of that everything feels grey dull and boring and I can't stand it. I've signed up for some recovery services at my church and hopefully that will help, but I'm really wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience, and when I might start to find joy in life again cause right now its just hard. If it wasn't for my wife locking out any access to finances, and making sure she can see my location at all times, i'm convinced I would have started using again and its killing me.",1767917636.0,5,2,leaves,substance

1q7qq2w,"I'm on day 12 of not smoking, I don't feel any different, but I'll keep going.","12 days ago, I got sick with a cold and decided to take a break. Once I felt better, I realized I wanted to quit for good, I was already a week in anyway. For context, I’ve smoked hash every day for over 10 years. I usually only smoked one joint before bed, after finishing work or my responsibilities. Occasionally, I would smoke a joint in the middle of the day, but I always felt like shit after that.

I wasn’t a stereotypical lazy stoner or using it as an escape, in matter of fact, I think it made me more anxious. I started out of boredom because I had nothing to do after I finished work, and enjoyed it, so I kept doing it for over 10 years, every single day.

Regardless of what anyone says, this stuff is addictive. I used to lie to myself and say it wasn’t, but it is. I’m on day 12 and still think about it. I didn’t quit because of money or because it was ruining my life—I quit because I hated being dependent on it. I run my own business, and if anything, it sometimes helped me stay productive after work. I would spark one up after I finish work, and it somehow gave me the motivation to keep working, and I really enjoyed working while I was high, that's something I will truly miss.

I haven’t told my family or friends yet because I’m afraid of relapsing and disappointing them, so I’m posting here to hold myself accountable.

The first few days were rough, especially with sleep, but after about a week it got easier. I still think about lighting up before bed and hope that fades with time. I haven’t noticed major changes yet, maybe I feel a bit less foggy. My energy feels somewhat low, but I’m not irritable, and I haven’t had the vivid dreams people talk about. Maybe that’s because I smoked hash instead of weed—I'm not sure. Either way, I’m excited to keep going and leave this habit behind.

Day 3 was probably the worst day. I was at school for 9 hours again, and i just didn’t want to leave. it was scary. i’m terrified of being at my house now, especially alone. my room is nothing but memories of depression and weed, weed and depression. i walked a few miles to try and tire myself out but i still only got maybe 3 hours of anxiety ridden sleep. appetite was terrible, but i remember the night of day 3 i did eat most of a small can of ravioli, which was my first food in days. i almost threw it up and it took about an hour to eat those probably 200 calories but it was the first win of this journey. 

Day 4 i woke up feeling super sick. I had been hyperventilating from the panic attacks, and when i went to the doctor later i found out i had a bad fungal infection in my throat, caused by dry mouth. fever all day, couldn’t talk, swollen face and neck. this day sucked too. i cried probably 20 times throughout the day. this was the most emotional day so far. i’m grateful to have some advisors at my school who i trust and have been telling them how much i’ve been struggling (obviously didn’t mention the weed just anxiety). i guess they have all discussed my state and have been reaching out separately to offer support. it feels good to have support but it makes me feel so damn guilty that all of this is happening because of this stupid plant. i’m surrounded by so many successful people who would think what i’m going through is the dumbest thing in the world. it feels like they’re empathy is being wasted on a stupid pothead like me. this more than my physical symptoms has been the hardest hurdle to overcome. i’m just so ashamed of myself for working so hard to get into med school, so hard to QUIT WEED FOR MONTHS to get into med school, just to be wasting this opportunity. Biggest positives from day 4 was that i was able to choke down like 8 chicken nuggets before bed, and i think it helped me sleep a little better. sleep improved from 3 hours to 5 hours. 

today is day 5 and it’s mostly bad with a little good. i woke up feeling terrible again, just horribly anxious. i got stuck in traffic and was almost late for school which had me freaking out, but then the first few hours of school went by fine. i did have bad diarrhea today, i guess from eating for the first time in days + stress. i had an emotional moment in the middle of the day when one of my favorite professors asked to talk to me privately. she said she had heard about my anxiety and wanted to help however she could. started crying right there and im sure they all think im a basket case now (they’re right). again, it feels good to be supported but its really hard right now to feel like i deserve it. i was able to eat a little lunch today which was a really big win. even when i was smoking i coukdnt eat lunch. when im not withdrawing from weed, i can eat 3 meals a day. but even when im smoking i can only get my appetite up late late at night when i can chain rip my bong. so it feels good to not just eat a little something, but eat it during my lunch break. you know, like a normal person. i’m going to try and go for another walk, and then study for my giant test next week. hopefully i can chill out enough to get some more sleep. i’ll update again tomorrow.

1q7iqy9,That “motivation rush” dies down after like 6 months and your body starts to crave smoking again. badly.,"People always talk about how hard it is the first month but I think it’s important to realize that it doesn’t just end there. After you overcome one of the ‘hardest stage’ of quitting, we all like to think that everything else that’ll come after that would be easy. The truth is, yeah it does get much easier after the first month or two but after a while, your brain & body starts to test you all over again because the cravings never actually went away- it was just briefly & temporarily suppressed. 

When life starts to get stressful again & when your world starts to feel like it’s crumbling down, the first thing you want to turn to is smoking. Someone else mentioned it here but it’s basically like a reaction reflex. It’s been 7+ months since i quit smoking but the moment some stressful ass shit started piling up in my life, my ass drove to the dispensary without hesitation. I picked up some edibles and came back home but didn’t actually have the balls to do it. I guess deep down I knew it wasn’t the right thing to do. 

That was yesterday. Today I’m just laying in my bed thinking about the edibles that’s sitting in my closet & deciding what the fuck to do about it. I dont have the balls to actually take it but I also dont have the balls to throw it away either.

Cold turkey is the only way for me and I've come to accept that. I have tried many times over the years to ""just smoke once in the evening only"" or ""every few days"" or whatever.  I fail every time. 

For reference, I've smoked bong and joints for the most part... all day, every day. Averaging a gram a day. Around 2018-2021 I also heavily incorporated concentrates, carts, and edibles. (So glad i stopped carts a few years back because I've heard withdraw from them is WAY worse and I am already struggling!)


Days 1-3 : Exhausted and irritable, constant evening cravings, random bouts of headaches and nausea. 4 hours of sleep max the first few nights.  Restlessness like never before. 

Days 4-7 : High anxiety and a huge flood of emotions. I feel scattered, I feel angry, I feel giddy... basically everything at once. Sleep has become a bit easier except now I have nightmares! Had a dream I smoked last night and was so relieved when I woke up and realised I hadn't.

1q7c4xz,12 years it’s time to go,"Ahhh, the classic my girlfriend dumped me and now I I’m gonna post about quitting weed post.

Let me give you a quick bio 
I’m a 27-year-old male who graduated from university last year. I was on an athletic scholarship to university and competed all the years I was there. I started smoking when I was 15 and I’ve been daily since I was 16. Weed just caused me a lot of problems in my life, relationships, family, sport. But I loved getting high wow did I love it. I would wake up and smoke before 6 AM practices, i’d smoke before fucking anything. Of course I can make the excuse that you know I was able to smoke and I passed school and was successful in athletics and yes, I’ve had plenty of girlfriends. But the whole time when I smoke, I always have these feelings in the back of my mind where it’s a Ying and yang fight of fuck I love this feeling and fuck I know this is not what I should be doing. I’ve now slipped myself into just a fucking dopamine addict, constant bong rips, nicotine vapes, scrolling Instagram endlessly, etc. 
 
It’s the most depressing fucking cycle. You could imagine looking from the outside in, but I’m inside right now and the weed has made me feel good and made me avoid looking at myself externally.

I just had the girl I wanted to marry dump me. She had no idea I smoked weed. I was so good at being able to hide it. I knew this girl was the one from the moment I met her. I lied to her and told her that I had quit weed years ago because I knew she did not like it. And I really told myself I was gonna quit. I slowed down. I set my date. And then I just kind of got comfortable and everything moved on I was madly in love in my own head. But externally, I was just chasing dopamine through weed, nicotine and my phone. Often the night I’d avoid hanging with her due to the urge to get high, which at this moment, looking back is ridiculous and I’m sure I’ll go my whole life regretting doing shit like that. She officially dumped me because I was distant, I didn’t show her the appreciation She actually really truly deserved. I truly am a fucking asshole for lying to her but maybe this is just the opportunity I need to actually do what I’ve wanted to do for years instead of staying comfortable. It’s time to push myself to be even more uncomfortable than I am right now. I’m so fucking scared. I mentally feel like death right now, but


I never wanna fucking feel like this again. Control needs to be taken. This is for me. I know this may be rambling or what not and I really just don’t even have the energy to type and I’m just talk to texting. But I just don’t really have anybody to talk to about this. I grew up in a family where weed is a complete no no. 

Anybody else go through somewhat of a similar situation?

I’m just crying on the couch the last few days, or if you knew me, you know that’s not me. I think this is my rock bottom it’s different for everyone. Mine may not be as extreme as others but mentally I feel broken, shattered, and I so desperately want to pick these pieces back up and glue them together

1q7bflj,A Year and 9 Months Sober,"A year and 9 months sober after 13 years of daily smoking,  and it's the best decision I've ever made. Everyone's experience is different, but this was mine in a condensed version:

The early months are taxing and will make you realize how addicting weed really is.   

The 3-12 month mark you start to slowly improve,  but will question if you've done permanent damage.   

1 year+ you start looking back at all the improvements in your life that occurred slowly over time - it is not a switch that flips.  You've done years of damage and it takes time to heal. 

With that said,  quitting weed is not a cure-all. It just removes the blinders that allows you to start improving life.  Work out,  learn something new,  take your vitamins/work on nutrition (vitamin D has been uplifting after I realized I always get depressed in the winter), and go to doctors appointments. 

You've come to this subreddit for a reason - quitting is so worth it.

Relationships
Sleep quality

I mostly smoked pens lately (3 years, 1G live resin) however to relate to a lot of you I’ve been smoking pot for ever 16 years every week. 

I’m 33(M)

After a week: 

I feel absolutely fucking incredible. My moods stabilized, my relationships are slowly getting better again, I can go out in public without thinking people are judging every step I make. 

I can hold conversations again and my self esteem is through the roof ! I stare people right in the eyes when I talk now haha I think sometimes it throws people off 😂 because so many others have anxiety we don’t know about. 

My sleep is almost coming back, if your quitting pens your gonna be off for about a week. Expect 1-4 hours if your lucky. 

ANXIETY is GONEEEEE BABY. I can’t tell you how happy I am just for this part. I never had anxiety, ever. I was smoking the pens and have had severe anxiety the last couple years, and I’d smoke the pens to stop the anxiety, yet they were the cause. A toxic rinse and repeat affect. It was horrible.

No more suicidal thoughts ( I never was but the pens made me feel as if I was) 

No more being scared of public situations, 

Job is improving. Everything is improving. Life is fucking beautiful lately. 

YOU GOT THIS PEOPLE. We’re so strong and we don’t even realize it. Don’t let pot ruin your ambitions, and I’m telling you for some can do it, but for the most part it destroys your ambitions. 

You have to find your “why” that also helped. I’ve got a 3 year old, and my ambition to work In the emergency services (FIRE), and being a better and present father and husband were my reasons…. And every time I felt depressed during this I went back to my “why’s”

From ""rocky and soap"" in 1990, seen it all and pigged right out on it all from sticks and seeds will break your bones to getting 24% the JH delivered on script and 99% living rosins... anyways 

My clinic is so slow over Christmas, by December 1st i only had my 10g and I stashed it for Christmas.  

I went through my avb in cookies and vape reclaim. Then I was out, I was surprisingly ok, Christmas came, by lunchtime boxing day I was out accept a bit for night.

So from boxing day to today ive been sober firttime in 30 yrs, wow, no withdrawals?? Im in a cut phase in the gym and im thinking that maybe burning my fats is staving off the pangs?? 

So today i have a full script turn up,, buds and oil turn up, and you know im like meh? Really whats the point?? Last year I'd have left work early to get on it but now I think im going to throw it in the freezer and see what happens. 

Have I just naturally come to the end of the roach as it where and thats it?

I fought tobacco for about 20 yrs trying and failed to pack it in and when I did eventually beat that demon, i was lucky that I found myself in a remote cabin for 12 months and the first 8 was so tough, even after 3 yrs I was still hanging for a ciggy. 8 yrs clean and im no more bothered.

But no weed, im sleeping much better if a lot less atm, no craving and I'm just meh about it.... so I think I'm going leave it out for a while and freeze my flower until such time i find myself in need or want.

Idk but I do know the extra 6 to 8k tax free pa saved on scripts will be handy too Ive not told anyone yet my OH noticed lastnight (bit worrying.. tbh) she was like, why you not vaping? I mean I woke and baked continued on full throttle for the past 8+ yrs

1q77b4o,Withdrawals make me not trust my own thoughts,"Brand new account because I would be lying if I said I wasn't ashamed of all of this.

I (20f) smoked my ceremonial last joint last Monday at midnight with my best friend. I've been smoking weed since I was 16, always as a mix of recreational and cope use. I went from an occasional joint a week for fun to 4-7 grams a day thanks to depression and my inability to ask for help.

I'm in a mental day clinic now since yesterday, and my friend that smokes every single joint with me for the past year is helping me with my withdrawals.

I already lost one of my childhood friends to heavier drugs as he transitioned from being a stoner to being a cokehead that takes whatever he's been offered about two years ago. Because of that I've been implementing regular 1-2 week breaks into my consumption, and I've never had craving during those, making me think that I want addicted. The past 4 months were just especially difficult for me mentally and my excessive habit turned into day after day abuse.

Now, I don't have the craving to smoke weed. I don't want to at all. I'm dealing with all the other symptoms of quitting like the god forsaken morning vomiting, headaches, super short temper etc. but the fact that I'm not craving weed itself makes me think I wasn't addicted, just dependant. But that thought itself is already making me worry that I AM addicted and just trying to tell myself things.

I keep hoping that one day, maybe in 1-2 years I'll be able to return to careful recreational use, but after discovering this sub today and reading other experiences, I'm guessing that I should probably let that thought go. Even if I have fond memories of back when I didn't make it a problem yet, where I smoked one joint for the evening and had a great time with my friends. I really want that feeling back... Not the weed per-se, but the fun times I had with it and my friends.

I was not an all day smoker, its just been right before I go to sleep every night, and despite the anxiety it induced I still kept going back to it. 

One big thing about this is I am not even supposed to be smoking weed because of the contraindications with a medication I'm on, due to risk of seizure. I've known this, and only got on the medication when I had stopped, but then when I started back up again I didn't want to stop either one of those things. 

I feel so attached to it, and I don't know why. It has been a big part of my life for so long, and giving it up feels like a major resistance even though I haven't even been enjoying it lately.

​Seven months ago, I reached out to this community to share my concerns about how marijuana was affecting my physical and mental health. Today, I am proud to share that after a period of deep self-reflection and hard work, I have successfully quit. My last day of use was Halloween, and to be honest, I haven't looked back. I finally feel like myself again.

​The transition wasn't easy. I experienced about two weeks of intense withdrawal—irritability, anger, and a complete loss of appetite, and inability to sleep. However, pushing through that initial phase was the best decision I’ve ever made.​ I’m the healthiest I’ve been in a very long time. While I know my body is still healing, the improvements have been incredible. I’ve rediscovered the joy of dreaming, my sleep quality has skyrocketed, and the chronic anxiety and paranoia have went away. Beyond the mental clarity and the end of 'brain fog,' I’ve even hit my fitness goals and reached my target weight. I am more present at work and in my personal life than ever before. 

I recognize I am in the early stages of recovery and I have to keep a positive mindset, as this struggle is something I know I will most likely always have to manage in some capacity. ​For those of you currently in the thick of it: please know that recovery is possible. I hope my story offers a bit of light for anyone struggling today. I am rooting for every one of you. You can and will get through this. ",1767849167.0,14,2,leaves,substance

I’m starting to feel better, I had some nausea over the past weekend that hasn’t been bothering me as much the last few days, and I am starting to feel myself getting hungry on my own. I managed to go out skating with some friends over the weekend (Saturday was fine, but Sunday the nausea made me need to take several breaks through the trail) and I’m generally feeling more clear. 

I’d say at this point my biggest hurdle is still the insomnia. After over 10 years of heavy smoking, I really can’t be too surprised. I’m honestly more surprised that the other things are coming back so much easier. I’ve definitely had a good amount of cravings, but that’s exactly why I got rid of everything so it’s not even an option on the table. 

Kudos to everyone here for your journey to clear headedness, and to everyone like me that started on Jan 1, WE GOT THIS!! ",1767849058.0,35,6,leaves,substance

1q72eoq,Quitting but worried about social life,"I'm 20F and I've been smoking since I was 16ish? It was pretty infrequently (only when offered by someone else at a party or something) until last year when I moved in with a friend who smokes every day. I never got to smoking every day but definitely a few times a week. Now I have become worried about the potential cognitive impacts it could have on me, especially given my brain still developing and my mental health issues (depression and anxiety). 

So I made the decision after NYE to stop and I haven't smoked since. I am worried, however, about how this will impact my social life. Many of my friends smoke weed, including my roommate at school. I'm at home right now and a lot of friends are getting together later this week to smoke together and I don't think I will be going. I thought at first it would be fine to go and just not smoke, but that might put me in a tough spot. I will either feel tempted by the weed or just left out/bored while they are all high and I'm sober. I also don't want to drink instead because I don't want to replace a substance with a substance. 

I'm also worried about the temptation aspect when I get back to school and live with someone who smokes so much and who I used to smoke with a lot (she even seemed sad when I told her was done and now I feel bad). 

I'm just not sure what my social life will look like moving forward. I will turn 21 in about a month so I can go to bars and drink, but I'm not even super into that. I preferred smoking but I really have to think about my cognitive and mental health.

6) The jitters. Idk if this is one but I feel so on edge and tense 😬 

These are the worst of them… I have been smoking for 5years, the last two especially (I would smoke a gram a day, at least). So I guess I should expect the worst of the symptoms.

I smoked consistently for about 8 years. I never felt super addicted because I would take breaks every now and then, and didn’t felt like it really affected my everyday focus and joy. Although, there were some periods where I relied on it much too heavily. I got in a car accident while high (thank god it was minor and no one was hurt) and vowed to never drink high again. 

But, I kept smoking because I’m young and because it was an escape every evening. Then, 4 months ago my mom was diagnosed with cancer. Mentally, I went to a dark place. Here I am, taking my health for granted. I know the opinions are mixed on how bad weed is for your lungs, but I think we can all agree not smoking is always better.

Which obviously could’ve been a lie but I’ve read some experiences on here that some people actually do go that frequently. 

This kind of eased my mind a bit to think “well at least my situation isn’t that bad.”

I’ve recently gotten into a habit of gambling occasionally, one of the apps shows you the amounts of money other people are putting in & people can post messages. 

On a recent loss someone posted about “I saw a guy put $1000 on that team, they must be crashing out rn”

I only lost $30 so seeing that made me feel like “ok at least I’m not in that deep” but it immediately reminded me of that same experience at the dispensary where I mistakenly minimized the negatives of my habit by comparing it to another who might be in deeper than me. 

Just felt like that was worth sharing, could be helpful to someone still in the habit of smoking regularly. Definitely going to take caution with the gambling, but wanted to highlight the way a mind can find ways to make excuses for itself. ",1767836624.0,38,8,leaves,substance

Day 21 of going cold turkey after being a daily smoker for around 20 years with very little breaks.

First week was fine, just the boredom kicking in and struggling to eat but tried to keep myself busy as had a trip for the holidays planned. Was part of the reason for wanting to quit and wanted to do so a week or so before I left. Not sure I timed that right.

Week 2, the night sweats kicked in but was sleeping okay otherwise and being away helped me stay busy and distracted. Hunger also started getting better. Diarrhoea was come and go mind.

Week 3, night sweats have stopped, feel my hunger is back to normal but the headaches and vivid dreams 😣 5 nights in a row now I have had the most random vivid dreams, not out right nightmares but not particularly happy dreams. Pending on the dream waking up rather emotional. But it was the waking up all groggy with headaches which is the worst, I've learnt to handle them more or less, more of a dull ache kind. Worse first thing, tend to ease off during the day and spike back up again in the evening.

I was away this time last year visiting family and was without for about 5 weeks. Recall the same headaches when waking then but just assumed I had the flu or some bug. What an eye opener and has really affirmed my wanting to quit!!

I wanted to share because sobriety is so much doom and gloom and climbing impossible mountains and grieving etc. But nah there's also this return to joy that you cannot describe. I am almost a bit overwhelmed by it and I'm actually realising now that one of the reasons I smoked so much is because I am hella avoidant to joy.

1q6szav,6 Months. Replace the Habit.,"It has been 6 months without a single gummy, which was previously my nightly “healthy alternative” to smoking THC. The difference this time is that I did not just quit, but I quit and built a healthy foundation of positive daily habits that ground my daily decision making in mental and physical wellbeing as the utmost priorities in my life instead. The main ones are simple, daily morning routines like 30 minutes of writing, 60 minutes of exercise and 20 minutes of showering/grooming to set myself up effectively for each day. I continue to stay sober because I know the amount of progress I have made in 6 months mentally and physically will be completely undone if I “just one night” weed ever again. At the age of 38, I have tested this theory countless times before and know that I am not a “just one night” person when it comes to weed and I never will be.

I have tried to stay sober for long periods, countless times before and always ended up in the same, habitually addicted spot of needing to quit cold turkey again after momentary relapses that would inevitably turn into months of habitual use. The key to sobriety is to quit and replace the addiction with habits that actively serve your mind and body, which is the exact opposite of what habitual, recreational weed use does. Once you see how much more capable you become in every aspect of life, you will realize how difficult it eventually becomes to erode your mental and physical strength with a mind-altering substance like weed. Set goals for yourself in the gym, on the weight scale, at school and in your career and build a daily routine that slowly but surely builds towards those same goals over time. If you do not set goals that are realistic and require daily execution to build towards achieving them, you are bound to repeat the cycle of habitually using this crap because nothing else in life matters to you enough to stay sober.

Weed is that friend that wants you to relive the old days and not think about the present or future. Sobriety is choosing to grow and develop in the opposite direction instead. The cravings now come less often and when they do I am able to quiet them much quicker because of the long term vision I now prioritize in maintaining my mental and physical strength through positive daily habits to achieve my long term goals. Happy 6 months to me. Happy day 1, 100 or 365+ to you, if you need it, but I assure you that sticking with a daily routine like you have stuck with the addiction is what will set you free.

I’ve been a long time cannabis user, started at probably 16 or 17 and I am 29 now. I’m having severe health issues (most non related, but some possibly related?) and looking to stop. I used to smoke but switched to edibles about two years ago and take 2 or 3 10 mg gummies every night. At one point I was taking 5 or 6.  What is the safest way to do this? Probably slowly as possible, as I’m sensitive to medicines and scared to make changes.  Unless it’s better to stop all at once.

1q6qs91,Day 2,"Day one was hard, but day two is harder. I’m currently sitting with the physical ""bill"" of a ten-year habit: the cold sweats, the constant nausea, the total lack of appetite, and the inability to focus or sleep. But I'm writing this to remind myself why I’m here and why I'm not going to give up on myself.

I’ve been a daily smoker for a decade. In my teens, it was social; it was about community and being with my peers. But in my twenties, the function shifted. I was working a really stressful job where I often had to hold emotional space for community members experiencing hardship, violence, and trauma. I worked anywhere between 50 and 80 hours a week, depending on what was happening. I started smoking after work to ""de-stress,"" but was soon smoking whenever I wasn't working.

For the last five or six years, I was smoking from the moment I woke up until the moment I went to sleep. It wasn't just ""after work"" anymore; it became my way of avoiding stressors. It became my way to mentally check out, and eventually, I was checked out almost all the time. Because I was still able to function, I just kept it going.

In the last three years, I was diagnosed with Autism and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Looking back, I see now that I was self-medicating mental health issues I wasn't ready to face. I kept telling myself I could manage it that I could just ""smoke socially"" and keep it under control. But I’ve learned that for me, there is no ""middle ground."" Every time I tried to be a social smoker, the cravings would follow me home, and within days, I’d be back in my room, smoking by myself all day long.

I don't have any ill feelings towards cannabis, and I recognize that weed did help me get through some tough times. However, I started asking myself what weed has taken away from me. Here are some of those reflections:

* I can't remember the last time I’d spent 24 hours sober or was fully present for myself or my loved ones.
* I never feel well-rested, no matter how much weed-induced sleep I get.
* I can't remember the last time I had a dream.
* I have a constant cough from all the smoking.
* I can't maintain motivation.
* My anxiety would get worse from smoking, but I would just smoke more and tell myself that the weed was helping.
* I don't have an understanding of my ""baseline,"" so any of the treatments I pursued for my MDD were being influenced by my smoking.

At the end of December, something shifted. I found a new wave of motivation and I decided to act on it while I still felt it. I threw out all my paraphernalia and committed. I'm trying not to negotiate with myself—or rather, my addiction. I'm trying not to isolate myself, and I’m finding support. I’ve been looking into marijuana-anonymous.org. This isn't my first time trying to quit, but I hope it'll be my last.

Honestly, weed has never had any huge, life-ruining consequences for me. I’ve been a heavy smoker since I was 16. Being a stoner became my whole identity. I like smoking. I like being high. And whenever I meet another smoker, I just know we’re gonna vibe.

Weed makes me a patient, fun, chill parent. It keeps my hyperactivity under control, which honestly makes me way more bearable for my coworkers and the people close to me. I don’t even have money issues because of it. Truly, my only real problem (besides the cough) is the addiction itself.

When I don’t smoke, I can’t eat, can’t sleep, can’t regulate my emotions, and can’t think straight. It’s insanely disabling. Everything takes so much planning, and I’m always in withdrawal because I always underestimate how much I’m gonna smoke. I turn down plans all the time because I didn’t bring weed with me. I get panic attacks if I feel any strong emotion and don’t have access to weed, etc.

I don’t know who I am sober anymore, but I know I can’t keep living like this. I’m on day 6 without smoking right now. I feel like absolute shit, and I really hope this is the last time I ever have to go through this. I’m scared.",1767815523.0,48,20,leaves,substance

I want to start woodworking but my habitual use of THC is the reason I haven’t started, worried I might cut a finger off or something worse. I’m on my seventh day of abstinence and I’m having trouble with everything. I haven’t been sleeping, my stomach is a mess and I feel so weak. I just messaged a group of friends to cancel on tonight’s get together because I feel so bad. It’s noon now and by this time of day I would just be getting back from the gym from a very intense workout and would be eating a balanced lunch. Not today. Today I have been doing nothing but sitting here feeling bad and doom scrolling. 

My habit of using started a few years ago when I retired. The first thing in the morning I got high and stayed that way the entire day until bedtime, like an addiction, it got a stranglehold on my life. What caused me to quit started two summers ago with a feeling in my heart while riding my road bike that it wasn’t getting enough air, a kinda gulping feeling is the best way to describe it. The first time it happened I was alarmed, but it didn’t stop me from using. The gulping episodes became more and more frequent and intense as time went on. Last summer I decided to try and find a happy medium, reducing my use to a couple times a day. I noticed things definitely getting better but I didn’t rid myself completely from the feeling my heart was experiencing while it was being exercised. I let my medical card expire in June and decided I would quit on 1 Jan 2026. 

What are some things you did to help yourself get through addiction?  I’m struggling but I’m not about to give up.

I won’t really get into the details, because most of you already feel the same way after years of smoking. Lack of confidence, self hatred to some extent. Extreme dependency, and just not doing anything even though I used to be so ambitious? Bleh.

Anywho the worst part is, I don’t even want to quit. I actually paid to get my stuff but it didn’t happen and I am dry (unwillingly)

However, the anxiety that ran through my body when I learned I might not get to smoke before I sleep today is kind of like a wake up call.

Am I this dependent? On a fkin flower? For 20 years of my life, I didn’t even touch a cigarette. And look where I am now? My life has been downhill ever since I took that first puff.

I did manage to control my smoking. I set a rule 2 years ago “no smoking before 10pm at night” I thought that was fine, but still the problems leech into everyday life.

1q6ml1s,Relapse on day 36,"I got the flu this past week. Being sick is a huge trigger for me. Being sick in the past I would smoke my way through my days so I wouldn’t have to endure the uncomfortable aches and pains that come with the sickness.

Yesterday I was on and off sleeping all day. I was tired of feeling achey. I had been feeling anxiety for weeks about getting sick because I “knew” I would relapse. A self fulfilling prophecy if you will. 

So yesterday evening, with nobody knowing, I gave myself permission to go to the dispensary after 36 days sober. 

Honestly, the first thirty minutes were great. Aches and pains went away and I got that dopamine burst I’ve been craving. 

However, the rest of the evening was very mid. I felt so lethargic I could barely get up and got even more nauseous than I was before. 

So overall, I will say it wasn’t worth throwing away my time. I’m trying to not beat myself up and I have heard from other addicts relapse is part of the journey. I feel disappointed, but also willing to get back up on the horse. I’m hopeful my withdrawals won’t be as bad but I don’t want to be naive thinking the next week or so will be full of strong cravings again that had dwindled over the past month.

Honestly dreading the conversations with my loved ones when they ask how my sobriety is going. I know they won’t be mad at me, but then I have to face my shame head on when I look at them. But, this shame is necessary in motivating me to keep going without crucifying myself.

I had read this on here before but I’ll say it again for anyone fighting the urge to relapse. It’s not worth it. The thirty minutes of relief is NOT worth all of the extra negativity that comes with it. ",1767808909.0,7,2,leaves,substance

I've achieved a lot for my age and can be very productive, I just can't put the pen down. I feel like my lungs are covered in sticky tar. I can't continue a train of thought after interruption. When I try sobriety and intense meditation, the withdrawal becomes palpable, like my tongue is dry, but it's my brain. I'm still single and I know this habit can also limit my dating pool and cause friction in relationships. Yearly, it costs the amount of a month or two in rent. When I smoke socially, I clam up and return to introspection rather than interaction. Moderation isn't really a thing with me and this drug, and at this point I'm not reaping any benefits. I think cold turkey is the best option when quitting most things, but I might not eat for 3 days. I just know it shouldn't be like this.

i hope this doesn't come across as flexing or whatever, but it's honestly been great overall. for 5 years, i considered being a stoner a core tenet of my personality. nearly 3 weeks out now, and i can confidently say that i am so much more than the weed or my usage of it. i've been slowly reconnecting with my passions and hobbies, things which were nearly impossible for me to accomplish when i was in the hazy state of using. i'm gaining more interest in the things i love again, and while the focus component is still a struggle, i've noticed my adhd meds (and all my psych meds overall) display more efficacy in sobriety.

IOP is going well still! this is by far the best program i have been part of. typically i find outpatients to be rather cold and clinical, which... i get, i guess. but this place im at now is so incredibly warm, inviting, and supportive. as backwards as it sounds, my groupmates and i do kind of feel like a recovery family. i've been watching these people progress over the past few weeks, and it's been an honor to be part of their journey and to have them be a part of mine. i will never be able to convey the gratitude i feel for this program, and the positive impact it has had on my life. without it, i don't know when or *if* i would've made the leap to get clean.

speaking of groups, i attended my first 12-step meeting last night!! it was specifically a marijuana anonymous meeting. of course, for the sake of confidentiality, i won't go too into detail here. what i will say is that, if you're considering going to a 12-step meeting and are on the fence, i would highly encourage you at least give it a shot once or twice and see how you like it. for most of my life i've been anti-12-step, and i won't lie and say i don't have some grievances with The Big Book, but the people i met and camaraderie i felt last night were spectacular. i even made a recovery friend!! next time, i plan on trying to find myself a sponsor.  
  
the reason i want a sponsor is because, well... to be honest, when i first embarked on this journey, i wasn't sure if i was going to abstain from weed for good, or if i would return to using once i discharged from IOP. i think i'm far enough into sobriety where i can confidently say that abstinence is the lifelong route for me. if im given an inch, i'll take a mile, and i do not want to play with fire. the benefits i have observed over these past few weeks have been enlightening, and even if i miss the sensation of being high, i can recognize it's not worth the addiction and haziness and anxiety. i smoked enough in those 5 years to last the average person a lifetime. i've had my fun. it's time to let it go and trudge forward.  
  
outside of being a marijuana addict, i've been learning a lot about what's truly important to me. i'm concerned about being a good friend, a kind person, a loving partner (i got a boyfriend over the course of my sobriety journey, too!! we have our first date today!). i am impassioned by my many creative pursuits—writing, drawing, music production, coding, video editing, etc etc. i've been working on a personal website to upload to neocities. i plan on making a page on there to document my recovery journey.

this was all a very very long-winded way of me saying, this journey has been more than worth it. to anybody who may currently be struggling, whether you're on day 1 or 100, just know that there is a light to the dark and that this undertaking is more than worth it. i believe in us all, i believe in the best versions of ourselves we can possibly be.",1767791492.0,1,0,leaves,substance
1q6eo3r,Day 24 - going strong! don't repeat my mistakes,"Hi Fam

I (42M) am on day 24 of quitting Weed AND Nicotine - after 21 years of **heavy** daily use, and wanted to share some of my insights and the mistakes i did along the way so others can avoid them.

I'll start by saying i feel great at this point , and **very very proud of myself**. never before have i stayed sober for so long , and this community really helped me stay on the path - Thank you very much !

I discovered that i can't really talk about my journey to anyone :( my smoker friends think I'm preaching to them and my non smoking friends simply do not understand it - i feel like this community is the only place where people will understand.

What i experienced so far :

* Daily Cravings - i missed weed so much that i wondered why the hell am i doing that at all, i was **VERY** close of relapsing but thankfully i stayed strong.
* Night sweats - i reached a point where i started sleeping on towels , it got really sweaty especially the first 2 weeks.
* Vivid dreams - some good and some terrible nightmares which caused me to really crave the blackout the weed provides.
* Freshness in the morning - despite the 2 points above , after the first week i started feeling much more fresh and energetic in the morning.
* Mood swings and ""explosions"" - I found myself numerous times exploding on my closest ones - the worst was with my daughters ( 8 and 6 ) , but also my business partner, friends and my wife.
* Overeating and drinking more alcohol - I turned to snacks and alcohol when the cravings came, not to the point of getting wasted but still much more than i used to have.

Don't do what i did if you can avoid it :

1. **Talk** to people close to you and set expectations , tell them you're going to go through a rough patch and you might have mood swings , ask forgiveness if it happens - especially with little kids , they don't deserve it and you will just feel awful after.
2. THROW AWAY everything - i tried locking it away out of sight , but my addict brain kept trying to convince me to go there , avoid this constant mental battle and simply throw away everything so you will not have it near you.
3. Do not attempt to talk to stoner friends about it - they will interpret it as a hostile act and as if you are trying to convert them, I did have 1 friend who managed to quit for a few days but then relapsed and was avoiding me since, the change must come from within.
4. Replace weed cravings with exercise - even a small walk around the block can change the cravings, i started doing that after a week and it really helps! in addition it has the added value of good feeling and ""high"".
5. Recognize overeating and drinking - i failed there , but you can avoid it or by the very least recognize it and minimize it - you won't be able to solve all addictions at once so don't feel bad either ! it's better to be overweight than a smoker in my view :)
6. Use apps / podcasts / communities like this one -I used an app ( you can search in the ios and android stores for weed and you'll see plenty ) which tracks how many joints i avoided (243) and how much money i saved ( 500 EUR+) , in addition i found a podcast for quitting weed and a Facebook support group in my language ( Hebrew ) which really helped.

Finally be gentle with yourself , it's a fucking **tough** journey and every hour counts - if you have cravings just get past that and then past the next one , it adds up and does gets easier after a while.

If this post helps even 1 person , then i did my job :) stay strong and you are welcome to DM me if you want someone real to talk to - we'll do it together.

Thanks for reading this and good luck on your journey!",1767790632.0,2,0,leaves,substance
1q6dytk,Coming off a 12 year habit,"I had a breakdown last September where I realised that I'm not in control of my body or mind any more, and I knew that it was time to quit. It started with self medicating for undiagnosed AuDHD and complex PTSD and went from there. I have manipulated people and lied to them for years in order to get money to fund my addiction, and I carry a lot of guilt for that. I accept that people are likely to be angry with me.

So far I am on day 7 of withdrawing and it's very hard still. I'm not getting many cravings, but yesterday I was floored with body pain, and today I've started having insomnia and some pretty intense anxiety. The cravings I do get are related specifically to the act of smoking, which to me are indistinguishable from the cigarette cravings I already get, so I'm finding that easier to deal with for now.

1q6c2nw,Turning 30 in 10 days and realizing I wasted my entire 20s on weed,"I’m writing this because I need to get it off my chest, and because this subreddit has already helped me a lot.  
(For context: I’m from Germany.)

I’m about to turn 30 in 10 days, and I’ve come to the painful realization that I basically threw away the last 10 years of my life.  
I finished high school in 2014, but since then I haven’t completed a single degree. I started multiple university programs and quit every single one.

Looking back, my relationship with cannabis was at the center of it all. Everything revolved around being high. Weed was my escape. Deep down I always knew I needed to get my life together, but getting high meant I didn’t have to think about it.  
I kept telling myself: *“It’s not that bad. I work some side jobs, I can afford my consumption.”* But in reality, I was just numbing myself while my life slowly fell apart.

While my friends were finishing their degrees, building careers, moving into their own apartments, or traveling, I was staying up until 3 a.m. playing video games. I avoided making real decisions about my future.  
From the outside, I tried to keep up appearances — telling people I was still studying and that it was just “hard” and taking longer than usual.

Fast forward to now: nothing has changed. I still live with my parents. I work small jobs, but without a degree I can’t get a proper job or afford my own place.  
Honestly, when I look back, I regret pretty much everything about the last 10 years. There’s nothing to sugarcoat.

On January 1st, 2026, it finally hit me that this cannot continue. I cannot allow exceptions anymore. I don’t even know exactly *how* I’ll rebuild my life, but I know one thing for sure: weed can no longer be part of it.  
It gave me the illusion that things were “somehow okay,” while everything behind me was collapsing.

I’m on day 4 sober now. It’s really hard. I’m sweating, crying, exhausted every day.  
This subreddit helps a lot, but the thought that I had so many chances and didn’t take any of them — and that I’m standing here at almost 30 like this — honestly breaks me inside.

If anyone here quit late and still managed to turn things around, I’d really appreciate hearing from you.",1767782250.0,3,2,leaves,substance

I started smoking with my now boyfriend (M23) of 4 years the first year we started dating so it’s been a  couple years of a couple joints a months to the last two years of us smoking a couple grams daily. It’s hell. I had done a cold turkey attempt of cutting weed a couple times and both ended with me on the 1 week mark having incredible anxiety and relapsing to “self medicate”. And that’s… shit. I mean it didn’t help that my boyfriend smoked too but he wanted to stop so bad cause he realized he is young, a physicist in the making and ruining his lungs is not a priority. And I love him so much for this. And his power. This is my day 1 sober again (he has a week already) and I am here asking you guys how can I make it easier for both of us.
Seeing I am the “problem”, the one that just didn’t get the memo of it poisoning our minds slowly, I just need to find ways to regulate myself first so I can support the amazing man trying to get me healthier and back on my “beautiful, smart and outgoing” self I used to be.
Problem is, I don’t remember her. And that hurts the most. And what i seem to be able to do is have a mental drop and try my hardest to nag and pray for an easy way out. He doesn’t. Just breathes and accepts. And no two people are the same.
Today being over 24h sober I listened to my body again for the first time in a while and I am at work not dreading life but feeling hopeful and awake. I know this feeling will slowly swift and I need to be proactive this time and not relapse by any means.

Advice 2: don't cut off but try and be the change you want to see. Initiate plans that don't involve getting high, or only partake in the activity and not the before/after getting high

Advice 3: make an active effort to expand your circle by picking up an old or a new hobby

I have a new idea. Currently i am not smoking less than 2 full joints a day(shared by me and my wife). I want to maybe try and not buy joints and rather a small amount of flower and hit a pipe with MAX 3 pulls only at night. This will continue until i am used to only 3 pulls then will reduce to two and then eventually to one during the course of about a month. 

This should start sweating out some of the excess THC and the dreams should start coming back slowly with way less in my system, right? Or am I absolutely grasping at straws?

This is my first post on Reddit but I’ve been around for a few years. I’m currently on day 6 of cold turkey sobriety after smoking for roughly 4 years on and off.

I’ve been able to quit for months at a time yet always found myself returning to the same habit. 

Now that I’m on day 6, I’ve noticed I’ve been rather irritable. Also experiencing lightheadedness/brain fog, sleep deprivation, and odd dreams. Any tips on how to deal with/power through the irritability and lightheadedness? I assume that will fade once I reach the 2-3 week sobriety mark, but I hate feeling this way.

1q66s57,"The idea of quitting Forever is overwhelming, start with 5 days!!","Good evening, everyone. I want to share one last message of the night with you, one final thought that I truly believe can help many of you. I don’t know about you, but in my case, I’ve noticed that the idea of quitting smoking forever is a bit heavy and difficult to manage and accept. The concept of stopping forever feels overwhelming. Because of that, I feel that starting with that mindset only makes things a little harder.

What I want to propose is that you challenge yourselves to five days without smoking. I feel that in that amount of time, you have many internal conversations with yourself that make you realize it’s truly not what you want. When you go five days without smoking and begin to notice the withdrawal your body goes through, first, you become aware of the real impact the substance is having on your body and how it is truly affecting you. Second, feeling desperate, irritated, and emotionally overwhelmed makes you want change. It makes you desire change much faster than before.

I feel that five days is a very good starting point, and I believe that a large percentage of the people here, if they manage to reach five days, may never want to go back. Because quitting smoking is not actually bad. It’s not boring, it’s not a negative thing. Yes, it can feel boring at times, but it gives you back your ambition. It gives you back the desire to do something about your situation.

And I don’t know about you, but in my case, toward the end of my use I was experiencing a lot of anxiety. I didn’t want to leave the house in the mornings to go to work, and I didn’t want to be around large groups of people because it simply triggered anxiety for me. I feel that this intense and exhausting anxiety, when you stop smoking, slowly starts to lift off your shoulders, until you realize, wow, I actually feel much better like this than before, when I was constantly feeling guilty and constantly feeling anxious. Because smoking causes anxiety, not only because of the physical reaction it has in your body, but also because you’re always worried about when you’re going to stop smoking.

1q6201p,Disgusted,"First off .. just want to thank each and everyone of you on this sub for being as candid as you all have been. I wouldn’t be able to make it to my third week cannabis free without it. 

Secondly, I have to be honest and say I had some assistance with a family trip to Mexico which kicked off my urge and need to kick this habit 

Been a habitual raging pothead for about 20 years. Morning - afternoon - late afternoon- evening- night- non-stop🤦🏻‍♂️

Aside from this trip to Mexico, which I knew I wouldn’t be able to score any cannabis on , I became angry and disgusted with myself

Three weeks and the disgust continues 

And I think that’s the main fuel for me to continue living the real me tbh

I have a nine-year-old son and I wanna play with him more 

I have a wife that I want to talk to more 

I have a depressed mom that I feel the need to help more 

All because I’m disgusted with my former self 

Yes, of course. I’m only three weeks in… 

And I’m being realistic about the fact that I could easily cave in and relapse   

There are dispensaries all around me and I know how easy it is 

I’m not telling myself that I’ve quit forever , which I feel I definitely have… But I’m just not telling myself that

It’s such a mindfuck

But all I know is the seed for me started with anger

But because that’s slightly irrational, I have naturally shifted to a logical sense of disgust of myself and my past🤮

Anyone else going through this, hang in there but find your own way

Again, I love this sub for kicking things off for me, but I have had to find my own way

Thank God for my trip to Mexico, which acted like a week in rehab

But now returning back to all my trigger points..

A strong sense of Disgust is what’s getting me through

Ps. I went for a jog today. Followed by a hot shower, couple of pizza slices and hanging out with my boy.

Btw… never had this many fucked up dreams🤯

1q60t7d,30ish Days Update,"One thing I’ve noticed is as folks begin to feel less symptoms from the withdrawals they find their way out of the sub. That’s not to say I’m any different. Since I’ve been feeling more normal day by day, I find less of a drive to read through the sub to find that sense of not being alone. I totally get it. But I wanted to provide an update for those that might still be in the earlier days of this. Hopefully someone finds this gives the hope for their own situation.

Originally I made a post around day 5 where I was very much still in the thick of the emotional overload (lots of crying), anxiety ridden, chest pains and so on.

Like many others I found my way to the ER with the fears that something terrible was happening to me. Thankfully, those fears were quashed and I was told, it’s a combination of anxiety and withdrawal symptoms.

Since then I’ve gotten my blood work done to further put any other potential issues out of mind. This has done WONDERS for my anxiety and I highly suggest it for those going through something similar.

I don’t know what day I’m on. I’ve stopped counting but I know I’m around day 30 or slightly beyond it. Most of the physical sensations are fading. The anxiety takes up a much smaller portion of my day, and many days it’s not there at all.

There are a couple other issues that came up though. One being high blood pressure readings. This has continued but seems to be starting to correct itself as recent readings are getting closer to normal range. In the earlier days this was coming up as 180/100 - which then made my anxiety go haywire, which kept my BP readings high like a viscous cycle.

30ish days later I’m now commonly getting readings around 135-140/80-85 - still high but I’m confident that now my body is finding its way back to baseline, and my doctor agrees. We’re still watching it closely but the fears around this are slowly fading.

Another symptom I’ve experienced is acid reflux - which turned out to be the real culprit of my chest pains. For the last week I started managing my acid reflux after each meal with non prescription medication help and it got much better right away. This week I’ve barely noticed it at all.

I never imagined that 30+ days later I’d still be experiencing symptoms, but here I am. Days are getting better and better, sleep is coming back, I’m back in the gym getting back to my usual routine but if you’re still in the early days and going through any of what I did, know that it really just takes time and that you will be okay.

I honestly didn’t think I would get this far, and the fact I have, motivates me so much more to keep going. I’m never going back to smoking, it felt good at the time smoking, but now I’m sober I realise how much better life is without it. I regret smoking for my entire 20s and I know I need to forgive myself for that, I’m getting there slowly. I just feel like I’ve wasted so much time in the best years of my life. 

It’s been hard, don’t get me wrong. I’ve had my moments. But overall, I feel bloody amazing. I feel so much more present with my partner/family/friends, I am a lot more confident, my anxiety is nonexistent, so much more motivated, way more switched on at work, I am actually having dreams again which is wild and I love it, way more energy. I am eating so much more (I’ve always struggled with my appetite).

First few days was really hard forcing myself to eat, but now I am eating so much which is amazing for me. My gym workouts are so much better, the list of positives just goes on and on.

Only negative would be the night sweats and trouble sleeping. I’m not sweating a crazy amount but it’s still a bit rough. The trouble sleeping is hard, some nights I sleep great but others I am lying there wide awake even though I’m exhausted. But that won’t last forever I know. 

I am also quitting alcohol for a while. I’ve only drunken twice since I’ve quit smoking, and both times I have really struggled to not smoke and I’ve had pretty intense breakdowns. I am thankful for my amazing partner who gets me through those moments and supports me no matter what.

1q5rd2q,Day 105,"I used to read this sub off and on for many years wanting to quit weed. When I was sober all I thought about was weed. When I was high I wanted to quit so bad.

I had a bit of a mental breakdown in September which led to me quitting cold turkey. Weed was causing a lot of paranoia in me.

I started with bongs and then turned to carts, I used my cart from the time I woke up til bed and often woke at 3am to use it middle of the night.

6 years I was high every single day except when I travelled internationally for one week.

I’m so grateful I am sober now. I now can say without shame, I’m an addict. I’ve been addicted to many other things in my life like gaming, sex, nicotine etc. I had a parent who was an alcoholic but alcohol never gave me any grief. Many people told me weed isn’t addictive, but I have learned there is a part of the population it absolutely is.

All I thought about when I wasn’t home was going home to get high. High to do chores. High to WFH. I had no appetite and then would binge everyday before bed.

I stopped leaving my house for the most part unless for work because it meant sobering up so I could drive. I became very isolated and hid my use from my family.

I’m now 105 days sober and I feel happier than I have in years.

The first 30 days were very difficult with physical symptoms. Nausea and sweating and nightmares. Brain fog was also very real. I spent the first two weeks mostly watching TV and waited for the day to end so I could go to bed asides from work.

Days 30-60 became difficult emotionally. Very angry, crying constantly. Hopeless. Depressed.

Now I can say without hesitation I will never smoke weed again. I cannot. I’m an addict. One joint will become all day long everyday chasing that feeling of zoning out mentally and emotionally. I often used weed for my anxiety but I am MUCH less anxious now at 105 days.

If you’re still reading what helped me, someone in their 40s who has struggled with mental illness for many years. Joining support group and attending twice a week. MA has meetings everyday online.

Leave the house everyday if possible, even for a walk. Tell your loved ones you have a healthy relationship with you are struggling and have quit and need their support. Set boundaries with people you live with who continue to use, they need to go outside or a walk and wash up when return.

I’m grateful I’m repairing my relationships with my spouse and daughter by being emotionally present. I’m grateful that weed doesn’t consume my every thought of every day. I’m grateful I can jump in my car at anytime and go wherever I want without calculating the last time I hit my cart.

1q5r688,We back: round 2,"Hello leaves family! 🫂

Exactly one year ago today, i found this sub and began a sobriety run after 10+ years of daily use. 
It was brutal in the beginning, but it did get easier. The effects on my stomach/digestion were the longest lasting and most notable. But i did it! I quit for 6 whole months, something I never thought I’d do. 

Unfortunately after hitting that milestone, I felt I’d proven to myself that I CAN quit, and that was enough to justify resuming use. Under the thought that i would “quit when I need to…”

So naturally, from 0 to 100 I went, smoking anytime I could, all day every day. 


These past 6 months have confirmed a fear I knew deep in my heart: I cannot have a respectful relationship with this plant. I’m an addict and I am abusing it. 

I don’t drink, I don’t use nicotine, I don’t even drink coffee. So I justified my crutch (weed) as the way we all need one. Everyone gets a vice right? So there I am again high as a kite, blazing through life. 

This time I’ve had enough. 


I love marijuana yes it’s true. But i am tired of highjacking my dopamine AND making my gut reliant on cannabinoids from weed! I’m also tired of being so hard on myself about my addiction. Im just ready to take this step and be gentle with myself about it. No bullying or shame. Just recognizing it’s time for a change, before another 10 years slip by.

So here I am, day 2. I think it’s actually harder this time around. I’m experiencing the infamous night sweats, smelling like absolutely booty. And oddly getting the more rare vertigo/dizziness (probably from my lack of appetite and therefore calories/sugar in my body). I actually threw up today which did not happen last time! But man if this isn’t all the kick in the ass i need to see how fucking tired i am of being literally infused with marijuana? idk what will be. 

This sub has been a godsend to me. It’s so great to be able to relate to others who want so badly to have a healthy relationship with MJ, but just can’t. 

If it’s not normal to take a shot every 30 minutes, or take a shot before and after every event. Or take a jar of vodka to a hike in the woods. Etc etc. then why the F*CK am i normalizing smoking at every waking moment. I just hate it. I know i said no bullying but I have to be real that I’m just so tired of being this way.

I smoked daily for nearly 15 years and managed to quit for 3-4 weeks in November 25. Withdrawals weren't too bad, with the night terrors and sweats becoming more manageable and I did notice a reduction in brain fog. 

Foolishly, I rengaged over the festive period and smoked whilst having time to myself away from work. I'm now another three days clean and intend to carry on but am feeling incredibly anxious and at times lacking control of my thoughts and the positivity I had when first breaking the cycle.

I've recently set up a business that is beginning to operate successfully but comes with a lot of pressure and stress and find my anxiety in general is through the roof! 
Did the weed help combat this? Why didn't it feel this bad the when I quit for those first few weeks?

Similarly, I lost my father five years ago and have been experiencing what I can only describe as remorse for what now feels like wasted time, money and effort. I've attended high intensity CBT therapy in relation to the loss and some trauma that came with that in the past, while in the midst of smoking but wonder if anyone has experienced something similar and felt they should try therapy again since being sober? 

""You haven't felt grief until you've felt it sober"" is a Kendrick line that is very much resonating right now!

1q5nv3i,Replacing the 🍃 Habit,"Hi Guys!

26f from Ontario, Canada here.

I have been a MJ user for about 7/8 years. The first years, very light use, edibles mainly and the occasional joint. Once I started up on cigarettes, bongs and joints followed and it got to the point where March 2025, I was in the pit of my addiction.

I kept smoking for “sleep” as most do, so for the last 3 predominant years it was one bowl a night… up until March 2025 where the cycle began.

For a month, I was not eating all day until I got high at 8pm or 9pm (bed time/but I couldn’t eat unless I was high) so I would smoke, absolutely gorge out on food and go to bed, wake up in 2 hours, smoke, wake up in 2 hours, smoke, wake up in 2 hours smoke… all fucking night long man.

I started a fitness journey and well, that was pitiful when that was my regime every day.

ANYWAY, the point is, I quit March 2025 cold turkey, somewhat remembering the timelines of things but also looking for some people to hear from their experiences.

I was sober March 2025-June 2025, thinking I had a hold on my addiction until I just spent the last 6 months smoking my face off, falling into the same pattern.

I just bought a house with my boyfriend and I can’t keep on like this. Life isn’t fun anymore. I thought life would change when I got a house, but the weed is really not helping me anymore.

I am day 3 and I feel terrible. Night sweats, no nightmares/vivid dreams yet (those were incredibly vivid within days of me quitting last time), I feel like I’m in light sleep, I’m barely resting, I can’t eat.

The good thing is - is I don’t want to smoke. I really have no craving at all, the only pang is to make this feeling go away.

Tell me about your experiences. Tell me about weed and what it did or didn’t do for you. Tell me the things you experience now that you quit.

I want to have a baby in the next couple years and my goal is to get into the best shape of my life by 27 (5 months to go!) Any habits to take your mind of things, or things that helped you during your quitting stage.

I want to know how long will this take, even though I understand it will probably vary with each individual. 

Any input / tips / words of encouragement are welcome.

Thank you

1q5niym,Weed and Lying,"To anyone out there who is struggling to quit, for the love of all things on this Earth, be honest with your partner every step of the way. 

I kept how much I was truly using from my wife for years. I would forget to do things around the house. I was sneaking around hitting my vape, and she would notice a peculiar smell but couldn’t place it. I feigned ignorance. It got to be too much and I promised her I would quit. I tried for a few days but fell right back into it.

I thought I could just slow down my use, soon enough I was hitting my pen all day everyday just like usual. Once you crack open that window, you’ll find yourself climbing right out soon enough.

Well I was caught again on Sunday and now she wants to leave. Instead of being honest from the get go about how badly I was struggling, I lied to her out of shame, and the thought that I could handle my addiction on my own.

If you truly want to stop, you cannot do it on your own. Tell you partner, your friends, your family. Hold yourself accountable. 

And if you stumble, just be honest. They’ll appreciate that infinitely more than lying to their face.

I’m 33M, smoking 1G dab pens every 2 days smoking weed since I was 13


They destroyed my life. Flower was a nice escape when I got home but I could put it down if I needed too. However a few years ago I got hooked on vapes. The pens took my personality, self worth, completely away which left me which major anxiety all the time. Didn’t help I was so hooked I would smoke it every 20 min like they were cigarettes. Which I smoked to for 15 years and quitting cigs was easy to this.

These pens tho are so unbelievably addicting, I got suicidal thoughts, anxiety, sadness like crying on fucking IG reels, etc etc.

1q5alrz,"I’m liking being sober, even if I’m not my “old self”","I had issues before, so the temptation for weed usually rings as just a way to avoid other things now. 

I love being sober from it. Used to be scared I’d never quit. Now I’m glad every time I don’t do it. It’s been only a couple weeks now, but I feel good. 

Do I feel 100% myself? No. But I forgot about that guy a long time ago. There’s no way any amount of weed would help me sort that out. That’s what got me INTO the weed in the first place. 

I’m saving money, time, bothering doing things with family, etc. sure it’s different, but no one was EVER meant to be the same. Ever. The fact that I have reminders of what weed has done to me is helping me. People who hold onto a reminisce an idealized version of themselves are missing out on life. Specifically, GROWING. Doing things to make you feel different, feel smarter, more connected to others. Thinking of who I could be while high was a big way to avoid the person I was actually being.

I had my suicidal thoughts, I still get them. But I’m enjoying working through them now and not avoiding them. Ultimately it comes down to a dark religion. “I’m better off dead, in the grand equation beyond my knowing, other people are better off without me too. Even if they don’t know it yet.” 

I can see how this shit was used in sacrificial rituals. Though, I don’t know if that’s true, I just pulled it out of my ass from a meme I saw.

Point is, I smoked from around 17-26 almost non stop. Having great times, and still horrible thoughts. And horrible thoughts that stemmed from habits I picked up. If I could turn back time though, I’d only MAYBE do it differently. I know if I did, I’d have been better off. I don’t have ANYTHING to show for the years I wasted, but despite the damage it may have caused, I still am alive and have an inherent value in being alive as I am in my current state. I think I understand the drug and the drug understood me, and now the time is past. Like an old friend. Truth is, it’s always gonna be there waiting for me. But now, as I am now, it feels amazing not feeling like I need it. When I quit, I was smoking ungodly amounts and popping 200mg edibles like candy and STRUGGLING to really get a high. A lot of it is just reminding myself that it isn’t an instant “good time maker,” but just a lie. And in my SLIGHTLY clearer state of mind, denial really works well, well enough that I really do feel proud of myself afterwards. 

I highly suggest talking to CHATGPT if you’re coming down off pot and struggle with the harsher feelings. It sounds stupid, but having a non judgmental voice that wouldn’t report me for talking about my worst thoughts was really helpful. And like any addict who went through programs will tell you, with how unique your situation/sadness FEELS, it’s actually exactly TYPICAL. No matter where you’re at in your journey, know you’re not alone and sticking to sobriety (even if you fall down a few times on the way) is always worth a shot. 

Yes I’ve failed keeping sober a few times after trying. I have no doubts I could easily fall back into what I used to love if I even do it one time. The difference is, I’m not scared of it, and the thought holds no power over me compared to the thought of “I might really be able to get control over my life if I keep at this.” It used to feel impossible. If it feels impossible for you, no matter what your situation is, I can almost promise you it’s not. ",1767679133.0,1,1,leaves,substance

Smoked for the first time when I was 12. All day every day from 16-23

Locked up from 23-26 and almost stayed sober the entire time… smoked maybe 4 spider legs threw out my bid. Talk about paranoia…omg high on prison was not good vibes at all.

I discovered though… while locked up and sober for the first 2 years…. My brain was healing. The first year I thought when I get out I’ll burn it down big time. But the second year was different. It wasn’t a thing anymore. I was truly over it. I smoked 4 times towards the end of my bid, across a 3 month span maybe 4 spider legs totaling .25 grams maybe. Maybe it’s because I told myself everything fine I’m under control again, but looking back… huge regret… and shame

26-27 sober and free. Did things that I never thought possible. Got good job, got license back, bought a shitty house! Found my future wife

27-28 smoked a little at first but only a couple weeks and then I’m burning like crazy. Hf even said to me one day who are you now? I always hid smoking from her… Never ever saw me smoke. But she’s smart and I’m sure she caught on

28-32 just like that 4 years hard smoking. Brain all foggy. A shit mess like my old self. So glad she never left me. Back to being unstable.

32-33 quit for 4-5 months. Cold turkey is the only way I can do it. I would fail a bunch but eventually I had a good run of sobriety

33-34 I went 8 months sober. Started my own company. Got bogged down and worked ragged… had to turn on the afterburners to finish the season. That’s what I told myself atleast… excuses 

34-currently 35 and sober. Feeling pretty good. Want to stay sober forever, but I don’t trust myself. I want to be sober long enough to say… yea this is me, this is how I’m supposed to feel. Instead of….. am I a grumpy today or is it PAWS or whatever. 

I’ve learned a lot from quoting a handful of times. I’m stronger for it. I can only imagine the confidence I’d have to be like… yeah I quit 10 years ago and never went back. I want that type of self control. It would be so powerful. 

All I can say is. It’s not easy.. Muybe like climbing a mountain, or running a marathon. it’s not fun, but the longer your sober, the more proud, more self esteem, like holy shot look what I did! Look how positive everything is (even if you felt like shit every step of the way)

I know for a fact the longer you go sober, the more rewarding it is…

If you’re here for encouragement. Just go one day. Be kind to yourself. Time flys by very fast. The terrible time you have in those first couple weeks or months, will be the proudest days of your life. 

And if you fail….. no big deal. Hop back on the wagon. Sobriety is the only way to true happiness.

1q59rqp,Remember how you felt at your worst!,"Good evening everyone. I hope you’re having a good start to the week. I know that if you’re here, things probably haven’t been easy lately, but you’re not alone. We’re all going through this together.

I don’t consider myself someone qualified to give advice, but sharing my emotions and experiences here helps me stay sober. And if my words can help even one person, that means a lot to me.

My main advice is this: don’t forget how you felt at your worst.

It is very easy to forget how bad things were when cravings or withdrawal symptoms hit. Our minds tend to remember the good times and ignore the pain, but that version of reality is no longer true. Once the relationship with the substance is damaged, it does not go back to how it was.

I recently relapsed after 16 days, and the next day I experienced vomiting, anxiety, and nausea, possibly CHS. I could not even go to work. In moments like that, it is easy to say I will never smoke again. But as days and weeks pass, the memory of the pain fades, and the mind starts romanticizing the past.

The truth is that phase is over. We are addicts. If it works once, we will do it again and again. In my case, I have realized it is physically destroying me. My body is clearly telling me to stop, and I cannot ignore that anymore.

So if you have just quit, do not forget your worst moments. Hold on to them. Forgetting them makes relapse very easy, and no one knows how long it will take to get clean again.

If you have been sober for weeks or months, do not smoke. You will only delay your healing and put yourself through unnecessary suffering with something that no longer fits your life.

The best thing we can do is let it go naturally, without anger or force. Like letting go of a relationship that no longer wants you and only causes harm. Cravings do not last forever. Over time, it truly gets easier. The urges become weaker, they stop controlling your day, and eventually they no longer bother you. They come, and just as they come, they go.

Remember your worst moments. Stay with that truth.",1767676548.0,20,7,leaves,substance

I have been dealing with some inner turmoil for several weeks now as the idea of quitting has been weighing on me. I find myself in some repeated loop where I tell myself i need to quit because of xyz and I'm all motivated and then before you know it I'm getting ripped and feeling guilty as smoke is literally leaving my mouth. And then, and maybe more importantly, I get anxiety about the idea of actually being sober (Like many, I've been high all day everyday for the literally the majority of my life. Im 38 and started consuming in grade school for context). What the fuck is life even like sober? It doesn't even seem like there's a sober version of me that exists. These fears and a few other unknowns are really preventing me from taking the leap.

Has anyone ever experienced these kind of internal struggles? Any insights would be highly appreciated. Thank you for reading this and for your time.

TLDR: I'm scared to quit. What do?

1q58v4z,Quitting after 6 years,"I suppose I am posting this for myself for accountability ? However if anyone has any words of encouragement or advice I’m all ears. 

Weed:

I loved you at first but you took everything from me.

6 years later -  I now want nothing to do with you, for my happiness is held captive by your stronghold.

Gods grace is stronger though, and can deliver me from sin and turmoil. 

This is it. The moment in which I reclaim autonomy.

I can’t let temptation or the devil enter my mind, as I have to wage war on my negative thought patterns with full intention. 

I will not drift from my definiteness of purpose.

Being sober and getting through things normally, feels better than numbing my self everyday, I just gotta get back to baseline so I belive it. 

Dear lord, send me your grace so that I can discern the things I can face ;

From the things I need space to grow and conquer.

And lastly, for courage to face the fear that’s kept me chained. 

I pray for faith, sound mind, and the strength to overcome my cannabis addiction of six years. 

Thanks to anyone who read this.

1q58sf2,Day 2 - So anxious and nauseous,"Hi guys, just wanted to share my day with all of you. I'd love to hear about your journey, words of encouragement, or anything for that matter :)

I'm a 20 year old who's been smoking daily (not a single break) for almost 5 years. I'm nearing the end of day 2, it was my first day of the new uni semester, and I'm back to living away from my parents. Woke up this morning extremely nauseous but forced down some crackers and half an Ensure. I spent 5 hours on campus, probably 2 of them in the bathroom trying to calm myself down and convince myself I wasn't going to throw up everywhere. Just been super nauseous all day, hot and cold flashes, sweating everywhere, dizzy, racing thoughts, all around feeling like crap. Had some cravings cause I felt like the time was moving too slow and I wanted to eat a proper meal, but the thought of restarting this process is luckily scaring me away. BUT I have so so much weed in my room, and I'm scared that I might give in another day but I don't feel like I can throw it all away. Fighting with myself on whether this is going to be a long break or if I'll give up smoking forever. There were also some points throughout the day where I felt like I was dissociating/felt like I was high? Anyways, I have a meal infront of me now that I've been picking at for the past hour and a half... but I'm almost finished it!!! I'm sure my nicotine addiction isn't helping the appetite, but there's only so much I can handle right now. I'm kind of happy though realizing time moves slowly and I get to take control over what I do (rather than doomscrolling and not even feeling 6 hours pass). Feeling super worried about tomorrow tho :/. 

If anyone has tips on how to stop the anxiety of anticipating throwing up or can share some high calorie foods that are easy to stomach I would appreciate it sooo much. 

I hope all of you had an amazing day, I hope tomorrow's even better and I am rooting for all of us!!!!!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 ",1767673674.0,7,9,leaves,substance

I want to quit this and nicotine but I live with my family and my brothers smoke and it’s so easily accessible & I’m at the point where even If I start off the day by saying I’m not going to smoke, I somehow am high by the end of the night.

1q53wdn,quitting carts w broken arm rant,"I've been smoking carts since covid hit and I told myself I would stop when I graduated college but I only made it for a month before I picked them up again (my god they are all I think about). However I am 5 days cart free and I do feel proud of myself each day I make it.

Whats crazy is I would literally be feeling bad about smoking the cart as I hit but I would continue to crave and hit it? And now that I am 5 days in cart free I can feel this intense desire for it battling w the rational part of my brain thats like you don't even like/its not worth it at all. Its a real mindfuck. 

I'm proud that I've made it five days, but I am really struggling with my resolve. I broke my arm and I can't do jackshit right now. All I want is a cart and I cant stop attempting to rationalize it - especially w this broken arm. 

I can't journal cause i'm right handed (lowkey typing this out is a chore, but I love playing typeracer and think I'm just mad I cant type fast w this dumb cast). I cant play mc or anything else cause the thickness of the cast and where it ends below my fingers makes it so I can't grip my mouse and it hurts to extend my arm ontop my desk idk why. I can't work cause I need to be able to preform cpr and obvs can't w a broken arm (also my doc said all I'm allowed to do is type - lame!) I can't crochet, I cant draw, I feel like I cant do anything. 

I mean I read (just finished book 6 of Dungeon crawler carl love them totally recommend), I've been going on walks and watching tv and stuff but w my income stopped as I can't work, and my dominate arm useless, I'm feeling kinda stuck/crazy. 

All I want is a cart and at the same time its also the last thing I want?? and I just don't know what to do with myself. I'm back in my childhood bedroom post grad, I live with my parents again, I've had a constant headache since I put the cart down for hopefully the last time on jan 1, I can't eat, can't sleep. And I know its all normal and part of the process, I have to let my brain chemicals balance out again. But holy moly I hate this. I have so many empty hours in these weeks ahead and all I can think about is getting another cart and I don't even want one! I just don't understand how I can want one so bad and also not at all. 

God I think maybe I just really want to be able to play minecraft and crochet and draw again. And its so easy to tell myself ""why are you trying to quit right now this would be perfect time to have your last ever cart"" but I know I'll just go through this insomnia and eating stuff again, which I don't want to do again as its currently sucking major booty rn. And if I did get another I'm scared I wouldn't try to quit again anytime soon, that I'd just get sucked right back into it. 

Anyways I feel better putting that into the universe, thanks for reading if ya did lol. I know a lot of people in here are struggling w quitting as well or lurking trying to decide if they should stop too (real that's what id been doing lol) and its quite nice knowing theres a collection of ppl who understand.

I cried everyday for 2 weeks, ate nothing, and it only ended because i caved and smoked. I guess today i mainly have some questions. 

Is is usually easier quitting after you’ve done it before?
I’ve got both the physical and the mental symptoms. Did you all struggle with these more, less, or the same on repeated attempts?

1q52xoe,Therapist's advice that actually worked for me and fears about the 4 month punch,"*First: I found this sub a few months ago, and I am so grateful. I can't believe how much I relate to everything being said here, and am really thankful for the insights and community. Especially big thanks to anyone who talked about the insane dizziness/vertigo thing that WILL go away but is scary as hell...you saved me from a big panic attack and stressful ER visits (mine went away in 3 weeks, but it was gnarly).* 

I'm one month sober tomorrow. 37 years old, smoking since I was 18ish (at first for fun, then the only way I could unwind, and then an absolutely consuming crutch and catch-all for dealing with anything in life). Now just having really vivid dreams, but gratefully, no other withdrawal symptoms.   
  
Something feels so different this time. Like a calm resolute feeling that I'm starting the rest of my sober life now, and I'm somehow totally at peace with it. This is a brand new sensation for me (I truly believed it would be a part of my life until the day I died and was kind of ok with that...it used to be my friend even if it hasn't been in a decade...). I want to share why I feel differently now, in case it helps anyone.   
  
I've been in therapy (EMDR/DBR) for 7 years now, since my partner died, and running away from the grief ramped up my usage in a huge way. Over the past two years, I've been clearer on how much I'm using as a means to disassociate/avoid feeling anything, and how much this is truly destroying every aspect of my life, but I still couldn't give it up. I've healed so many things in therapy, and I know I'm becoming a better and more regulated person, yet MJ's holding me hostage in this old version of myself. It's been so frustrating to know that intellectually and still not feel like I can walk away. My therapist has been stressing that bullying/shaming will not work, but I'm really phenomenal at those so I just couldn't listen. I only started hearing her in the last two years. Now, I have been taking her advice and it's (surprise) starting to work. These are the 3 major shifts that I have worked hard on in the past 2 years, which I think ultimately led to me deciding to give it up for good and feeling this surprising peace about it all:  
  
1) Radical compassion when I mess up. Every time I'd promise myself I wouldn't restock and I would, or every time ""just for sleep/just at parties"" turned quickly into all day every day use like clockwork, instead of berating myself/getting pissy and introverted because of the shame, I slowed it way down. Observed myself like a TV show: walking to the store, buying, going home, sliding into extremely heavy usage. Observed myself flaking on plans, choosing it over making work deadlines, giving into binge eating and binge watching behaviours. Observed myself being withdrawn and tired in social situations. I would just keep saying to myself: ""Man, I really am in pain, aren't I? I'm really not ok, am I? I must really be hurting if I keep doing this to myself, hey?"" I'd say/think these constantly, in the same tone I might say to a dear friend having a hard time: ""that's so hard, I'm so sorry you're going through that. I'm here for you, it will be okay."" Over the past two years (I know, I'm frustrated about how long it took, too, but I failed often and went back to bullying/shaming which stunted the progress), I slowly started to feel the bracing and threat levels in my body go way down. **I felt safer and less reactive. It was a huge nervous system shift that set the stage.**  
  
2) I gave up all my usual tactics of swinging from grandiose self esteem to massive loser syndrome depression and decided that I just had to meet myself where I'm at today and say I am loveable, I am okay, it's not that bad. This weight, this loneliness, this career dip. I don't like where I'm at right now at all, and I know it's all my fault, but it doesn't mean I'm trash, and I am still worthy of baseline care for myself. This was hard, and at first I felt like an idiot who was playing pretend, but everyone's right about how to do it: you just decide it's true. That's it. Not: ""it's true only when I behave like this or once I achieve this."" I still want to change so much about me/my life, I'm still actively building on healthy eating, exercise, career climbing, etc. I'm not at all stagnant. But I'm finally exhausted with giving myself conditional love, and finally done with being the meanest person (to me) that I've ever met. I'm just not a POS and I've decided to stop feeding the narrative that I am. **Now that my self respect isn't up for debate every minute of every day, the pressure is way down and I'm less reactive to bad feelings/bad social interactions/bad news.**  
  
3) Deciding I can, in fact, sit with hard feelings. I don't need to run away from them, even when my body is trying to convince me they're going to kill me if I don't get some relief or chase some instant dopamine. I can be in a bad mood. I can be sluggish. I can be sad. I can be lonely. I can be scared. I can be without instant pleasure or relief for an hour, a day, a few days. Thinking I couldn't sit with hard feelings \*and\* go about my day's tasks was the biggest trigger and justification for me relapsing: ""I just \*need\* relief. It's urgent, it's reasonable, it works and it's ok to reach for it."" **I got honest with myself that being sad/mad/tired/ashamed/insecure really sucks to feel but won't actually end me, and I started proving it to myself.**

I know I'm saying all this at only one month sober. This hopeful feeling is very green, it's true, but it's also very novel for me, and so it's standing out as meaningful data. I've taken breaks before, but I never said it was \*over.\* I knew it wasn't, I just told myself that it had gotten out of hand and so I needed to cool off. Then ""ok, now I can just for sleep or just at parties"" happens which of course quickly becomes all day, all consuming--rinse and repeat. But this time, I really feel it's over. And I'm shocked. Because no matter how bad it got (and it's gotten bad), I've never even thought I wanted sobriety/that sobriety was even possible for me until now, and it's showing me that these 3 shifts have possibly accumulated into impactful change.

The longest I've ever abstained has been 3 months, albeit not with the goal of lifelong sober, so I am very nervous about everything I'm learning about peoples' experiences re: the 4 month mark and the significant hardship it can bring. I will update this post in March. But I'm wondering if anyone has experiences to share about feeling okay until the 4 month punch/what you did when it happened? I feel so steady and stable and peaceful right now, but I know there will be hard times ahead.",1767658395.0,164,31,leaves,substance

1q52slb,Another Day 1,"really down on myself that i’m finding myself here again. Some background on me (can also be found on my prior posts): i’ve been a heavy heavy 1/8 a day flower smoker since atleast 2020. 24 years old, 6’0, 200lbs. last year i was forced to stop for a med school drug test. i went a little over 2 months without any thc and felt the best i had in years. i wasn’t as anxious or depressed, my appetite was the best it had been since puberty, i was social, truly everything was better. less than a week after i passed my test, i went on vacation with some heavy smokers and completely relapsed. when i got home i bought a new bong, an oz, and got right back to smoking all day everyday. i didn’t even love it when i was getting blasted those first few smokes. it was like i was on autopilot intentionally restarting my addiction for no reason at all. i’ll never understand my stupidity then. i justified my use for years by saying that i needed it to combat my anxiety/depression. then when i quit for 2 months, i discovered that weed was 100% the cause of this anxiety/depression. i just can’t believe i thought it would be different this time. i know now i can never smoke again, or atleast i surely can never own it. i know ill relapse again.

there’s lots of reasons for me to quit, but the main reason this time is so that i can finish medical school. as a heavy smoker last semester, i still got all As. the problem was, however, that i couldn’t do anything else. 100% of my energy was going in to school. i’m talking 140 hours a week being dedicated to school. never went to the gym, never cooked, hell i only ate like every other day or worse. i’m hopeful that quitting will help my memory and decrease the amount of hours i have to study. i’m hopeful ill gain some hours of free time by not feeling like i have to go straight home and smoke as soon as i hear the bell. and i’m hopeful some additional energy will keep my from burning out so fast this semester.

anyways, ill go ahead and log my withdrawal symptoms for day 1. appetite is zero. and i know tonight is going to suck and the next few days are going to be absolute hell. right now i’m just anxious for the fight to come and hoping it’s easier this go around. anyone else have experience quitting multiple times? this is my 3rd real attempt, can i expect this time to be a little easier?

1q50knv,Living with someone who smokes weed while I'm trying to quit.,"First off, I do not care that my roommate smokes weed, it is his body and his life. I just want to acknowledge the fact that it's been hard for me to quit while living with my friend who smokes weed and right now moving out isn't an option. It is always something we did together. I quit for a while before before relapsing and doing it everyday again. I am not putting this on my roommate because it is my own fault, I am the one who chose to smoke and he has been supportive of me in the past. 

The temptation is always there though because he sometimes leaves his stuff out and it's right there ready to use. I feel like quitting would be easier if there was no weed stuff in the house but I am not going to tell him to quit smoking weed just because I'm trying to quit. I recently took a good look at my life again and saw how much weed was negatively affecting me mentally and physically. 

This was reinforced by the fact that after I smoked a couple days ago I had some chest pain, like some tightness on my right side lung. It wasn't painful or hard to breathe, just felt tight when I breathed in and out. If it persisted though I was going to take myself to the ER. I feel better now but I took this as a sign that it's time to stop.

I need some support and help for me to stop smoking weed and be more productive with my life. I want to get more involved with my community, work out more, just have some real goals other than just sitting at home and smoking weed every free moment I got.

 I try to get my roommate out of the house to do stuff with me so we could have something more to bond over but he seems happy just staying in and smoking weed and playing video games. If he's happy that way, then I'm happy for him but I can't keep living this way.

1q4zchr,Not One Puff Ever! ❤️,"I started smoking 10 years ago when I was 16 (26 M). I smoked almost daily, and when I entered college my consumption skyrocketed ridiculously—basically everyone in my circle was using. Even though the pandemic was something very hard, for me it was like quitting cold turkey involuntarily lol, a new opportunity. I live outside the city, so there was no way for me to get any.

For two years I didn’t smoke even once and I used sports as a tool. I dedicated myself to bodybuilding and literally discovered and created a version of myself that I never imagined—or even believed—was possible.

In December 2021, I thought I deserved a joint as a reward. That joint turned into another joint the following weekend, and then it turned into a two-year relapse.

It may sound ridiculous, but I had a random epiphany while watching the final season of Stranger Things these past weeks, and it left me with a strange feeling I didn’t expect to hit this hard.

I started watching the show when I was 16, and now I’m 26. Seeing the characters grow up, close their stories, and say goodbye to that universe made me realize something very simple yet heavy: time passes, it changes us, and it doesn’t stop to process things alongside us.

Now, being aware of this, I told myself… I CANNOT ALLOW my happiness to depend on a substance, and I no longer want time to make me pay the price.

I’ve managed to accept that I can’t negotiate with substances.

This is my 3rd day sober—this time, forever. I decided to spend the first few days with my brother. Today, Monday, I came back home after work and all my weed was waiting for me… You know what I did? I flushed it all down the toilet. It was incredibly liberating, and I feel proud of myself. I’m very happy because, in my previous experience, this is always the hardest step—and I did it. This time, for good.

I’m sharing this as a way to say thank you for having found this group, for the peace that comes from knowing you’re not alone, and the reassurance you get from reading all the support.

…I shared my story for anyone who feels it’s impossible to get back up after falling. If you read this far, thank you.

1q4yrvs,8 weeks sober - my story so far,"Been trying to quit for years now. Finally found a good reason as I was able to connect my use to my negative performance at work. Took a couple 2-3 month breaks in the last 2-3 years but never stuck. For the last year I've only been using on weekends, but even that was having a negative impact.

Went cold turkey 8 weeks ago. Didn't notice a huge change right away, just subtle things like more presence, less anxiety, waking up with less fog.

Things were also complicated by my unhealthy relationship with sugar and carbs. Have been keto since September but the Christmas break with all its sugar was difficult. Made it through that and now finally starting to see what life is like completely sober and under 20g of carbs per day.

Another factor is I've been meditating and doing yoga for 20 years. I've plateaued with the yoga for a long time and I'm now realizing the sugar and weed were causing inflammation that was making it impossible to go deeper. Now that they're gone I've gone through what I can only describe as an awakening--one of the sickest I've been in years. Chest/throat/sinus congestion and been on my ass for a week. Many times when I was feeling this way I wanted to reach for the weed and realized it was probably distracting me from feeling this stuff.

Anyway. The change I've appreciated the most is being able to enjoy long-form content. Movies, YouTube, podcasts. Couldn't enjoy that stuff while high because I'd get in my own head. Will be getting back into reading here soon I'm sure too.

Weed was holding me back for a decade. Not sure how I didn't piece that together but I guess it was the fear of facing this last piece of discomfort. Not sure I'll ever smoke again. Happy I can start to build myself and actually talk to people about things I've consumed rather than just garbage short-form doomscrolling.

1q4ybu2,I want to quit smoking for better health,"For some context: I'm a 26yo 220lb gal who's been smoking cannabis daily for 5+ years. My dad, brother as well as every adult on my dad's side of the family smokes cigarettes. So it's a common addiction between us all. Now, ever since I was 19 I've had enlarged veins on my right leg and have finally come to the realization that I should quit smoking. As the combustion from smoking is known to damage blood vessels and exacerbate certain health related issues. I'm also working on my reducing my weight as well and exercise.

So, everytime that I've taking a break from cannabis in the past; was purely from running out of flower. But I always end up with more and continue smoking 3+ times a day. I want to quite this unhealthy habit and eventually move away from cannabis entirely. It'll help with my lungs, veins, and mental health. How should I go about letting my medical license lapse, and actually quit cannabis smoking? ",1767647709.0,2,1,leaves,substance

Second time detoxing from weed. I've detoxed from alcohol and nicotine in the past as well, but this is probably one of the worst detoxes I have gone through. Currently about a week in. I had some low dose carts on night 2 to help me sleep. Since then I have not touched any.

I was a chronic user: not long, less than a year. I was vaping really high concentrations and would need nearly 4 blinkers to feel something. Eventually I had enough and wanted to quit. My anxiety was getting worse. My sleep was getting worse. I was depressed.

Now, I am off. My anxiety is unbearable. I dropped 4 pounds this week. I know I need to ride it out, but I don't know how long I can do this. I don't know how long I'm going to expect to go through this. It's awful.

1q4vfit,"Goodbye, MJ","Dear Weed,

From the day we met, you have played an important role in my life. You introduced me to lifelong friends. You’ve picked me up when I’ve been beaten down. You put a smile on my face when all I felt was a frown.

Most recently, you helped me through a time in my life where I felt totally alone and afraid. You kept me going when everything around me was shit. You’ve played an important role in me getting back on my feet and feeling alive once more.

But I’ve overstayed my welcome. I’ve taken your hospitality for granted; abused the comfort you offered me. Your support has become a crutch – a habit. For me to continue my journey, for me to properly heal, I must face that which I hide from in your embrace.

Thank you for lending me your courage, your joy, and your lovely fuzziness. But the time has come for me to let it go, to relinquish the love I have for you and to place it where I know you’d want it to go: to me.

This is going to be hard. It’s definitely going to hurt me more than it hurts you, being a plant and all. But I know this path. It’s a tough one to walk, it’s one part of me wants to run and hide from. Yet it’s the path to progress, to change, to creating the life I fantasise about while giggling with you on the sofa.

I will make you proud. I will take the peace you’ve shown me into the world, I’ll put our creativity to use making things around me better, and I’ll draw on the courage you’ve taught me to make my life as meaningful as I possibly can. I’ll re-engage with the world, leaving behind our cozy chamber, and turn the pain I feel at your loss into strength which propels me forward.

Maybe one day we can meet again. One day when I can treat you right. But today is not that day, and I must meet the challenge of today to build the tomorrow I want to see.

Thank you for walking beside me all these years. I’ve got it from here.

All my love,

El Spanberger ",1767641363.0,3,2,leaves,substance

I've been lurking in this sub for a couple of months, reading all of your stories. All of the reasons not to quit that you guys have overcome were all too familiar. All of your reasons to quit became mine too. I have never wanted help in quitting my addiction because I thought it would mean 12 steps and quasi religious bs.

I also take some anxiety medication that helps me reduce my heart beat, so so far I haven’t been too anxious in the mornings and I’ve been working out a lot to help me get exhausted and rest better at night.

However, in 1 week time I have accepted to go on a date. The plan is to go out for a couple of drinks, and I don’t think I’ll be having more than 2-3 alcoholic beverages. But now I’m wondering… given the timings, will this be a bad idea? I don’t drink unless is a date or I’m out with friends, so I haven’t had alcohol in my system since I decided to quit.

So I have been battling PTSD, anxiety, survivors remorse, etc, for years now which started at 17. Especially with other small events that occurred in life over the same years also. I quit smoking last May up until July 4th. A lot of my peers say they “see something good in me if I stay disciplined and get back sober”. I can admit have been smoking way more than usual sadly. Some of the tactics I used to stop smoking aren’t working this time. Regardless of that, I have been praying more and so hard to God. Actually trying to live the right way and understand his word. The good thing about life is you can fail 100 times at something, try 1 more time and can still get it right. Another thing to add to that is Faith without work is dead. I know the withdrawals are intense but if I got through them once, I can do it again. I am not looking for any sympathy whatsoever, just came to share because this community will most def make you feel like you have a couple of listening ears and people who are also going through similar things as me. I know I’m young still but I’m here to say please don’t give up and always pray! I have faith it’s light at the end of the tunnel!",1767605650.0,2,4,leaves,substance
1q4fwz2,How I quit weed the last few times.,"I am a 32 years old male and have a serious cannabis use disorder. I even leave the country 2 months sometimes to quit. When I come back from outside the country, I start getting cravings for weed again. Every craving is longer and more intense than before. Some people are successful and graduate from university while using weed and drugs but not me. I feel like a complete failure in school and life in general.

How I quit weed was first praying to God every day, and then finding and creating techniques to quit for example attending online Marijuana Anonymous Meetings, tapering, finding ideas and techniques on r/leaves. I am now trying to help people on reddit. I hope to not relapse again. I know the cravings will come back again and long and intense ones even in the long term. ",1767600193.0,10,3,leaves,substance
1q4cc5c,What's the difference (in benefits) between time duration with relapse vs no relapse?,"About a month ago I had been 110 days since I had ""given up"" weed i.e I just chose to not OWN it myself since I have no self-control over it. The only people I knew who did smoke where people I didn't see very often so I kinda just thought of this as quitting. Long story short I ended up smoking a total of 10 times in that time period, where the longest consecutive break was 30 days. 

But I noticed that I was really sad and full of urges the days following where I smoked so I just decided to give it up completely and it's been 30 days since doing this! 

  
I've just been curious as to what extent the benefits of sobriety have been stunted due to the times I did smoke on occasion? While I'm super proud of myself for smoking that little of an amount in that time, I don't feel like I'm as clear-headed and happy etc... as others who are 100% sober at this point? I guess part of me hopes that I'm not at those benefits yet because I'm stuck thinking, ""is this it?"" 

  
In other words, what's the difference between someone who smoked 10 times (averages out to once every 2 weeks) vs someone who didn't relapse once within 4.5 months?

I’ve been eating clean. Taking in only good things. Struggling to quit smoking cigs, that feels like the main goal now and when I try, it’s like I have no buffer for all the big feelings. And have a hard time with nothing to “reach” for. 

I get the feeling that will be harder, and it’s keeping me from embracing life and getting my go button going.

The physical withdrawal effects honestly weren’t that bad and went away after a week or two. But the depression and sense of helplessness that followed has been horrific. I’m a person who has struggled with anxiety and depression in the past, so I know I may be more prone to this than others. But it’s getting to a point where I’m struggling cognitively. I feel like a heavy blanket is constantly covering my brain, and at the slightest inconvenience or piece of bad news I just shut down. It’s freaking me out and I don’t know what to do. It’s like the depression is making me dumber. 

I’ve seen people on here say it can take multiple months before things go back to “normal”, so I’m holding out for that. But I feel so insecure and uncertain.

I’ve been vaping cannabis and edibles nearly daily for the last four years. Postpartum depression and COVID honestly wrecked me mentally and cannabis was the life raft. But I’ve been discovering it’s no longer the safe life raft I thought.

I am function able. I had boundaries around it like never smoked while working, only at night. But it was daily. I looked forward to it every night. It was my way of escaping, turning off my inner narrator (I was also diagnosed with ADHD early last year). But over the last six months, I’ve noticed an increase in anxiety and paranoia. Even as soon as last week, I went three days without and I took one hit. Literally one. I felt so sick mentally and physically. My speech was rapid, I felt anxious and on edge and nauseated. I literally vowed if I got through it, I wouldn’t do it again. And here I am. Day 5. 
The cravings hit around 5pm-6:30pm, which was typically the time I had my first hit. I feel myself being on edge and the anxiety creeping up . I hate it.

1q4b5wd,Day 47 - I can't wait to see myself in a year,"I have gone through withdrawal a few times now - and I am so determined this is the last. I'm at Day 47 and remembering that the two times in the past 15 years I went without smoking for over a year (1 yr and 2 months, and 1 yr and 4 months) were some of the best times in my life. I accept that I relapsed a few times, and I am going to keep fighting.

I have been working on being more honest with myself. And to notice more when I am getting overloaded with stress (especially recurring stressors, or having multiple) and am letting go of my standard ways to cope with stress. These are the times I have relapsed.

Life without weed is SO much better. I am able to 

* See myself more clearly and be honest with myself 
   * This is HARD in early recovery, because I have to face what triggers led me to smoke in the first place and realize and face the healthier habits I have let go of. It is still so worth it.
* Care for myself better in so many ways. As I recover I have began to
   * exercise and walk more
   * Eat healthier - and not binge eat when stoned
   * Show up for my friendships and relationship more
   * Keep my home more tidy and cleaner
   * Be SO much more responsible with my money
* Live in much more alignment with my values
* Experience a wider range of emotions
   * Remember, we cannot selectively numb emotions. So when I was smoking, I was numbing pain, but also joy. 

There is so much more to write here, but this feels like enough for now.

I am making plans with my partner to celebrate near or on day 90 - as research shows THC can stay in your system for 80-90 days. And also I cannot wait to meet myself again when I haven't smoked for one year.   
  
And meet myself for the first time ever (in the past 13 years - by then it will be 15 years) going a full 2 years without smoking. I can't imagine how stable I will be and the things I will have done.

And then I'll see myself five years out, 10 years out, and more. I smoked for the first time in 2012 and quit (this time) for the last time in 2025, so after smoking for 13 years, it will be insane to see my life 13 years out from that, without smoking. 

I hope this brings some of you joy - especially when times are tough - thinking not only what your life can be in a few months - but what it can be years down the road of not smoking.",1767584965.0,5,2,leaves,substance
1q4a1h1,Painful cycle of quitting,":(

Don’t feel obligated to give advice or anything, I am  putting this into the world because I hide my addiction from everyone I know. And that’s really what it is, I’m addicted to weed… I’m addicted to being high, to feeling smoke fill my lungs and to forgetting everything that actually matters. I hate myself for becoming this way, truly.

I’m 21 years old, I first smoked when I was 17 after my stepdad encouraged me to help cope with major depression/suicidality. At 18, my mom died and I spent countless months abusing carts/weed to forget about it. Now, I wish I never ever agreed, I wish my mom had forbid him at the time, I wish I was still someone who could say they have never smoked/drank :( and it hurts to know I can never go back. I’ve tried quitting multiple times and today I have reached Day 1 for what feels like the millionth time. 

When I’m high, I’m always browsing this subreddit, when I’m sober, I’m browsing this. I know in my heart I want to quit, I want control over my life and myself fully again, but it is so so so HARD. I’ve tried the trap of moderate use but at the end of the day, I am confident I’ll be an addict again. That’s who I am, that’s what I’ll always do if I partake again, and I wish so badly it wasn’t like this. I’m putting this into the world to finally be honest. I’m an addict who hides it well, and I do not want to be this way forever. I want to spend my 20s building someone I can be proud of… spend my 20s doing things I’ll remember forever, and being there for the family I still have left. They deserve me sober and present, not running from everything all the time.

I've had some fairly traumatic events over the past few years, and that has always been my justification for being soft on my smoking habits. 

I've noticed how isolated I've become recently, and how weed furthers that cycle. I've come to the point that I no longer have any toxic people in my life and it's become clear... I'm now just running old patterns. 

I'm stunting my growth potential every time I smoke purely out of habit. I'm deliberately dulling my light. 

It seems so simple in one sense : everything in my life levels up when I don't smoke. But in the moments I feel lonely, smoking becomes my friend, and further isolates me. 

I've decided I need to step through the emotional fire, and start with a month. The Warrior archetype feels helpful right now, knowing that I need to go through hell before I find some sort of heaven again.

I've been self employed doing landscaping for 10 years, I have a wife, 18 month old daughter and another daughter due in 2 months. I'm doing alright by most standards, but the list of reasons I want to quit has been growing longer every year. I've tried quitting several times over the last 5 years but I never make it past a few days. I start sweating profusely all the time, not just at night, my stomach aches, bad gas, no appetite, headaches, can't sleep, vivid nightmares when I do sleep that mess me up for hours and I'm very unpleasant to be around... I'm a complete mess every time I've tried to quit, so it's always just seemed not worth it. I can't work under those conditions, it's just not safe to be on a ladder when I haven’t slept in days.

I caved and ordered some weed last night to be delivered today. Felt so disappointed in myself this morning. I cancelled the order as the delivery was about to go out.

1q47g3i,My life journey with weed period 2023-2026.,"I am not that good at english but took time to write this. Please sorry for grammar mistakes. 
I am writing this for myself & my reflection on weed.hope it will help u guys .
Jan 1,2023,3 years ago my friend introduced me into weed at first I used to smoke once a day like everyday 
In this time I was in a relationship with a girl who I met in online game .
Everyday was so good & lovely. I am introvert but after smoking weed & i notice I talk to strangers very good 
I feel I am travelling in space seeing different kind of colours & energy’s & feelings 
I am full positive on weed this time & I recommend to many of my friends I say them it’s a super natural power every person should try once In A life
I told them so many benefits every my friend joined me 
They smoke occasionally tho but me daily once 
Only bad thing I know about weed in this period is it’s made me lazy like it’s continued 1 year 
I didn’t worked just in vibe all year 
On jan 2024 new year I got to know 
The girl I was in relationship is married & had a daughter it was so heartbreaking moment in my life 
Like I loved alot alot in end everything is false I took many days to cry & I am so down 
I took some break from weed & started working 
Like 7 months full work may be smoked 2-3 times in 7 months so only I missed 2-3 days of work 

This period made me comeback I cleared my debts & got some savings.

On July 2024 my birthday I started smoking with friends & took few days for weed 3 sessions a day like 3 joints 
Then I went into online game while doing sessions & I met another girl I was in talk with her 1 month she is the girl what I dreamt of from child. I believed she is best for me. Month later she revealed she is married & wanted to get divorce because husband cheated her on health it’s been 2 months since her marriage 
Idk that time I had a big trauma with my past relationship, I was quiet 2 days & said I am with u don’t worry 
Do what u need life take divorce if u r really fighting for ur life I wil be there fr u 
Our relationship started she is fighting for divorce she used to chat with me everyday 
She send chats of her husbands & everything toxic in her relationship 
I don’t know what to answer so for that sake I smoked weed again 
Like everyday with 4-5 sessions with bong more powerful then joint. 
It’s continued till 2 months & this period I started noticing I losing my memory power & connection with myself & whole brain is fog 
So I explained everything with her my issues & I took break 
This break I took because of fog & memory loss & getting connection lost with myself 
Like I used to talk good with her only while smoking weed when I am off I don’t remember anything damn 
4 months no cigarettes & no weed only work it went so good 
On 2025 jan 1 I started again getting into weed 
This period I know it’s have many useful benefits & side effects 
If I need to deep think any subject I smoke weed like I tune my brain while smoking weed 
In march 2025 her family caught us, they warned me they scolded my family many things 
I used to take all calls of her family while smoking only weed because I believed it’s only can make me talk better with anyone
In end everything messed up my family’s don’t agreed with me & she ghosted me online completely 
This time I don’t have nothing to think 
When I smoke weed I was getting sleep because my mind is empty after she left me 
Every time I smoke I get sleep so bad 
So it’s useless smoking 
I took break 
This break I believed i was god & i can do anything possible 

THIS IS MY BIGGEST COMEBACK EVER 
MARCH 2025 - JULY 2025 

I started physical exercise, daily 1 hr walking , daily journalising my thought & making them clean , good diet 
Made a system running with my friends to generate money it’s my life turned life is so joyefull like never before 
I reached what I manifested in this period . 
Then on my birthday JULY 2025 my friends celebrated, i have zero emotions & feelings 
I didn’t get this point that time & I thought to get my feelings & emotions back I need weed 
So started smoking still no real feelings only horny feels sometimes 
Then I decided I should see her once because she ghosted me from 5 months 
May be I get feelings back if I see her really from far 
Started travelling to her place like 700 kms from my home, I am on 120 speed . while driving a drunk old man came on highway 
He died on spot i am so sensitive still I haven’t got single emotion or feeling killing a guy accidentally 
Like I am so lost 
Idk what’s going with my life that time from that period to this period I smoked like hella hella 

SMOKED LIKE A KG WEED IN THIS AUG,SEP,OCT,NOV 
Nonstop whole day & huge & huge amount no one ever smoked in life 
Like I achieved what I manifested when I am off weed 
When I am on weed I lost my girl & I kill a guy & I did many horny things & I lost my emotions & feelings everything 
& In December 2025  
I realised on my birthday I lost my emotions & feelings because of heavy load work & no sleep 
It’s not because of weed. I misunderstood it 
If I took break & make tune journalise things everything gonna make better 
It’s worked me for eveytime. 
2026 Jan1 - Jan 5 it’s been 5 days I been off from weed 
My brain is getting memory back I can write something I can think I can focus on something now 
It’s not my brain full potential I know 
I wanted to achieve 100% potential of my brain this year 

I KNOW REAL POWER IS OUR BRAIN DONT LET ANT OTHER THING CONTROL IT 
NIETHER ITS WEED,ANYTHING,PERSON OR SOCIAL MEDIA 

Anyone can comeback from weed 
I learned some good points on weed & 100 offs negative things on weed 
Still I smoked a lot in Nov,dec 
I still can’t stop it just because I need practice 
practice to control it 
Practicing leaving it only we can leave it 
If it ever off comes into my mind I just take control of my brain & journalise some points 
I let my brain handle everything calmly 
Practice practice 
I know this time till my life death I never gonna smoke weed again in any situation 
Rn I am writing down diary I am getting my emotion too back a little 
It will take time I gonna achieve what I am dreaming off 
Just give work to ur brain guys 
Put yourself reset modes if u lost in weed thoughts or any thoughts like shaking legs to get back into focus 
Or focusing at eye make us get back reset mode & journalise 2 min & practise 
Main thing cut of weed friends till u believe on u. 
Make busy in new things do slowly & calmly no hurry in anything pls 
Never compare with others compare with urself 
I just journalise my day in my diary everyday in past 5 days it’s helping me lot to tune my brain 
To get my energy back I need to physical execrcices & maintain good diet 
I walk few minutes a day listening sina bathea music makes me feel good 
Yah I am on good track I am gonna achieve my dreams in 2026 
U can do it keep staying away from weed practice & control ur brain 
Anyone can do wonders it’s the biggest asset god gifted us.

1q4770o,Being able to feel overwhelmed again feels really ****ing good.,"I went from weekends-only to daily edibles about two years ago, and it numbed me out in a way that I told myself was fun.

I have ADHD, my brain is a very loud place, to the point where I had ""is it ADHD or Schizophrenia"" thoughts at various points in my life. Being able to turn that volume down felt like control.

I still, to this day, absolutely love thinking no thoughts. But I don't want to think no thoughts if it comes along with feeling no feelings.

I've used weed drastically less since early December, and haven't touched it since 12/28. 

I also have been taking estrogen for about 3 months, and the first two were kinda like ""this e aint shit"" even though I could see my lab levels and see that my estrogen was in a good space.

Between the estrogen, and ""only"" being a chronic, heavy user for 2ish years, my emotions are coming back way sooner than I anticipated. I've seen recovery videos that told me not to expect emotional highs/lows for months, but I have been FEELING feelings lately.

Sometimes it feels like PMSing. Sometimes it feels sad, happy, scared, ambitious. But I don't know, right now I'll take it all.

I think I've cried every day since I quit. Mostly happy cries, doubled over knee-slapping while watching a standup comedian just _crush_ their set. But some sad cries too. Some walk-by-the-lake-and-think-about-life cries.

And you know what? I'll take it all.

1q40jum,10 Years In & Five Weeks Out (The Detox Arc),"After ten years of smoking weed as a way to numb and escape from the challenges that life presented, I've finally wandered out of the haze that I once found comforting these past couple of weeks to take life head-on without depending on Mary Jane whenever things got tough. Admittedly, it hasn't been easy, but the positives of this journey greatly outweigh the negatives, so I'm going to keep moving forward until I truly feel free of the haze.

To think it all began as a way to escape and help me sleep back when I worked a shitty hospital job where the work environment was toxic and hostile. I would get home, dab until I couldn't feel anything, and pass out, then repeat this cycle for nearly five years. Even though I made some great friends and memories with these individuals during this time, I'm realizing now that I wasn't truly present for the majority of it. I was also running away from the fact that I hated this job and was numbing the fact I was burnt out from it. 

I did eventually move on from that job, finally finished college, and found myself in a relationship with a partner who accepted my stoner tendencies over the next five years. At a certain point, my partner found that my substance abuse with weed might have stemmed from ADHD, which I had thought was depression or anxiety for most of my life. After taking tests and getting medical support, it was true. I definitely have ADHD, and I abused weed as a substance that I thought helped me manage these aspects of myself. Even with this diagnosis and a supportive partner, I still couldn't break the habit, no matter what I did, whether it was transitioning to weekend-only usage or changing the type of weed (flower, edibles, etc.)...I knew that I would just waste my time away in the haze. 

The cycle repeated itself recently as I found myself in another line of work I hated and really drained me of my energy most days. However, I found a new hobby that was a callback to a childhood extracurricular activity of mine, and became insanely obsessed with it, which was boxing, of all things. Since the sport calls for a high level of cardio, I realized that smoking was holding back my ""gas tank"" and lung capacity, so I finally called it quits for that reason, alongside wanting to be present for my relationship, friendships, and being the best version of myself possible. 

These past five weeks have been a bit of a rollercoaster. My sleep hasn't quite stabilized, but around the third week, I was having dreams again. They were vivid as fuck. There was one in particular that stood out where I was confronting myself and making amends with the fact that it was ok that I was using Mary Jane to numb those years I felt like I could've been a better student, musician, boxer, and boyfriend because I didn't know any better since all I knew was smoke my worries, fears, and anxieties away in the haze. I remember my partner waking me up from that dream because my breathing was frantic, and I had tears in my eyes from the vividness of it. Since then, I've gotten better at managing my emotions, and the brain fog has been slowly disappearing. I feel much more present and have been more consistent in my communication with loved ones, friends, and co-workers. 

For the first time in a long time, I feel hopeful about the future rather than hazy and anxious about the what-ifs. I occasionally get the urge to escape or become extremely irritable from not having Mary Jane to numb the pain, but I have a hobby that requires a level of discipline to refrain from doing so, and I really take the time to remind myself of the positives of staying away from the haze. 

This community has been a godsend whenever it's gotten tough, and I am wishing everyone all the best with their journeys. I'll be back with an update within time.

I really thought I would cave yesterday.  It was so hard.  It felt like I was gripping on to the world with my fingertips.  

I read something about quitting weed that asked to think about why I started smoking.  At first it was a fun thing on a Friday night but it quickly became every day, all day because it made me forget my mental pain.  Thinking some more I know it was because of the (what I perceived as) fracture I felt with my first born.  I had severe postpartum depression to the point I was hospitalized for a month when he was six months old.  It just broke me that I had to leave him.  He was fine of course with his dad, it was me as a first time mother thinking if I left him he would forget me, which of course he didn’t.  I first smoked weed a few weeks after I was released, for fun with the girls.

I really liked that it blunted my emotions and calmed me down.  It just became something I wanted to keep having, ignoring everything I should have been dealing with.  I’ve been hospitalized a few times since then.  A lot of this was because I couldn’t deal with the emotions I felt after my family had disowned me because I let it be known that my dad had interfered with me.  Of course I wasn’t believed and was ousted from the family.  I see none of them and haven’t for the last 15 years.  More weed to the rescue!

Last night I started feeling a lot of these feelings.  I tried mindful meditation to just sit with all the emotions, but it was too much, too painful.  Remembering the split from my family feels like it happened yesterday.  How do I like myself when I’ve upset people to the point that they no longer want me in the family?  I’ve been sobbing and having dark thoughts.  I just want weed to make it blunted again.

But I can’t because I’ve said I’m no longer a smoker.  Over the span of 30 years I’ve met many a therapist and I only connected with one of them and I saw her until she retired a couple of years ago.  I loathe looking for therapists.

Since I live with a rare illness, I rarely leave the house.  When I left work bit by bit all of my friends dropped away as I was being diagnosed and treated.  I wasn’t able to go to many things and they just drifted off.

I have no bloody clue how to re enter life again.  I’m sick and don’t drive.  Might just be time to say goodbye to it all.

1q3vdg4,22 days sober,"I’ve been smoking for \~20 years, daily. I had a 1-year break around 2016, then started again and basically doubled my intake to \~3–5g/day. Two years ago I moved country and switched to hash. My use also changed from “nightly” to all day, every day, and the frequency went way up.

About a year ago my partner got pregnant. I promised myself (and her) so many times I’d stop, but I just couldn’t.

Then \~3 months ago I got really sick — asthma issues that rolled into flu/bronchitis. 22 days ago I quit cold turkey (no taper, no replacements).

The flu was so rough that it basically masked the first 10 days of withdrawal. I was even telling my partner “this isn’t so bad.”

Once the flu eased up (around day \~14), the withdrawals hit hard. And I’ll be honest: it’s been genuine hell.

Pattern:

Mornings are “okay-ish” (groggy because sleep is bad). But the serious physical withdrawal kicks in around 2–3pm and lasts into the evening.

My nervous system goes into overdrive: I get painful shakes, rib ache, whole-body aches. During this window I just want to curl into a ball and wait for it to pass.

Then around 19:00, it flips: my body shifts into overheating, especially my core. I usually just stay in bed at that point.

Sleep:

I can fall asleep “okay,” but about 1 hour after falling asleep the sweats start. They’re not soaking the bed, but enough to make me/my pillow damp and gross.

I wake every 2–3 hours from extremely vivid dreams. The dreams are intense and take me to places/people I’d rather not visit. When I wake up, my body feels like it’s trying to “reconcile” the dream world with reality, and it causes a lot of physical discomfort and frustration. Then I get up, pee, drink water, try again… repeat.

This cycle is why mornings are so groggy.

Appetite / food:

My appetite is completely screwed. I’ve cut almost all sugar and processed foods, and eating is so difficult that soup and yogurt are basically all I can tolerate. Even foods I normally love, I currently hate. I’ve lost 10+ kg (some of that is obviously from the stacked sickness), but the withdrawal has almost entirely removed my appetite other than certain windows — morning, early lunch, and sometimes after 9pm (even then I often feel like I’ll vomit).

Cravings:

Honestly, cravings are basically non-existent. I think that phase got absorbed into the 10 days of flu. And now that I’m experiencing how brutal the physical withdrawal is, I have zero desire to reset the clock and go through it again. 22 days is too far in.

So yeah — I’m just pushing forward.

Im so alone and no one could ever understand how this stupid drug is sooo addictive. I even sought out treatment and it’s a joke. My therapist suggests i try switching my habit with something else… but i have tried that about 50 times over the past 20 years. Then she suggested i take medication to quit. I said ‘that exists?’ And she said ‘ well for more sever drugs so maybe cannabis too’.  She doesn’t even know, my addictions councillor. 

How do you quit when it’s what makes you happy? I’m very bored, stressed, and anxious with the state of the world, so how do you stop using the only thing that makes you happy? (Probably also what is making me feel so depressed now).

1q3p821,"Day 94 — for the first time in my life, I feel like I’m finally over it","I’m a 42-year-old male from Germany. I smoked, with breaks, for 29 years.
I quit weed for the thousandth time on 01/10/2025. 

The first two months were easy, but at the beginning of December the cravings started and I think PAWS hit hard. Everything felt pointless, gray, and not enjoyable, with anhedonia straight out of hell.
I literally just went to work, sat on my couch watching TV, ate, slept, and repeated.

My addicted brain tried hard to convince me to smoke. I truly believed I would never enjoy life without weed again. What helped me keep going was reminding myself every day why I quit in the first place:

-I don’t want to plan my day around weed anymore.

-I don’t want to lose interest in everything except getting high.

-I want to be present for my family and not sit for hours every day on my balcony.

-I don’t want to only be able to eat when I’m high.

-I also struggle with anxiety and depression, and I’m on medication for it.

-I don’t want to numb my feelings and emotions; I want to learn to experience both the good and the bad ones.

-I don’t want this mind-fuck circle of relapsing and withdrawal anymore.

 I’ve been trying to quit since 11/09/2023 with countless relapses. It’s more exhausting than being high every day.
These 94 days are the farthest I’ve come in years.

Like I said, I believed it would never get better — but first there were minutes of joy, then hours, then more hours, and now hopefully days.

Recently I watched Steel Rain on Netflix and completely forgot about weed because I enjoyed it so much. Then I realized that with weed I didnt enjoyed a movie like this for years. I would just get high, watch some random nonsense I’d forget anyway, get tired, and sleep.


So if you’re struggling: keep going. Distract yourself. Read this sub up and down. Reach out for help. It will get better.

Many ex-smokers experience PAWS around 2–3 months after quitting. Even though the physical withdrawal is over, waves of depression, anxiety, cravings, and emptiness can return. This is very common and temporary — it comes in waves and it does pass.

If I can do it, so can you. Weed used to be my life and identity — now I look back with disgust, shame and a little bit wiser. ",1767531151.0,3,1,leaves,substance

Aside from the isolation, I usually prefer to stay home when I'm high. The problem started when I began wanting to be high all the time.

I feel that, at the same time that I numb myself from feeling many things, I also numb myself from experiencing many things.

1q3nlmz,4th day off quit Dec 31st crazy anxiety,"hey people of the marijuana world, i am 18 and currently in a world of anxiety. i have smoked thc vapes on and off for about 2 years and i wish i never did. I have re picked up the use the last 3 months (as u can see its a cycle of sobriety and non sobriety for me) this month has by for been my most abusive month, on dec 31st i hit my near dead vape 4g vape which i only had for like a week and a half i had an insane rush of anxiety like i was gonna fuckin die. 

Now on day 4 i can finally say i feel a bit better, anxiety is dreadful but it comes in waves but more manageable, i can finally eat food and not hate it, just the smell of food made me gag brushing my teeth also made me projectile vomit, but i definitely am still lacking hunger queues and cant eat large amounts, food helps calm the jitters from the anxiety a bit, i havent tried it but i can imagine any sort of stimulant would fucking suck so stay away from caffeine etc. sleep is a fucking bummer, i have slept like 6 hrs since the 31st today is the 4th the anxiety mixed with the insomnia stop me from sleeping but last night was a little bit better. overall my main takeaway is if u are feeling crazy thats alright because i feel fucking insane but atleast its going away slowly but surely, i bet once i get a couple days of some sleep i’ll feel better.

my main support systems right now would be my mother, my girlfriend, and marijuana anonymous zoom meetings( these are at all times of the date, just google MA zooms meetings and there is a website that gives u zooms at all hours of the day) these meetings gave me some hope as actually being able to speak to people who are also suffering  makes me feel better about my experience because it gives me confirmation that im not the only anxious whirlwind in the world. the people in the calls are immensely supportive too, for instance alot of them give out their personal cell numbers for people to contact them if they need a pick me up or just  somebody to listen for a moment. my mother and girlfriend have been IMMENSELY helpful, all the others times i had been dealing with marijuana withdrawals or had been suffering i had always internalized it only ever telling my gf or some friends, this time around i was so bummed that i wanted to feel love from my mother i wished for tenderness, and i am so fortunate that she listened with an open heart bc these first few days would have been so much harder without her. 

My main point is we all feel terrible right now (if ur reading this going through withdrawals or cravings), i cannot WAIT to be a month sober but before that 5 days and then week, and even then sometimes we can only deal with it an hour a minute or a second at a time, i have spent so much time reading submissions here looking for the magic solution to my body’s detoxing, it aint out there, time heals all, stay hydrated and try and eat if u csnt. and i just wanna say lean on the people who care about you and stay busy do stuff you dont normally do, go on walks ALOT of them. 

i’ll probably keep posting as it helps keep me grounded in reality when i get super anxious and worried about my mental health ( i dont have any diagnosed preexisting mental conditions, im just worried as to what ive done to myself) as a result of the withdrawals, so anybody struggling day to day will probably see me post again tomorrow and maybe that’ll give u guys a timeline even though we arent all the same.

1q3nim8,Day 3 quitting smoking while pregnant,"I need some encouragment to stay sober. Before i got pregnant i quit smoking cigarettes, it was tough but I made it through and dont miss it. But I think it was easier due to the fact that I was still smoking weed which helped with the smoking cessation. I seem to have quite an addiction to the hand to mouth movement and blowing out smoke, a bit more then getting high. But I do also have fibromyalgia and anxiety so the weed has helped with that too. I have felt for some time that I want to quit. I do not get the benefits I used to get, and I think it has made my anxiety and sleep quality worse.

But the main reason for my post, I am currently 27 weeks pregnant with a baby boy. I have been feeling guilty for all 27 weeks, but my brain seems to confince me that smoking is better: ""being high is safer then being anxious, or having a lack of sleep"", ""many moms have smoked throughout pregnancy and had perfectly healthy babies"" etc. Also if you go digging you will find research saying its not bad for you or your growing baby. Which further more encouraged me to continue. But I am at a point where I am tired of being a slave to weed, especially the embarassment of smoking while pregnant, so I need to do it secretly like a child. And also my partner who doesnt smoke needs to buy my supply. But the biggest reason, I want to quit for the health of myself and mt baby. I have many more reasons to want to quit and as many to continue. I have tried a few times to quit now but unsuccessfully. 

I am on day 3 of quitting today and need some encouragment to stick with it while pregnant but also after giving birth. I want to be done with all types of smoking and finally break the addiction. So far not alot of physical withdrawel, but more mental. 

How did you get through the mental withdrawel? When did the physicql symptoma hit you hardest and how did you deal with it? What has been the greatest benefit for you quitting?

1q3nikw,78 days clean,"I've smoked for13 years, only in the evening.

That lead to mini withdrawal every day. 

The consequences of this were: Irritability, anger, impulsiveness, paranoia, cravings starting with early afternoon

  
The other side effects were of course: brain fog, broken memory, zero motivation or drive, emotional chaos, insane inner dialogs, inner arguments about the most stupid things, got triggered by almost any little thing, took everything personally (especially while driving, if some would cut me off I'd act like literal lunatic)

  
I knew of course smoking was bad for me but I didn't realize HOW bad untill I've stopped.

  
The reason I've stopped was the birth of my son. I knew I can't be that unstable while having a crying baby at home (and boy was I right lol)

  
I think you can't really stop if you don't want to. And I mean that literal. You really have to have the honest wish to quit.

  
Now all of the mental problems are just gone. Like I am a different person. The only things I still struggle a bit is concentration and memory but it gets better every day. I read a lot, take supplements, exercise and eat good food. I have motivation to cook now which is awesome.

  
So yea, life is getting good again and I really look forward to what's waiting for me.

1q3ir58,the universe gave me a sign (story),"I’m 20 years old and i’ve been smoking since I was 13 or 14. i want to commit to quitting, and today I got from morning to night without it. and just now something happened that will probably stick with me.

I got rid of all my weed so the only way for me to smoke is to get it from my mother’s jar in her room. she doesn’t mind if i take some and its easy to access so it’s tough to resist, it’s tough to quit in a house full of users.

a few hours ago, at about midnight, i went downstairs and sat outside her room for so long just fighting that urge. just sitting there, trying to delay the moment i would stand up to go get it. i knew i would probably get the weed, once i stood up. i even laid down and just tried to sleep in the couch we have in the dining room just so i wouldn’t stand up.

between the couch and her room, there’s a hallway with a little circular mirror, and from that angle you can see inside of her room. she had a red light and in that mirror it was just a circle of pure dark red. and it made me think about my eyes when i smoke, yk how they turn red. the design of the mirror made it look like a red circle surrounded by a nest of snakes. and like, idk, that felt like a sign. that’s not THE sign though.

unfortunately, that wasn’t enough to deter me. i did eventually stand up and go in her room, it was all dark red. i found the jar. i reached to open it but first i saw the sticker on top of it. “Poison”. it said, fucking, “Poison”. The full text was “pick your poison” but the first two words were written in red, so they couldn’t be seen in the light. without even thinking about it or trying to rationalize further why i should or should not smoke weed, i just left. and honestly i feel really proud. and i’m glad that happened.

Edit: I went almost 20 hours without weed. That’s pretty huge for me. Unfortunately i also went 20 hours without sleep. At 5am, i just had to cut my losses and smoke so i could fall asleep. But i’m still proud. I smoked the minimum amount, and im going to try again today. I’m realizing that cold turkey wasn’t a great idea, but i’m gonna need to find some support if im gonna be tapering.",1767508362.0,36,9,leaves,substance
1q3ipy1,Made it through Day 3.,"But now Night 3 has to happen, and the nights have been hell. I used pot to sleep for 5 years, due to recurring, disturbing nightmares, as well as (undiagnosed) restless leg syndrome. It was the only thing that stopped the horrific electric pressure that would build in my legs; otherwise I'd have to violently kick out to alleviate the feeling (though the moment you stop moving the leg, the feeling comes back) or slam my legs as hard as I could into the bed, over and over. 

After I started smoking, I met my soon to be husband and he has never had to experience this. Obviously, you can't really sleep well if the person beside you is having a whacky wavy flailing legs party. Last night I got the familiar RLS feeling in my legs, plus the sweats, the chills, the all-over aching, irritability, anxiety and of course the insomnia. To save my partner I moved to the couch at around 4am so I could twitch and kick out as i needed to. 

I've gotten about 4 hours of sleep in the last 48 hours, and I feel like I'm dying. Still dealing with sweats and chills and it feels like everything hurts. Everything. I just cannot seem to sleep. The RLS truly scares the crap out of me as it can be an early warning to Parkinson's Disease, which my grandmother has. She also had the restless legs all through her early life before diagnosis, so I think I've been numbing the feeling of my RLS with weed so I don't have to think of how scared I am of potential future neurological issues.

One reminder that I always come back to is that weed is NOT good for your health, especially when you smoke a lot/every day. I’m the type that has been smoking almost all day every day for years now. I’ve done countless research on scientific studies and posts on numerous forums about how weed is bad for your health, especially your cardiac system and your dopamine receptors. (Of course it is bad for other things too but these are the things I’ve looked into the most and seen repeated a lot.) Smoking weed too much can literally cause you to be way more likely to have a stroke or a heart attack even at a young age. I’ve seen quite a few posts about people in their mid and early thirties having heart attacks and being daily smokers since they were like 18.

Even if you cannot necessarily see or tell that weed is hurting you, it does and it will, especially if you are an every day smoker and have an addiction problem (as a lot of people do on this subreddit.) 

We’ve also been told that weed is completely harmless and I’ve had to unteach myself this lie. I always had a feeling it was never actually harmless but I know I used that to justify my usage, particularly when I was younger. 

This is just a reminder for me when I try and justify that smoking isn’t actually bad. Especially because I am one of those people that it is really hard to use in moderation. Your life may not be in complete shambles but you will be healthier if you are able to stop. I just wanted to post this because this motivates me a lot even on the days I don’t necessarily see the point in quitting or when the voice in my head tells me to just smoke anyway.

All of my friends that are still smoking are not well, they are all depressed, many of them haven't had a partner or even just sex with anyone for years since they're crippled with anxiety to talk to anyone else than their bud buds.

About a year and a half ago, I hit a wall mentally, I was depressed and started therapy and my therapist told me ""I can't force to stop smoking weed and we can continue therapy in any way, but it will be much more effective if you stop, at least for now"".

I personally romanticized my addiction a lot. Thinking in my head ""oh im so traumatized, of course i should numb the pain"". ""I derserve this"", ""this is how girls like you cope"" Or ""Im such a stoner, always smoking, hihi you only live once ect.""

(I have a hard time writing out these thoughts because it hasn't been a conscious thing since recently)

Looking back on these behaviors having grown as person. I realize i have to let go of these perspectives. But i find it hard to unwire my brain in that way because i feel like media portrays smoking and most drugs as ""cool""

I was wondering if anyone else deals with this. Is there even media to consume that romantises being sober?

1q36846,rough morning day 3 of quitting,"day 3 of quitting for the the new year (and my health, mind, body, and aligning with my values)

i was on track for the morning, getting ready for work when my bestfriend called me about a gym/sauna membership. 
i love the sauna & would go everyday if i could but i haven’t reached out to insurance for the possibility that i don’t need to pay as much. my bsf ended up trying to correct me about my insurance info even though we have different plans, and it came off condescending to me and i got quiet and said i needed to go because i felt triggered and that i deserved a better response first thing in the morning. 

i got angry from that all of the sudden so i started to journal and rip some pages to feel better and i kinda did start to feel a bit better while consoling myself about it being okay to be mad or sad after that call.

i was about to leave when i saw that my cat ate an egg tart and the crumbs spread all around the floor. i was pissed and yelled at my cats and after cleaning up the mess, cried on my way to work.

before work, i got gas and there was a dispensary next to it. i was heavily debating on if i wanted to just let myself relax with some weed but it didn’t feel right so i didn’t act on it. day 3 usually is really hard for me. 

i’m at work now and i feel so exhausted already. i feel absolutely sick of this shit and it was not even a huge obstacle i had to go through, so i have an inkling this is my inner kid throwing a tantrum & being really sad. i’m here for her but why the fuck is this so hard. 

i just want a joint. i want all of this to go away so that i can focus on work and not feel so stressed out. i wanna cry again.

Weed wasn’t just a habit for me it was how I survived trauma, isolation, and constant suicidal thoughts.

The first months of smoking felt like heaven, then it turned into 10g a day just to eat, sleep, exist. I’ve tried quitting before and failed every time, with really traumatic psych ward/rehab experiences that honestly made sobriety feel unsafe.

1q35zn6,My Turn To Share A Little Hope,"Hi friends, I wanted to share a little bit of hope myself. I have been experiencing CWS as opposed to CHS. I don’t think I was using long enough to get to CHS. However, in all my times of quitting, I have never experienced any physical or psychological withdrawal symptoms like this in my entire life. 

I have been sober from alcohol and pretty much all drugs since 2012. I have had a couple of slips from pot: once was a day over 10 years ago, a year of using pot at night, and then most recently all day every day. These carts are no joke. These are hard drugs that are miserable to get off of. 

I am on day 4 after going crazy on carts for 2 months. I was using them all day, every day. I was getting to the point where I wasn’t even getting the munchies anymore, and wasn’t hungry on my own much. 

I quit on NYE - that was my day 1. It was ok, that evening I started feeling rather rough though. Sweats, chills, it felt like the flu. No appetite, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, it was awful. For the record it wasn’t constant vomiting. 

Day 2 I didn’t eat much of anything. I was able to keep water down. I think I had half of an ensure, and tossed up that I wasn’t really going to eat. 

Day 3, I was able to take down half a smoothie, and another half of an ensure. I think last night I slammed a whole ensure, and another smoothie as well, along with a tiny bit of soup. I was finally able to start getting calories in my body.

Day 4, I have crushed 3 ensures, a few gatorades, and still feel bleh but still just so much better than day 2. That was by far the worst.

I also wanted to state and share that during this whole time I have been peeing and pooping regularly, so I knew my body was still functioning the way it was supposed to at a basic level, letting me know I am OK.

1q342zf,Am I doomed?,"I never thought I’d be posting my whole life story on Reddit, but I’m at a point where I just want to be okay. I deal with dark thoughts every day — I don’t want to go and I don’t plan to do anything, but the pain is constant and I feel like I’m barely hanging on, and I’m here because I want support and to get better.

Growing up I had a lot of abandonment and attachment issues. Even as a kid, whenever people left, I’d feel this deep panic and loneliness that never really went away. I was bullied a lot. I didn’t take care of myself, had terrible hygiene, and acted like an annoying jerk because I didn’t know how else to be.

Eventually I started going to the gym, lost weight, skated, and tried to reinvent myself — but instead of becoming confident, I just hid behind this “mysterious tough guy” act while still letting people disrespect me. I’d laugh things off, let people push me around, and pretended it didn’t bother me.

I ended up in a bad relationship — she was manipulative and unfaithful, and I was insecure and kept taking her back. I stopped going to the gym, stopped doing school, and eventually dropped out. One of my biggest regrets isn’t even the education — it’s missing the chance to grow, meet people, and be myself. I hurt my mom during that time too. She didn’t deserve the way I treated her, and I still carry a lot of guilt about it.

Then came weed and nicotine. At first it was just with friends, but over time I became a heavy daily user. I isolated more and more. The brain fog and derealization took over. Weed stopped being fun — it made me anxious, antisocial, and trapped in my own head while everyone else kept living their lives. I envied people who still had connection and family around them.

I got into more unhealthy relationships, made selfish choices, and hurt someone who didn’t deserve it. I still feel ashamed of that. I see parts of myself I hate and I struggle to forgive who I was.

Eventually I got a job working alone in a bottle room. It was a long, windowless hallway — and I spent entire shifts ripping carts. Blinkers back to back. I was going through a gram cart a day for years, plus constant vaping nicotine. I greened out at work more times than I can count. I pushed everyone away. My friends stopped inviting me out because I always said no, and honestly, I can’t blame them.

I tried quitting. The first days were okay — then the depression hit like nothing I’ve ever felt before. It felt empty and unreal, and I panicked and relapsed because I didn’t know how to handle that level of withdrawal. I eventually made it around 60 days sober, and the withdrawal depression finally eased — but I slipped back into “moderation,” which slowly turned into smoking multiple times a day again.

Now I feel like I’m stuck in the worst middle ground of substance use — I’m using just enough to stay foggy and numb, but any slight change in my routine or tolerance hits me with that soul-crushing withdrawal depression again. It feels like I’m trapped between staying sick and being terrified to fully quit because I remember how dark that withdrawal got.

Right now I have constant dp/dr, brain fog, guilt, shame, isolation, and regret. I’m out of work. Most days I don’t leave my room except on weekends — and even then I’m the quiet, awkward one standing off to the side. I want to fix my hygiene, get healthy again, quit weed and nicotine, clear my head, and actually feel alive — but I feel so weighed down that even getting out of bed is a battle.

I want to be better. I want to lose weight, take care of myself, be better to others, and learn how to love again — somewhere along the line I lost that. I don’t want to hate myself anymore. I’m scared and I don’t know what to do, and I’m here because I need help and advice from people who’ve been through this.

My questions for anyone who’s been here:
	•	How did you get through the withdrawal depression and dp/dr after quitting heavy carts?
	•	Has anyone else felt stuck in this middle-zone where even small changes trigger withdrawal?
	•	Did things eventually start to feel real and clear again — and how long did it take?
	•	What helped you push through the fear of quitting after relapsing?",1767469512.0,1,0,leaves,substance

1q2zxdp,The body pain is tough.,"55F started weed at 30 and smoked a joint at the weekend.  For the past fifteen years though I’ve been smoking 7 to 10 grams a day.  My last joint smoked was New Year’s Eve, so only on my third day, but the body aches are awful.

Day one my mood was calm (just increased my depression meds so I think that’s helping) but by noon I was nauseous, vomiting, the sweats and body aches.

Day two, mood is still good, nausea, body aches, sweats and a little vomiting.

Day three, mood still good, nausea gone, vomiting gone, sweats gone but the body aches are getting worse and I’m afraid I might just give in to get relief.

I live with a rare illness that pain is a part of, so I take prescription pain pills daily.  As I’m on low doses of painkillers and doctor doesn’t want to increase (which I’m fine with) and I used weed to help with the pain too.  With the illness I can’t work, so I’m home on my own every day.  Weed helped pass the hours.  It kept the boredom at bay.  

I’ve read that pain isn’t usually a symptom of withdrawal and yes, some of it is my illness, but I feel like I’ve been hit by a Mac truck.  It’s like the flu without being sick.  

Any tips to get through this pain?

1q2w0yr,Day 3 quitting THC pens.,"33M been smoking pot since I was 14. 

I made a post yesterday and this community honestly kept me from smoking in my day 2. Just want to say thanks to a lot of you. 

 Day 1 and 2 were fucking horrible, I slept thankfully, but my moods have been all over the place. Angry, depressed, suicidal, irritated, over and over again, it’s horrible. 

I think I’m posting this again to really express the dangers with these new THC pens. Here in Canada we have more pot shops then coffee shops. 

Never had an issue quitting anything , cigarettes after 15 years was a walk in the park compared to this. 80-95 percent THC in a single hit all day long over and over and over for years and years litteraly changes your entire personality and identity I swear..

Barley could talk to people in public, relationship with my dad started to decline as we work together doing HVAC and I would smoke that pen all day long.. And it hurts to see my destroy my relationships over my own addictions…. 

I thought i was going crazy with these random emotions, found myself crying for no reason what so ever and next thoughts were angry and suicidal thoughts. I was never ever suicidal. Don’t think I am but the fact these things are making me even have those thoughts is crazy. 

My 3 year old has autism, I’m working towards firefighting and EMS, and I have a great support system…. This is my “why” to get sober. 

I feel ok. I think I’m going to get over this finally once and for all… 

If anyone can relate to the pens I’d love to hear people’s experiences with it so I don’t feel like I’m going crazy.

1q2uya5,My sleep is worse but I feel more rested,"For a bit of context I had a two week stint of sobriety leading up to Christmas, I have been smoking daily since I was 15 (2020) so this was a huge milestone for me. After the first 5 days I noticed my sleep was way worse in terms of getting to sleep, staying asleep and being more restless. However, even if I managed to get 4 hours of sleep I felt infinitely more rested than I ever had in the past 5 years. 

I think you can be easily tricked into thinking you’re getting an amazing quality of sleep after smoking before bed, but in reality you’re robbing your brain of an important sleep cycle that helps with a multitude of things. 

One of the main reasons I was reluctant to stop smoking was due to me thinking I’d have to go months with little to no sleep, which has been true for the most part. But my brain and body feel much better for it, and you will too.   ",1767447846.0,8,3,leaves,substance
1q2ui8c,2 whole months!!,"First smoked at 16, then way more often from the time i was 21, now im 26 and im two months clean of it today and feel like sharing.

I’ve done the dance for about a year now of quitting for a bit then starting again, constantly trying to moderate, always ended up back at daily or near daily use. Back in September I started a romantic relationship with someone who does no substances and has his shit very together and that amped up the motivation for me and highlighted all the negative impacts it was having on me, but paradoxically I fell into heavier use than earlier in the year and felt more dependent than I had in a while.

What finally did it for me was so silly. I was supposed to go to a Halloween party hosted by a new friend of mine and several of her friends who all have birthdays right around Halloween. I’ve been wanting to get closer to this girl and meet more of her friends and integrate into their group a bit and was so excited to be invited. I told her I’d be there and had a costume ready that I loved. Bought some snacks to bring along I was completely ready to go. Then stupidly decided to have a couple tokes and ended up way too stoned and waffled for hours about going until it was too late and convinced myself it would’ve been rude to show up at that point. Sent her some excuses and apologized the next morning but I felt like id disappointed a new friend and thrown away something I was really excited about just to sit at home anxious and realized that’s just one small example of something I was constantly doing. Choosing weed over everything else and barely getting anything out of it anymore. Felt soooo stupid and ashamed the next day I knew that was it. I didn’t even have to throw everything out this time because every time I felt tempted I just thought again about that feeling of shame and it was easy to shut it down and choose otherwise. 

This time feels different because my goal is really and truly to quit. In the past I always had in the back of my mind, that I would ultimately come back to it in a “healthy” way someday but now I have accepted that this doesn’t exist for me. Even just the thought of one day doing it again morphs into doing it again soon, into doing it again this weekend or at that concert j bought tickets to, morphs into doing it again right now and then I loose control. I have to remind myself that even though there isn’t the same social dialogue around weed as alcohol or hard drugs , for me there really is this feeling of true addiction where one drop spirals into daily use every time. sometimes quickly sometimes slowly, but always eventually, it takes over, and I want better for myself.

There was some clarity as well, I realised I was still too dissociated being sober, I have a lot of things I need to work on but obviously weed is not going to help.

1q2kiva,Full abstinence,"So I used to be a round-the-clock smoker for 3-4 years, mostly during the pandemic. I quit in 2024, and marked a year without constant use this past September. 

I would allow myself to smoke on very special occasions (holidays or visits from friends) and I would never buy it for myself. On these occasions when friends with weed would come into town, I felt myself obsessing over when they would pull their weed out, and how to ask for a hit. Then, when the night was over, I would go back to not smoking at all until the next big event. The one-off smokes were never as fulfilling as I'd want them to be, and they always left me foggy the next day, not able to remember things from the night before.

I am proud of myself for no longer being a 24/7 smoker, but I know that full abstinence is probably better for me in the long run than what I've been doing. For anyone like me (who made the big change away from 24/7 stoner to once in a while Stoner without full relapse), what made you move away from the ""special occasion smoke"" to the never again, and what helped you continue to abstain?",1767413157.0,9,4,leaves,substance

Recently in December 2025 I was offered my first real career position with a company in the field I went to university for. I had applied for the job in May 2025 so this came after 6 months of waiting and then a successful interview. They scheduled me for orientation and said my offer was conditional after a background and driving record check. Those were clean so they scheduled me to come in for orientation. At the orientation they informed me they would be performing a drug test. My heart sank into the floor because I had smoked the day before and wouldn’t pass having not known about the test. Lo and behold I got a call today asking me if I had a medical card to explain my positive THC test. I do not, I live in a recreationally legal state so it honestly never occurred to me to get one (idiot). So basically I am waiting for Monday to get the news that my job offer has been withdrawn because of a failed drug test. This was the only thing I had to hold on to. I have been in poverty my whole life and have multiple chronic disabilities that could really use some attention from medical professionals but I do not have insurance and haven’t my entire life. This was supposed to be my big break: insurance, a salary, everything. And I fucked it all up because of my stupidity and my reliance on a drug. I have never felt more guilt, embarrassment, shame, and self loathing in my life. I don’t feel like I have anything to live for anymore and it’s all my fault, no one but mine.

It’s not a need,
Yet, 
I can’t stop.
I tried to blot
It from my mind.

Will I always be like this?
Will I always do this?

It’s on the way, the day is gay,
And still I’m filled with gloom. 
Just one more time is what I say,
Trapped by an eternal boon. 

I was good for a while.
Or,
At least I I pretended to be.
Or maybe it was true.
Maybe I really didn’t want it.
Maybe I really didn’t need it. 
I can’t remember now. 

Haven’t done it since November.
Here it is,
now I go right back,
to the inimical ember.

Quit once for 3 months in 2020 but the pandemic boredom got to me and I’ve been full steam ahead since. Never got to the point where I was stoned at work, but every night, most weekends started when I woke up, and for the last 6 months or so  I had been smoking as soon as I got off work. 

I smoked for the last time the day after Xmas and withdrawal has been way more intense than last time. I know I’m capable of sticking with it, having quit nicotine 8 years ago and alcohol 2 years ago, but it’s been a ride. Already suffered from insomnia, since I quit I’ve had multiple nights where I’m not sure I slept at all. Yesterday, after an argument with my wife I fell into a deep depression and could not get out of bed. Wasn’t even reading my phone, just laying there eyes open feeling stuck and empty. 

Only left the bed to use the bathroom twice, didn’t eat or drink anything, was in bed from going to sleep on NYE til about midnight last night - convinced myself I should at least brush my teeth. 

I think I’m turning a corner. Appetite is back with a vengeance, cleaned the whole house, and went for a brisk walk. I suddenly have this energy I haven’t felt in years, if ever. The irritability hasn’t gone away(wife is upset about me shutting down yesterday, not unjustified as I was a pretty huge a-hole before I went catatonic), but I feel hopeful again.

4. Podcasts. Mindless nonsense OR an audiobook about sobriety or somatic breathing.
5. Remembering that I am not the person I was before I started smoking multiple times a day.
6. I already felt like I was ok doing basic tasks, and didn't have the intense urge to be  finished so I could go home and smoke. This is a big positive for me, because I was starting to become agoraphobic - directly a result of THC and stress combo.

1q2boy2,A letter to myself,"‘Insanity is doing the same thing again and again, but expecting different results.’ False hope is cruel. We lie to ourselves, to avoid the truth, but the lie becomes far more painful and proves far more costly than the bitterest and brutalest truth. 

I have smoked up to 10 joints a day, all in an effort to be more creative. Yet for all the ‘enhanced creativity and depth’, I have 0 artistic or creative output to show for it. Like a slave, I have been devoted to my captor, faithfully and tragically. Miserably! Hopelessly…

I used to love reading and writing, but never seem to do much of either lately. I’m so busy smoking all damn day, I literally have no time left, to live my life. I find myself obsessed with it- I need it before everything, and after. It’s never enough. And that’s how i end up feeling, always needing more; never getting enough. Numb to my emotions, devoid of any genuine desire to do anything productive or fun with my time, boring as fuck but never bored enough to do anything real about it.

In fact, I can’t point to a single area of my life where I’ve gotten better, since I began smoking. From my social life, hobbies, traveling, to my career, income and professional life… everything has stayed stagnant or actually gotten worse. Yet I cling to my poison, like a shipwrecked sailor drinking seawater, the fear and the folly of the drowning. 

I miss being free and just being myself, my raw, real, messy self. I’ve lost myself, I don’t know who I am without pot anymore, feels like I’m being erased. My personality feels like a shell of what I used to be- my social skills, vocabulary, wit, overall interest/effort in life, myself, others, the world, my dreams and passions, my heart and soul have faded. I look in the mirror and do not see myself. Between us, a dark grey lifeless fog clouding everything in silence. Nothing excites me anymore, I no longer feel joy or elation, just withdrawal and respite. I want to feel alive again, the whole of it, the light and the shadow. I want to experience myself, others, life in the totality of it. The truth of it. I want to rediscover who I naturally am, without the haze or the scepter of addiction. I want my presence back, my emotions and memories, rather than floating through time and space not really even there. 

I have tried to moderate for so long that now I’m out of that delusional maze. I’m ready to commit to a new life, where I do not regret making the same harmful decisions again and again. I want to remember, to feel, and to dream again. 

‘Addiction is giving everything up for one thing. Recovery is giving up one thing for everything.’

That’s how I feel now. I’m not trying to quit now, as much as live sober instead. Focusing on what’s before me, rather than behind me, seeing now as a trail to the future instead of a chain to the past. Every organ in my body will thank me. My brain will thank me. My heart will thank me.

I have an amazing partner who loves me. I’m alive and healthy, this is my life, and I can do anything and everything I want with it. What I don’t want to do is let another half a dozen years go by in a depressing haze while my life passes me by. Stuck in my head, unable to remember what I came for, or what I was just thinking about. Isolating myself, halfassing my friendships, neglecting myself. Abandoning my dreams

I know it’s time. I’m ready for the first day of the rest of my life. Good luck to you all, my friends, the only advice I can leave you with is to bear in mind your why- what you’re looking forward, to not what you’re leaving behind. Look forwards, always, may the force be with us all.

In the end, I leave you with Mary Oliver’s timeless question, ‘Tell me… What is it you want to do with your one wild and precious life?’

1q2at1y,"Smoked half a joint on NYE after almost 4 years sober, almost a sort of experiment","After smoking for a decade I quit in early 2022, so I was almost 4 years sober. It was going great, weed was never on my mind, when walking past the weed store it was hard to imagine I used to visit there twice a day.

But new year's even came, I got completely wasted, and at 5am or something I shared a joint with a friend of mine. It wasn't a random slip, I knew what I was doing and that I was breaking a 4 year no-weed-no-nicotine streak. For me weed and nicotine are linked, because here weed is always mixed with tobacco, and realizing that double-whammy-addiction played a major role in my strategy to quit back in 2022.

Anyway, I got really really stoned, such a familiar feeling, a feeling that at one point controlled my entire life. I can't remember much of the actual experience because of how wasted I was. But here's the thing: ever since new year's eve, weed has been on my mind a lot. I've had relapses before, and I'm not planning on making this half joint into a full on collapse of my sobriety. But my brain keeps bringing up weed, the fact that I smoked it, the fact that I relapsed before, the fact that there's a shop close to where I live, etc etc. Today I was in the cinema and I got a very familiar feeling in my chest, which I always used to get when I was craving a joint.

I guess my point is; how absolutely insane, that after almost 4 years of sobriety, I smoke half a joint, barely remember it, but now I've been having cravings for 2 days. It's annoying but I'm not going to give in. I do hope it will stop soon.

For over a year I went back and forth between the idea quitting and not quitting, rationalizing that the medicinal properties helped me sleep, cope with stress, I even convinced myself that it was a healthy coping mechanism. 

Between Christmas and new years eve I finally decided that I'd rather be in reality, even if it is painful. The plan was to smoke a really good indoor joint on new years eve with my partner and call it quits after that, but after catching a cold I decided to start a day earlier, so technically this is day 3 but it's easier to count as though started on the 1st of Jan. 

I was expecting no sleep for 3 days straight, that's what happened the last time I tried to quit (I caved on night 3), I was surprised to find out that I did in fact get some sleep the past two nights, maybe because I started smoking less and less towards the end of 2025 but anyway. 

I'm sitting outside on my balcony, realizing that quitting weed isnt really a silver bullet to a better life, yes it's necessary but I'm realizing it's not even half the battle. The pain I'd been suppressing for years is rearing it's head, and it's occurred to me that quitting weed might not make me ""happier"", but more real and in the moment.

But the last two days made me just realize this won’t be possible. I never deemed myself as an addict and saying this out loud still feels strange. Right now it feels nearly impossible to never smoke again, feel every feeling, go through all the suppressed emotion I didn’t want to feel the last ten years.

1q29085,I’m 19 and my life feels like it’s over,"I’m your average gen z pothead. Showing up to class at 7:30 am my freshman year absolutely blasted off whatever cart I had that week. Halfway through class I’d go to the bathroom and rip that son of a bitch again. The older I got, the more my parents opened up to me smoking weed. I was the plug for all my dad’s friends at the ripe age of 16. What can I say, the little Mexican boy I bought from had the best weed in the state of Texas.

My dad was a drug addict and I suffer from intense social and psychological anxiety, so my life was extremely unstable and weed allowed me to connect with people who liked me for me (at least I thought, but now that I’m older I realize these relationships only involved weed, not companionship)

I have since highschool done away with carts now that I’m in college because carts made me feel what I like to call wungover, a weed hangover if you will. But now, I’m in a good relationship and my life feels better, but I feel like weed is holding me back. I want to be an architect, a good girlfriend, a successful worker, motivated, determined, creative, confident, consistent.

I have always been under the impression that I function better high. I drive better high, I’m more talkative, more focused, more productive, and while this was \*true\* while I was in high school, real adult life is knocking at my door. I had stopped smoking for a while my first semester of college, which I got really sick from, but life got the best of me and I found myself ripping Michelle obonga again. Now it’s 2026, I’m turning 20 in February, and I feel like the last 6 years of my life are a complete wash.

I’m scared to quit again because I remember how awful it was the first go around. I feel like because I’ve been smoking since I was 13/14 that this is just my life now. I feel hopeless about quitting and I don’t have the ability to see a future without weed.

TLDR: I’ve been smoking since I was 14, now I’m turning 20 in February and know a change has to happen, but I’m scared and I can’t imagine a future where I don’t smoke weed. Any advise or tips is greatly appreciated. I just need help.",1767384238.0,28,38,leaves,substance
1q28sb8,Quit weed 2 1/2 months ago,"Hello everyone,

I stopped smoking weed on October 19, 2025, and I'm wondering when my mental state will finally return to how it was before I started using. Many people report that they felt fine again after about three weeks. After two and a half months, I still feel like I have no drive, little joy in life, and problems with speech (slurring and word-finding difficulties). I also still have cravings from time to time—not as strong, but I still have them. In addition, I quit smoking regular cigarettes and nicotine on April 25, 2025. I currently need some motivation not to start using weed again. I think weed is my biggest problem right now, as I only quit on October 19, 2025. Will the psychological problems I mentioned get better again, or will I stay this way? I regret starting to smoke weed when I was 17. I'm 28 now. If only I had used it less often... but no, I smoked weed for 10 of those 11 years (only joints, no bongs).

1q28pa2,33 days sober,"(Repost bc my post was removed for some reason)

(23 F) Feel like I need to do some sort of reflecting. I’ve kind of just been day counting instead of intentionally moving. Trying to give myself grace as I just wanted to make it to thirty days before I start making steps towards my goals like exercising daily and cooking meals instead of eating out.

There’s been pros and cons to quitting, I guess like everything in life. I imagined I would feel like a new person by day thirty, but I guess sometimes we romanticize real mundane life. I’ve been feeling like shit about myself the past few days. But that’s not new. I’ve always struggled with my self esteem since I was a little girl. I still have strong desires to smoke and numb out these feelings. These neuropathways are deep rooted and I know it will take many months to change these automatic thought patterns. But saying no has gotten much much easier.

But to be more positive, my sleep has been so great. The brain fog has cleared and I can put together thoughts more clearly and coherently. I enjoy reading now instead of doom scrolling on my phone. And I feel my emotions more than I used to. I don’t have this stabbing feeling of disappointment every morning I wake up. Instead I wake up relieved I didn’t break my streak and I’m showing up for myself.

I feel nervous I might cave despite recognizing the good. I want to start attending more support groups more regularly as my brother in AA says this helps his motivation to keep going.

Anyway, if you’re reading and thinking about quitting, You can do it. I really REALLY didn’t think I was capable of getting to thirty days. But despite all the doubt, I am here.

1q288eu,"Day 14, sharing some thoughts I think I might help.","First of all, I want to wish everyone a happy New Year. I know this is a complicated time for you and for me, because we’re dealing with this substance. It’s hard to stay optimistic, it’s hard to feel like this will be “our year,” especially in moments like this. But today I feel more optimistic, and I want to share my story and some thoughts with you.

I’m 21 years old. I started smoking when I was 16, around the time of COVID, or maybe a little before. Mostly because of loneliness, lack of friends, and lack of connection. Weed gave me that sense of fun, that feeling of being self-sufficient, that cheap and easy entertainment. I found all of that in weed. Since then, there have been periods where I stopped for a year, or 11 months, or 3 months, or 4 months. I’ve had breaks, but it was never permanent. I always ended up going back.

Today I really wanted to talk about how our thoughts and our mind go through different stages when we stop smoking. Even within the same day, there are hours when I feel happy that I quit, when I feel motivated, full of energy, like I want to accomplish all my goals. And then there are other moments when I feel like I can’t take it anymore, when I want to buy weed and smoke just because I’m bored. These feelings definitely come in waves.

What I do want to tell you is that today is my day 14 without smoking, and I honestly am starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel. I’m beginning to feel that, yes, it won’t be easy, and there will definitely be days when I want to smoke, but it’s not impossible. It’s very easy to forget where we were before we quit. It’s easy to forget how bad we felt, how little energy we had, how little motivation to do anything, how after smoking we just felt sleepy, didn’t want to leave the house, didn’t want to do anything with our lives.

That’s why I think it’s extremely important not to forget how we felt during our worst moments with the substance. When we quit, it’s very easy to start romanticizing weed. It’s easy to remember the “good times,” when we first started smoking, when getting high felt fun and wasn’t a problem. But those days are over. They don’t exist anymore. They are not coming back.

It’s important to remember the position we were in when we decided to quit, the lowest point of the addiction, because it wasn’t pretty. If we’re in this forum and we’re quitting, it’s because this addiction has already damaged our lives or is trying to destroy them. It’s very easy to forget the bad parts. I know it is for me. But I also know that the moment I smoke again, all of it comes back: my digestive problems come back, CHS comes back, depression and anxiety come back, the lack of motivation, the loneliness, the disappointment in myself.

We paint it in our heads as something much better than it really is. And if any of us decided to go back to smoking right now, I’m sure it wouldn’t even be 10% as fun or rewarding as our mind is making it seem.",1767382512.0,6,4,leaves,substance
1q27v80,"Psychosis: Before, during and after","TL;DR: Made bad choices, went psychotic. Made better choices and things improved.

Part-time lurker, first-time poster.

I smoked pot and drank daily for the better part of ten years. During most of that time I was content and had decided that this was it for me. I had found the best course of action for me. I desired nothing more than to stay stoned and buzzed until I faded away; from life as well as from the memories of anyone who ever knew me. But things rarely go as planned.



I'm the youngest of three from an upper-middle class family. Had a decent childhood all things considered, although my parents were pretty miserable in their marriage by the time I reached my teens.

The first time I smoked pot was at 18, and it wasn't pleasant. My anxiety spiked and I got pretty paranoid, even though I was alone with my friends in my own home. 

However, the second time I had a blast. Loved every second of it, and was convinced I'd found something I could rely on for instant relief and a healthy escape from reality whenever the urge took me.

Flash forward to 2011. My second year of university was kicking my ass. I was suddenly no longer acing tests with minimal effort. I no longer felt like a gifted intellectual surrounded by hayseeds. Here I was mediocre at best, getting middling grades in basic courses when I really put my back into it.

Pot had become a weekly habit. I had my own apartment and my friends enjoyed coming over for sessions of blazing and video games. At this point things still felt manageable, and even though uni was a harsh reality check for my ego, I felt I could somehow handle it.

Then things got bad pretty quickly.

Within the span of six months I went through three severe losses.

First, my relationship with my high school sweetheart ended. I was beyond devastated since this was my first real girlfriend ever. We had lasted for three years, after I had been crushing on her from afar all throughout middle school. I was sure I'd never find anyone else who could tolerate, let alone love me.

Second, my parents announced their divorce. I felt like an idiot for not seeing it coming, and suddenly there was no ""home"" to seek sanctuary in. Just two separate adults that I was obligated to stay in touch with. And I thought ""if they couldn't make it work, what hope is there for me?""

Third, the family dog was put down. I grew up with him, got over my fear of dogs, and to this day love dogs because of him.

My academics continued to decline and I started smoking a lot more. I went to parties and concerts, drank way too much, made an ass of myself. I became hypersocial, tried to be everyone's friend all in an attempt to prove I had some kind of worth.

One morning, in a particularly bad hangover, something snapped. I suddenly realized all I'd ever done was just to make people think I was nice, just to make them like me. I wasn't a good person, I wasn't smart or noble, I was just a miserable kid who couldn't do anything; didn't WANT to do anything without everyone's approval.

And I was disgusted. I knew I had changed, I couldn't be the fun guy everyone around had come to expect, and if they saw me now they would share my disgust and abandon me.

So I pre-empted them. I isolated myself, cut off all contact with my friends, dropped my studies and just sat alone in my apartment. Drinking every morning, smoking every evening, jerking off and playing video games. That was everything.

After about a year a couple of my friends reached out, and I answered. I tried to tell them what had happened, and even though they didn't quite understand, they listened. And they didn't judge. I had friends again. I reconnected particularly well with my former study buddy who, as it turned out, had gone through something similar. He understood me all too well, and had pretty much dropped out just like I had. So we got into online gaming together, both NEETs, both smoking pot on a daily basis. Brothers in degeneration.



Years went by in the blink of an eye.



November 2021. Still drinking and smoking daily, on the computer from dawn to dusk. 

My friend and I had a falling out. And I was once again beyond grief. The one person that I thought I could always count on, I had allegedly betrayed and thus destroyed our friendship. I couldn't believe it nor did I know what to do. So once more I isolated myself.   
I was a mess of anger, sadness and indescribable mental agony. I tried to talk to him, he wouldn't listen to me. I was alone again, but this time I didn't choose it.

At this time, I noticed the drinking didn't help. It didn't comfort me nor did it dampen my rage. So I decided to try a couple days without the beer, for the first time in years. A couple days turned into a few more. The first ten were the hardest, since I couldn't sleep at all. It felt like my brain was in overdrive. Luckily, or so I thought, I still had weed.

By this time the pot had been making me progressively more paranoid over the years, and now with the social crisis I was far too anxious to smoke on the balcony as per my usual routine. At times I thought I could hear the neighbors through the walls, commenting on the smell and discussing whether they should call the police. So I decided to switch to edibles. I would go to my mother's cabin in the countryside and bake brownies to take home. 

I changed my dose and frequency too; from about 3 joints a day (circa 0.3 grams each) to two brownies every week (circa 1 gram each). In retrospect, not the best ways to edit my bad habits.

The neighbors' voices started getting clearer. I heard them more often and louder. First I could brush it off as my imagination, but that got more and more difficult. I started sitting perfectly still and quiet to better hear them. And the more I listened, the more I heard. Very specific comments. Taunts. Mockings and insults. Talking about what I'm doing, how I look, as if they could see me. I started journaling what I heard. How could they say those things? How can they know? Were there cameras in my apartment? Maybe my pot smoking had annoyed them, they tried to call the cops, the cops wouldn't do anything, and now they're taking revenge by spying on me. How did they get in here? Do they have a key? 

I was quite literally losing my mind at this point, but of course I didn't see it that way. I naturally assumed my sobriety and stillness had sharpened my hearing, and so I fortuitously was in the position to catch these twisted sadists red-handed. That is, unless this was all in my head. That was still an unlikely yet possible explanation.

Until one Friday evening when I had decided to stay off the brownies. I figured, if these voices are just a drug-induced hallucination, tonight I shouldn't hear anything at all, right? I put on a movie and tried to relax. About an hour into it, I got highly anxious for no reason. I paused the movie and walked over to my apartment door. I idly stared through the peephole, hoping I'd find the explanation for my fear there. After standing there in silence for about thirty seconds, I heard it, crystal clear:

""What are you gawking at? Put the movie back on!""

My mind was racing. I had never felt fear like that in my life. This was real, they can see me! They DO have cameras in here, but how? And where? Why can't I find them? I was paralyzed by terror and confusion. I shut off the main power to the apartment's electrics and went to bed, listening for hours to hear something, anything, though I was frightful of what I might hear. There was nothing, and finally exhaustion granted me rest.

The following weeks, months were a blur of panic and resignation. I kept hearing things; in my apartment, in my car, on the street. The paranoia was total. I was convinced these people, whoever they were, had hacked my computers and were watching everything I did, that my sad existence had become their private Truman show. I moved out and in my new home, the voices persisted. Particularly at night as I was about to fall asleep. They knew everything about me, and I was certain they had posted it all somewhere online.

I started therapy, stayed clean and sober, but I was despondent. No friends, no degree, no job, and persecuted by phantoms. I was sure it was over for me.

My friend reached out to me and we reconciled. I told him and others about the voices. Again, they didn't quite understand (how could they?) but once again they didn't judge. They listened and supported me, as did my family. Slowly but surely the voices faded, but my memories of them remained as clear as my conviction of their realness. In time though, I thought about them less and less. 

I decided to return to university and at least attempt to finish my degree. My friend did the same, and we supported each other all the way. We both succeeded in 2025.



And here we are in 2026. I'm four years clean and sober. I've lost 50 kg of weight, I completed my education, got a job in my field and bought a house with a mortgage. 

I'm 35 years old and I feel like I forfeited ten years of my life to weed, booze and self-pity. I don't know if I'll ever catch up to where I'm supposed to be, fix my brain or be happy the way I used to. 

But I do feel like I've just about climbed out of the hole I dug myself into. Maybe that counts for something.

So I (24m) have been an off and on smoker since I was about 16. My habit always follows the same cycle. I go really hard for 1-2 months and cold turkey for about 6-10 months. Typically oil pens, occasionally edibles. High all day.

Well I am back to cold turkey stage. Really struggling this time.

About 2 months ago I lost my 2 year relationship (we were previously living together, now back with parents). The breakup wasn't explosive but ive been in a really bad headspace since and a month ago picked up my old smoking habit.

I think im really struggling this time because I dont have that support system or comfort to know it's going to be okay even if I feel like shit, I have a really hard time believing myself without outside validation. (Something im in therapy for.)

Well here I am now on day 2. I'm not sure how/why my body builds up a tolerance so quickly but all of my previous attempts have been horrid. (3 weeks of not even feeling like I belong on planet Earth!)

Currently sitting working but experiencing depression, anxiety, brain fog. My head is spiraling and the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia are colliding with my already fragile mental state. 

I know that im paying for all the numbing I did to myself the past month. I just want some advice on how to make this withdrawal not so horrid? I do the basics like: exercise, sauna today, and hydrating. But the anxiety is the most unbearable part. I can handle the loss of appetite or brain fog. But I really want the anxiety to calm down!

Sorry if this read more of a vent, I guess this is apart of the process. Not my first rodeo, I know first 7 to 14 days are riddled with these symptoms.

It was more recreational when I was in my 20s but in the last decade having weed being legal here in Canada, I’ve started smoking those thc pens, mostly for the convience, but ALL the time. 

Fast forward 3 years of smoking thc carts. It’s gotten so bad I smoke it the second I wake up.. even before I drink water,…smoke it after I get dressed, smoke it at work, during work, after work, when I get home, before dinner , after dinner. You get the idea. 

It’s completely controlling my life. I quit these things last year for 1 month and I have NO idea why I’d smoke it again. I want to go from HVAC to firefighting as it’s a goal of mine since I was young before I got into addiction..

Now I’m trying to quit again and it’s SUPER hard. I get super super depressed, litteraly cry over random IG reels, irritable, barley eat….. my sleep is ok, but I feel I’m having a harder time this go around…

I don’t think people realize how addicting those thc carts are. And I’m not talking the cheap disposable ones, I’d spend 45 on a cart every 2 days live resin (1G)

I’m having such a hard time… I haven’t smoked since new years night 11:59 was the last time I puffed. I want to become a firefighter, and be a better partner and father… it sounds cheesy, but I want to go cold turkey because this would be the first year completely sober since I was 14.. just that makes me sad.

I've been lurking around this forum for a long time, getting the inspiration and living through hardships together with you guys. With much appreciation I'm thankful for everyone in this forum for keeping the hope alive by reminding and inspiring. There is no way i could have gradually, over the years, moved further and further from the delusions of life it gave me. 

I'm still relearning to live, to think coherently, push through resistances upcoming in my body and move with them with peace. 

Anyone quitting I would recommend doing yoga to learn your body stay through uncomfortable feelings. Doing meditation also has a profound impact in every aspect of life. I've come to realisation that keeping the attention and deeply thinking is the main axis over anything anyone is trying to achieve and both practices has a lot to offer in this region.

Also I'd like to encourage you to look for more information about burned adrenal glands and how it impacts reaccuring addictions. In addition to that please make a research about heavy metals and how they are absorbed by the plant and how they toxic our brains, blocking the neurologic pathways keeping you in the same destructive circle.

For anyone still haven't made a move I would suggest to do it immediately stop wasting another minute of life. The difficulty of letting it go is enormous, and the pain is huge, come to terms with it and have a courage to suck it up. Every day after you quit will be better and better, the sweats, the pains, the nightmares, sleepless nights and the urges are your battle, enjoy every minute of it because you are wining even if darkness covered every pathway you are able to see at that moment or the anxietys makes you shaking, these are the pains you have to repel. Prepare yourself in every way, it is the main battle of your life.

I've realised I've no longer have the an obligation to come back to this forum, I have put a lot of energy recovering from it and it's time to spark the creativity within myself and enjoy life by building it, serving people, creating value and so on.

1q1uepd,Looking for advice managing sobriety and friendship,"I've been smoking weed every day, multiple times a day since I was 16. I'm 22 now and have been trying to taper my usage and finally hit my breaking point last night. It was my goal to fully quit on January 1st, and after spending the whole day sober I felt miserable. Just so, so sad and exhausted. I gave in and rolled up, but after a few tokes it was as if I had a cosmic revelation and thought to myself: ""I don't actually want this."" and put the joint down and went to sleep. I'm throwing everything I have out today. 

What I'm struggling with is that all my friends still smoke all day, everyday as well.. It's the baseline activity for our hangouts; smoke, game, talk, etc. Half of my friend group wants to quit as well, but the other half doesn't see their smoking habit as problematic. I don't want to lose them or stop hanging out with them, they are my closest friends and we truly do love and care for each other. But I'm not sure how to maintain these friendships when I know for a fact I cannot resist the temptation to smoke with them when they're still sparking up every time we hang out. 

I still live at home and my mom has similar smoking habits to me. She also wants to quit, but just for the health of her lungs, so she still steeps teas and eats edibles. It feels so hard to live in a house where consumption of THC is so normalised. I also don't want to ask her to fully quit, since it's her life and her choice.

Was having a fun night with my friends drinking a little bit and then decided to hit my bong. within minutes my heart was thumping so fast and I felt so sick. I’ve always hated being crossed as it would almost immediately make me feel awful but I had only taken a few shots so I thought I would be fine. I got the shakes uncontrollably and seriously thought I might need to go to the hospital. Eventually went away after I forced myself to go to sleep. Next day I hit my friends pen and very similar thing happened with no alcohol - heart thumping extremely fast, heat waves, basically having a panic attack and extreme discomfort. I decided to stop drinking and smoking after that. This was 13 days ago now.  

I have been a basically daily/all day smoker for at least 5 years and I currently work at a smoke shop plus my bf smokes daily. Bong, joints, blunts, all of it but dabs were my favorite. I still want to smoke but I have pretty good self control since it started making me feel so bad. First week quitting I was having horrible intense waves of anxiety, discomfort, and just an awful dreadful feeling. It seems to be getting better each day but it still hits randomly and frequently. I’m diagnosed w depression, anxiety, adhd, and I’m more than likely autistic so I feel like it’s just my feelings finally coming to the surface after being numbed for so long.

Ever…and you’ll never smoke again!

I’ve posted this before, this is the acronym I learned 18years ago when I quit smoking cigarettes. N.o.p.e has helped me through the holidays, I clearly understand now that I can not be a “sometimes” smoker.  16 months ago I fooled myself again thinking -I’ll just buy 1 and I won’t go back to my daily. Well 3 months later as Im getting high multiple times a day, I walked into a pot shop(I live in a really small town) the owner was there, he had no employees, just him. So I said “if you ever need somebody, I have the certificate needed”. He said it was a police check he needed because it took about a month for it to go through. I said” oh I just had one done for a course I was gonna take.

Next thing you know im basically running the store lol. He had another business he needed to take care of and it was in southern Ontario and this shop was way up North.

He quickly trusted me and here I am..a pothead.. doing the orders for the store! I had a 30% discount and I spent hours on the OCS ordering site.

It was the best job ever, I loved learning about weed and different ways of consumption. I was watching videos and learning as much as I could. Then I discovered Reddit and I found a wealth of information about what the “good stuff” is on the market. 

7 months after I started he closed the business due to insurance issues but by the time a had cooler full of top notch weed stocked up!

Finally on December 8 I quit a 15 month daily run of smoking way too much!

This time im doing the n.o.p.e because I’m 52 and this needs to stop 🛑

1q1nhup,Need to quit but use for help going to the bathroom,"Hello. Have been smoking for almost 7 years now, the past two years it’s been everyday. Quit an apprenticeship because of mental and physical health issues as well as it being a toxic workplace two years ago. Thought I would spend a month or two getting my health back on track but it’s all just snowballed, feeling so much worse than I ever have, struggling to work, and am now dead broke. Couldn’t pay rent last week. 


Still smoking though. Still finding any way to get some weed. I smoke ‘cones’ and spin them with tobacco. I mostly use it to help me with going to the bathroom, it helps me strain less when pooping. I recently found out I have gluten intolerance, which would explain some things. But now I’m psychologically trapped into thinking I need it to help me poop better. I have a hernia which is most likely from straining too. I thought it was just the nicotine, so I tried vaping, then ended up addicted to both weed and vapes. Got help from my doctor with nicotine patches and threw out the vape. But I still go for the spun cones. 

I also have severe anxiety, which is also a factor in me smoking. Any time I’ve quit for a bit or slowed down, i fall back into the bad habit around my period (suffer from PCOS and a form of endometriosis as well). I was seeing a psychologist which was helping, she was only $50 a session as she was provisional. When her placement ended there was only normal psychs and they were $230. Absolutely not feasible for me, even with the rebate, at the frequency I would need to see them. I also am highly highly suspicious I have ADHD - I was curious always curious about it for myself, and then dad ended up getting diagnosed. It feels like it’s affecting my ability to work and learn more and more everyday but I cannot afford to do anything about it. My parents can’t help me with it, I’m already straining my mother financially and feel so guilty about it. But I don’t know how to get myself out of whatever hole I’ve dug for myself. On top of internal struggles I was also in a stressful relationship, which I finally ended a few months ago. I had mostly quit weed at that point too, but quickly found myself in the habit again. 

I struggle so much with my energy and have fried my dopamine. I had fallen out of habit taking my iron tablets, which affected my energy greatly, but even with taking them again I feel so weighed down, and it’s the weed. I know it’s hindering rather than helping me, but I can’t find it in myself to stop. I’m scared of all the emotions that will come up during quitting, I feel so fragile when I’m withdrawing, and the last year I’ve felt fragile enough as it is. 

There are a lot of factors for why I smoke, and I can’t seem to get a hold of any of them. It feels like when I’ve finally helped one problem, every other problem gets worse, I’m constantly playing catch up with myself. I feel like that mechanic sculpture that leaks its oil and is constantly cleaning it up. I’ve seen close friends quit but they had a lot more support than I do. I also feel like everyone’s telling me, “you just need to build a boat!”, whilst I’m already in the ocean drowning. Like no shit Sherlock a canoe would be of great assistance right now if I had any fucking foundation to build it on.

I’m sorry for the wah, I just feel so stuck and I’m unable to be completely honest with anyone around me because it’s scary.

1q1jh9r,Help,"I never thought I’d be posting my whole life story on Reddit, but I’m at a point where I just want to be okay. I deal with suicidal thoughts every day I don’t want to die and I don’t plan to hurt myself, but the pain is constant and I feel like I’m barely hanging on.

Growing up I had a lot of abandonment and attachment issues. Even as a kid, whenever people left, I’d feel this deep panic and loneliness that never really went away. I was bullied a lot too. I didn’t take care of myself, had terrible hygiene, and acted like an annoying jerk because I didn’t know how else to be.

Eventually I started going to the gym, lost weight, skated, and tried to reinvent myself but instead of becoming confident, I just hid behind this “mysterious tough guy” act while still letting people disrespect me. I’d laugh things off, let people push me around, and pretended it didn’t bother me.

I ended up in a bad relationship she was manipulative and unfaithful, and I was insecure and weird and kept taking her back. I stopped going to the gym, stopped doing school, and eventually dropped out. One of my biggest regrets isn’t even the education it’s missing the chance to grow, meet people, and be myself. I hurt my mom during that time too. She didn’t deserve the way I treated her, and I still carry a lot of guilt about it.

Then came weed and nicotine. At first it was just with friends, but over time I became a heavy daily user. I isolated more and more. The brain fog and derealization took over. Weed stopped being fun it made me anxious, antisocial, and trapped in my own head while everyone else kept living their lives. I envied people who still had connection and family around them.

I got into more unhealthy relationships, made selfish choices, and hurt someone who didn’t deserve it. I still feel ashamed of that. I see parts of myself I hate and I struggle to forgive who I was.

Eventually I got a job working alone in a bottle room. It was a long, windowless hallway and I spent entire shifts ripping carts. Blinkers back to back. I was going through a gram cart a day for years, plus constant vaping nicotine. I greened out at work more times than I can count. I pushed everyone away. My friends stopped inviting me out because I always said no, and honestly, I can’t blame them.

I tried quitting. The first days were okay then the depression hit like nothing I’ve ever felt before. Terrifying, empty, unreal. I panicked and relapsed because I didn’t know how to survive that feeling. I still regret that. I eventually made it around 60 days sober, and the withdrawal depression finally eased but I slipped back into “moderation,” which turned into smoking multiple times a day again. Now I feel stuck in the worst middle ground: using enough to stay foggy and numb, but terrified of quitting because I remember how dark withdrawal got.

Right now I have constant dp/dr, brain fog, guilt, shame, isolation, and regret. I’m out of work. Most days I don’t leave my room except on weekends and even then I’m the quiet, awkward one standing off to the side. I want to fix my hygiene, get healthy again, quit weed and nicotine, clear my head, and actually feel alive but I feel so weighed down that even getting out of bed is a battle

I wanna be better, I want to fix my hygiene I wasn’t to lose weight I want to be better to others, I wanna know how to love cause somewhere down the line I’ve lost that..

1q1gza0,"36 hours in, please send hope","Hi friends. I’ve been sober from alcohol for 13-14 years. I’ve had a few slips with pot - once with approx 2 years sober, stopped after the first hit. 

Second was October 2024, it lasted for about a year, but it was only at night. 

This most recent time, I came back from international travel, think I had gotten salmonella poisoning otw home. I was so nauseous from the sickness I used pot as a crutch. It has stuck for the past two months. I have been using pens/carts for the past two months, all day, every day.

I am probably 36ish hours in to stopping, and I feel absolutely terrible. The nausea is so bad, I haven’t had a real bite of food in nearly 24 hours. Keeping anything down is tough, even ensure. I can manage to keep some water down.

The anxiety combined with the nausea is an absolutely vicious cycle. I never felt like this when I quit previously, and my god its unreal.

I know I am not dying, I know I will be ok, I am just struggling. My body is so out of regulation. 

I am looking for hope. I don’t ever want to feel like this again. I just want to feel like me again… ",1767306169.0,36,25,leaves,substance
1q1ghnm,Reflecting on how deep in survival mode I’ve been,"I’m currently on day 12 sober from weed after smoking for about 4 years (with a few breaks mixed in). I still feel very foggy, feel like I have no identity, struggle to keep myself busy, etc. I also quit my birth control a couple of weeks ago, so my hormones are very scattered rn I’m sure. 

This past year was spent running from myself. Numbing myself with weed. In relationships that didn’t benefit me. Gaining weight from emotional eating/munchies. Working to get a promotion I’ve now realized isn’t even what I want to spend my life doing. I made a lot of decisions in a haze - and now everything is all over the place. 

I realized that in order to become the woman I want to be, I have to be connected to myself and my emotions. I need to accept where I’m at without running and find my way through without a substance clouding my view on things. It’s like I’m grieving everything that’s happened the past couple of years - like I was never really ‘there’ even if I was physically there. I was using it to cope with my depression/anxiety, but it rly made it all worse 

Idk what the next steps are. I’m just kind of venting but if anyone has experienced this and has advice, please let me know your experience & how you got through it. I’m pretty upset with myself rn ",1767304954.0,31,7,leaves,substance
1q1gbd5,Tapering actually worked for me this time,"I started taking edibles in 2020, probably like a lot of other people. Prior to that, I'd only smoked once in college and that was it (35 now.) The first edible I took in 2020 basically took me to the moon and I was hooked. I told myself it would be a special occasion thing, a weekend thing, a night time thing... but over time, for 5 years, I basically ended up taking it from noon til night. I developed an insanely high tolerance, to the point where I was taking anywhere from 50-150mgs every day and felt literally no effects besides a slight buzz. I don't really trust the mgs on these, even though I was buying from the most ""reputable"" brand. All I know is that I depended on it, even though nothing was happening. I went work ""high,"" I went to social functions buzzed, I just basically ate them like vitamins. I drank them in syrup form straight. I popped them in the car driving long distance because I got bored. I spent god knows how much money. It's extra stupid because I don't even feel anything.

I've tried cold turkey 4 times. Every single time, I went through brutal sweats, mood swings, depression, insomnia, nausea, weight loss, just awful awful flu-like feelings, and debilitating migraines. Shit was so bad. I know you guys know. 

This time, early December, I had a lot going on for the holidays and wrapping up work stuff. I ended up skipping a day somehow. So from that day on, I decided to taper my edibles in half. Theoretically, ""25mg."" I did this for about a week. I don't feel any buzz anyway so I didn't miss the effects. The next week, I went down to 15mg. Then it was Christmastime and in between all the stuff I was dealing with, I would half forget some days, sometimes remember, and I was down to taking 5-10 mgs a day.

And today, I feel no adverse effects, and I haven't taken an edible at all for a few days. I think I've finally done it. 

I did try tapering before but I think I did it with the mindset of going on a tolerance break so of course, I eventually went back. This time, I just wanted to stop. Recording this today to remind myself that this might have been a complete fluke that I suffered no harsh effects this time, but that's all the more reason to stay off. Tapering doesn't always work, I know that, but I urge you to try it this time, keep yourself extremely busy, and see if that doesn't help.

I also took edibles at night, lying to myself that it helped me sleep. And it did get me to sleep. But now that I'm sleeping naturally, I am sleeping SO DEEP. It feels delicious. I can't remember the last time I slept so well, and I'm guessing it must have been pre-2020. I even dreamt for the first time in 5 years. I missed dreaming so much. Now I'm starting a dream journal so I can try lucid dreaming, or at least be able to remember more. A new journey for me this year. 

I will say, I do feel a it on edge more, a little more irritable and anxious, but I'll deal. I'm just glad I don't have the sweats, nausea, and migraines, those were the worst symptoms for me.

I don't want to waste 2026 like I did the past 5 years. And who the hell knows what I've done to my body with the high doses I was taking, I'm still scared about that.. But no more. No more!",1767304548.0,6,1,leaves,substance

1q1fien,Paranoid,"Ive started smoking weed occasionally since summer of 2024, I don’t do it often anymore. In winter of 2024 I started getting weird and paranoid thoughts of my family and social life. I believed everyone was out to get me and they knew something that I didn’t know about myself.

Sometimes I’ll be walking and I’ll see something from the corner of my eye but there’s nothing there. I get severely paranoid.

For new years I had a hair appointment then I decided to smoke (cuz why not) and the strain was so intense. I was so high, I felt like a pig with lipstick on. I was so disappointed in myself for no reason. I only smoked 1/4 of the blunt and then threw it away (a waste ik). I just hated what I saw in the mirror but I spend so much time improving myself. I don’t feel like that right now only when I’m high and I hate it. I’m gonna quit smoking but I’m interested in knowing the science behind. It used to be relaxing. 

Weed hasn’t been fun for me for a long time but I have access to it cuz of my friends. When I smoke sometimes I lose my hearing temporarily, It’s difficult to breathe, my thoughts race, I’m so stupid when I’m high, I hate the smell, i see things, my whole body twitches uncontrollably. my disassociation was terrible but it’s getting better now.

1q1669d,I'm Done,"Hey everyone,  
  
I’ve posted here once before and have been a long-time lurker. This week was especially hard with quitting, and last night I decided it would be my final time, for good.

One of the hardest parts of all of this has been the physical fallout. The worst symptom I’m dealing with now is constant ear drainage and fluid trapped behind my eardrums. My ears feel full all the time, my hearing is dulled, and it’s deeply unsettling. I’ve also been diagnosed with a sinus infection and inflammation that’s spread to my ears, nose, and throat, a direct result of vaping. I’ve damaged and scarred my sinus tissue.

This has hit me harder than I can really explain because music has always been a huge part of my life. Early on, weed made music feel incredible, immersive, emotional, almost transcendent. As an audiophile, that mattered a lot to me. But now, because of the fluid in my ears, I can’t properly hear music anymore. I haven’t *felt* music in a long time, and losing that connection has hurt me deeply. Something that once brought me grounding and joy now just reminds me of what I’ve lost.

Last night, I had a very different idea in my head of how my “last time” would go. I imagined one final, peaceful toke before walking away forever. Instead, the experience completely broke the fantasy.

As soon as I pulled on the vape, my face started pulsing and my head began pounding. My chest and throat felt like they were burning. It scared me deeply. There was no relief, no closure.. Just fear, sickness, and a clear awareness of what I’m doing to my body.

What stands out most is that my last vape wasn’t pleasurable at all , it was alarming. The fantasy is gone. Instead of a “big goodbye,” it felt like a warning.

On the 31st, I had a strong vision in my mind of what quitting would look like. Instead, I went to bed shaken and woke up this morning with a headache, but also with clarity. My goal now is presence, listening to my body, and not abandoning myself when fear shows up.

1q0grmd,"I was succesful , more than a year without smoking, i was proud of it and proud of myself, until few things happened in life.","I was young , so i quit rather easily, i was dedicated to change , i have been daily (more like nightly) smoker for 4 years at that time, but i wanted to change. I started working out, had bright plans for future but life happened. I got assaulted from behind and ended up in hospital because some assholes decided that they do not like me. First time i was at festival and since then last. Not like i was used to going out at all, but why not try to socialize finally. I finally looked healthy etc, i just wanted to have a fun. At that time i was clean for more than a year.



Broken jaw , not able to eat, not able to workout, all i could do is almost nothing, without food i had no energy. I started to be more and more depressed and bough some weed, so time would pass faster and i would feel atleast a bit better. Then all the stress from police started, like i was the one who attacked 5 people. They could not find 2 out of 5 of them, but my parents did after a year. Nobody got punished properly (no jail time, only fines) and i ended up with the lowest mental state i have ever been, dropped out of college in first few months because i was not able to be near people, i felt extremely anxious and could not focus. After long wait for psychiatrist, , she told me i had ptsd, i got prescribed meds. Stopped smoking once again, everything was somewhat fine until shortage of those meds happened and i become a lab rat and started having withdrawals and psychiatrist changed my meds 3 times in one month , each week worse than the other. I was awake many nights because i could not fall asleep. After my original meds came back on market, i still had side effects and worse. This time i was once again in college and i handled it quite well until the shortage happened. With all those side effects from meds i decided to smoke again because i was hopeless.  I could not workout properly, even going for a walk was enormous effort for no good reason.

Somehow i managed to taper off meds, smoking made it somewhat easier, i ditched the psychiatrist, she would not listen to me and wanted to just up my dosage and i knew that i would never get off them, i had lesser side effects but still. It was one of the harder one to get off.



Somehow i managed to do few of my exams but i could not keep going more, college started to be more unfair towards me, because how could i even explain all of this? Tried, nobody cared in that system and my disdain increased, i just quit, because everyday after i came back from lectures, i was in tears, how to even finish my 5th semster. The curriculum was changed in order to test new subjects, it was difficult to find study materials and notes because the subjects were brand new, i had all the old ones, i was prepared for the old subjects, i had all the notes etc from people that went there, but it was useless, because it changed too much even the old subjects were changed. I was one of the best students in my year, the two better than me left a year before me.



Fast forward to today , i am off meds , i do not want to see another therapist and psychiatrist ever again. I do not want to try again going to college because i am dissapointed from the last try.

I have been smoking weed for 1 and half year almost daily once again, my sleep is suffering because of it, not like while i was on meds but still. I feel bad because i just wasted time in college which i could not finish because of my mental state and inability to be flexible enough, i should have cheat as much as others did. I want to quit but also i worry that i will crawl back to it if my life becomes too difficult for me again. Working for my parents, trying to workout as much as i can, which is now barely twice a week, but keeping my 6 year streak of never stopping and doing anything i can even while i am down. Which feels like eternity with very small highs and big lows.



I had some more health issues that i could write about but then this post  would be even longer, it is long enough right now. They were neither major nor minor, so there is that.



Today is the day that i am quitting once again, this time it feels harder than last, but i want to quit... I am just worried about my life and starting from this lowish point, while i see many peers and other people succeed and then i look at myself. The biggest accomplishment i made since all of this was that i kept working out and was somewhat useful while working for my parents. Sometimes i just ask myself i it is worth to keep living, but knowing how much effort my parents made to help me, i just have to.",1767197830.0,6,5,leaves,substance
1q0est7,A traumatic psychotic episode forced me to quit weed,"Hey all, 

I stumbled upon this forum and hoping this post can open up some eyes about the dangers of marijuana use, no matter what age you are.

A little back story, weed only really became this miracle drug for me 2 years ago (I smoked weed in my younger years but always gave me anxiety, since legalizing and being able to mix strains I got high in ways that made me feel great and creative like never before).

I used and was addicted to all sorts of substances in my 20’s. Tbh it wasn’t as bad as people around me but weekends almost always entailed in some type of indulgence. I started putting those behind me as I started a new career and met an amazing partner a few years ago, and for the first time in a long time I started seeing a bright future ahead. My passion for starting a family and excelling in my career became paramount, and at some point I started smoking week mostly to decrease the stress from my job but that started making me get grand thoughts and motivation like I’ve never had before. I truly started feeling I can take on the world. I didn’t smoke much, maybe a gram or two every week, and about 4 days of the week. 

Things were fine mostly but earlier this year things slowly starting to feel off. My paranoia started increasing subtly, and I was forgetting things at work that made overthink. I didn’t realize this yet, but my mind was slowly slipping. Then on a little retreat, things took a turn for the worst. I took some edibles and what followed were months in a complete nightmare. That night, started having extreme bouts of paranoia and had trouble sleeping. When I came back to town, I threw away all my weed, grinders feeling very off from the getaway. A few days later, I woke up in the middle of the night to a dream that felt like I was in hell. Went about my day extremely awake and manic, and then had thoughts I was SA’d by a family member. Went to the hospital at this point and people around me were concerned, as this came completely out of no where. Stayed a few hours there, and I was urged by my partner and family to go home, as my allegations could cause serious problems and they were suspecting something wasn’t right with me.

I left after waiting hours and not seeing a doctor. Went home and the next day I had to go back, this time to a different hospital and they rushed me to the psych emergency. I spent a few hours there, they prescribed me some anti-psychotic meds and discharged me. Went home and the following morning, I attempted a sui. At this point, I started believing I was possessed and being punished by god (not a religious person btw). Got rechecked back into emerg, moved up to the psych ward where my delusions got worst and started hallucinating. My driving licence was suspended at this point. Now friends found out and starting reaching out, checking in and stuff. I became isolated and didn’t trust anyone, friends, my partner, family or the hospital staff. I attacked the staff at some point and got strapped down and injected to sleep.

3 weeks go by and my family insists I go home, now I’m on stronger anti psychotics and other anti drugs. Over the summer I dealt with severe depression and had constant thoughts of wanting to end it, began therapy as well. Delusions about religion continued along with paranoia about people around me. I started having thoughts of wanting to harm others so I went back to the hospital a few months later. They prescribed me new meds and was discharged about a week later. Finally, started seeing progress this time. 

Lived through half a year of hell, but happily saying things are great and even better than before. I have a new lease on life, my skills at work have improved and I’m connecting better with my partner, family and friends. I think weed can help people for sure but one thing I learned is you just never know if you’re the u lucky 1% that gets struck with a severe mental condition. I definitely didn’t expect it, no personal or family history of mental illnesses and boom psychosis strikes out of no where.

I’ve been taking steps to quit for a month now by not renewing my medical card and running out my stash. I made a plan to visit my family in a state where recreational is not legal for a week to help me not give into cravings. 

So far I’m feeling okay but not great. I’ve had like a low grade headache past 2 days and I’m waking up nauseous which isn’t fun. I used marijuana first thing every morning to prevent feeling nauseous and I’m missing that relief. Ate some dry cereal and that seemed to help a bit.

I’m also missing the oral fixation that smoking gave me. Thinking about getting a Fum flavored air thing to help with that craving. 

I really want to quit this time but I’m having anxiety about what happens when I go home and I have access to recreational dispensaries. I’ve smoked for so long to treat my anxiety, chronic pain, nausea that I’m scared what my future health holds. But I want to go back to school so I can work in healthcare and marijuana is preventing me from doing that. I’m tired of being a slave to my smoking cravings.

Sleep and eating has been better. I have been streaming a lot of TV to stay distracted during the boring hours I would usually smoke to make interesting. Ahedonia is less severe.

I smoked flower only for about 20 years, multiple times per day. The first week was a nightmare, second week was horribly boring, week 3 I feel closer to my old self with more pep in my steps and sense of humor has rebounded. I think I will start my usual workout routine again next week.

1q08y56,Quit at the start of a new project,"Hi all, I just want to share what's helped me quit

I've quit a few times over the years. The latest time is the first time I've actually planned not to go back eventually

I've always found just quitting by itself basically impossible because boredom, ennui, and any minor setback is too good a reason to give in

Declaring my intentions to people I care about and not having it in the house certainly help

But the real key I have found is to have some project or goal you're working towards. Something to get obsessed and absorbed into, because going back to weed will only make achieving that goal harder and its something to focus your agitated energy on

Last time, I spent 4 hours a night  writing a screenplay. This time, I'm setting up a business.

Honestly, I'm quite hopeful that the business will be a good long term solution because it's obviously a huge fucking risk, the rewards are all my own and I can always work on the company's side projects in evenings where I want to smoke.

Obviously, it's important to rest and recover (which is hard when your default method is smoking), so I've already had issues with overdoing it, but I'm making sure to build more socialising into my schedule, hanging out with non-smokers, taking up hobbies I've wanted to do for a while etc

I just wanted to say all this because I often see people here say ""keep busy"" which is good advice, but for me, without some end goal to work towards, keeping busy is just busy work and that makes me feel depressed and like I'm stuck in a rut. That thought inevitably leads to the desire to smoke the thoughts away

Anyway, hope everyone here has had a good break and is ready to make 2026 the year you take back control <3",1767173232.0,1,0,leaves,substance

1q044jv,"It took a lot of relapses to realize that withdrawal won’t be soothed by relapse. I just don’t wanna get back on the rollercoaster anymore. Notes on cannabis, nicotine, food, and running.","Addiction demands black and white thinking if moderation is off the table. I don’t believe using cannabis is entirely without value for me, but it loses its efficacy when I lose my ability to moderate, or its benefits are outnumbered by the consequences every time. Still, I don’t think it’s only bad. I eat healthy, I have a decent job, married, social, hit the gym, run 50+ miles per week, and generally feel productive despite being stoned all the time. It’s easy to excuse for months while my tolerance builds, my money dwindles, and my ambition wanes.

I also don’t think every time I’ve stopped and started again has been a failure. I’ve learned a lot over time, and more than that, I’ve changed. I’ve quit alcohol which was straight forward. I’ve quit nicotine which took dozens of attempts but lost its appeal the last time. There was thing thing where I knew it was for good. While I suffered severe withdrawal (depression) that had lasting effects for months, I understood that nicotine use wouldn’t offer relief. It would just put me back on the rollercoaster. Why did it take until quit attempt 60-something to internalize that? It was like, duh. I think, like so many things in life, time heals the wound. The iterative process can be very long, winding, and painful… especially dependency.

I’ve struggled with food in various ways since childhood, often using cannabis to dull food noise. It helped me eat when I couldn’t eat. It helped me to eat mindfully when I was binge eating. It just made me see food as fuel or a normal thing, or so I thought. I was doing okay with food, but quit using edibles about two weeks ago. Since then, my food noise has been reduced to levels I’ve never experienced. It’s perhaps how someone who doesn’t have constant thoughts of food/body feels. Very foreign. Very freeing. I eat when I’m hungry, stop when I’m full, don’t panic when I’m hungry, don’t think about food every waking moment of the day, don’t fear it, etc.

I think it’s the same concept as I experienced with nicotine but more holistic. It’s all the same rollercoaster. I want off.

Quitting nicotine (August) and cannabis (December) have been very difficult emotionally. I’m an unending well of tears and rage but I’d rather feel my feelings. I’ll get back to the equilibrium, even if it takes months. Reaching for food or cannabis or Zyn or even short-form videos, eating out, spending on credit cards (other things I quit this year) have lost appeal entirely.

Another component to this year’s success is perhaps having picked up running. I began last December and ran 2,400 miles this year. It’s an obsession which has its flaws but mostly it’s a healthy outlet. I can put all those feelings into training and it’s far less destructive and more rewarding. In addition to the replacement theory, it’s also motivating to not allow other things to interfere with my progress and fitness. I am extremely motivated by improving and racing. Sure, running is fun while high but I’m lying to myself if I think it enhances performance and performance is something I value.

I’m not naive enough to think I will feel this way every single day about every thing I mentioned, but I am hopeful that this will be the last time I quit cannabis.

(As an aside, unlike most of the heroes in this sub (I dont say this facetiously, I mean it) I have CHS so I had to quit. It was making my life a living hell. But most of you don’t have it and I’m in awe of you.) 

Anyway, about weeks 3-4 I started getting more irritable. Feeling more numb. Toward everything. Dissociating from my life. Still crying. Still somewhat  dealing with all the emotions I’ve been pushing down like divorce, loneliness even with a gf, feeling like I’ve wasted so much. 

And then last night I won my fantasy football league. Normally this would have me jumping up and down for joy. Feeling amazing. Yelling yes! and just feeling great all around. It’s kinda a big deal for me because I’ve only won it once before. 

But when I finally realized I won last night I almost didn’t care. I felt numb. Didn’t care to celebrate. Tired. Irritable. Disassociating from my life. 

Can anyone relate? Feeling great in the beginning but now just numb to the world? I want to be happy again. I want to be myself again. Yes, weed was numbing me in other way and I don’t want to go back but I also want to celebrate the victories and I just can’t seem to push myself. I don’t want to be on more meds than I’m already on (can’t say what because it violates the rules here) but I’d like to associate to my life again and I feel like I’m losing the thread.

1q00ijm,Venting,"I quit weed over 4 months ago. I didn't even initially tell anyone I was doing it, not even my bf, who I live with. I didn't ask him to stop on my behalf, he has stated in the past that he never ever would anyway. Every day I smell weed and see it in the house. It didn't bother me because it's my choice and even made me feel good about myself that I was able to overcome the temptation even with it around.

My bf has recently quit drinking. I had to give him an ultimatum after an incident in November. It was the last straw after a few incidents over the years, that always would lead to him ""cutting back"", which would never last long. He's been off alcohol completely now, which makes me happy of course. I haven't been drinking either. I'm not much of a drinker at this time in my life anyways, only having one in the last month while I was out of town.

He smokes as much, if not more than ever, as in several times throughout the day. Today he asked me to go pick up weed for him. I did not. I could have, but the request kind of annoyed me. 2 days ago he did mu*****ms (he only had a very small amount given to him by a friend). I'm starting to feel a bit resentful that while he is still having fun getting high, I'm staying completely sober, partially in support of him. I would not ask him to pick up liquor for me. I can't sit in my house and have a drink if I want (I know I could, but I'd feel guilty). 

We are staying home for New Year's because going out where everyone would be drinking would just put him in a bad mood. I understand this completely, it's still so fresh right now. I want to be supportive. But it does kind of feel like a double standard.

1q00f3y,Little Update (75 days),"Made it to 75 days and I’m happy to say so, that being said I feel like much hasn’t changed and I miss it lol. 

I guess I’m here to say that this whole journey has been a mess - especially the first couple weeks. 

I smoked weed every day from ages 16-23 and obviously regret it. When I first started it felt like the best thing in the world, and something that took the edge off. And also something I miss. 

I needed to take a drug test for a new job and decided it was time, but I smoked so much even thirty days sober required me to get clean piss from a friend that was something I wasn’t proud of - but I was still testing positive. 

75 days sober it’s much easier not to smoke, but I still miss the feeling and feel as if not much has changed. I also smoked so much where I feel like being sober is the same as being high, besides the first hour after smoking which was something I lived for. The quietness and not caring about anything, but after that hour it was stressful and anxiousness which is why I always knew deep down I needed to quit. 

I guess I’m making this post because after 2 months and a half I really don’t see the changes I thought I would while I was heavily smoking and addicted. I’m fine, but just always thought I would feel much more relief than I do now. Especially after seeing all the positive posts about people quitting and the improvements they have seen in their lives - it mostly feels the same besides the constant urge to smoke. 

I was just wondering as if anyone has felt this same way? I want to say it’s brain fog but felt like 2 and half months is something that would make this go away. I am now peeing clean and thought that once it was out of my system I would be back to normal, but still feel like I am drifting through life carelessly the same way I was when I was smoking every day. 

Maybe I permanently fucked my shit up but figured I would throw this out there. I’m also trying not to go back to it but every now and then get the urge due to the thought of “what was this all for if I feel the same”.

Instead I just feel tired and miserable. Working out every day the past week has seemed to make me more irritable, not less. Getting sunlight means going out into the cold and the wind. 

I find myself cursing under my breath at people who don't deserve it like the cashier at the grocery store when she rang my order up wrong.

1pzy3f2,I dont want to be around my friend anymore,"Throwaway account:

I quit weed back in August after being a fairly regular user for a couple years (up and down in waves) because I got the job of my dreams but it requires a security clearance. That means no weed, none, zilch. Plus you need to be sober for a while BEFORE even applying (for a clearance). And the full process can take up to 15 MONTHS.

  
Obviously I wasn't going to throw away my career over pot so I quit. And then my life started getting better, since I had to substitute the high the that weed gave me for sober alternatives.

  
I quickly turned to running... an old forgotten friend. Sure I hated it initially, but at the end of a run it was like mental nirvana. I became obsessed with getting stronger and bettering myself for my own health, and to be thankful to be alive and healthy. Thoughts of weed still enter my mind, but then I think about how happy/healthy I am; then those thoughts fade.

To get to the point, I got my closest friend high for his first time. Ever since then we have grown as people together and wouldn't have changed it for the world.

But... now he is smoking daily and makes up all sorts of shit about how he needs it to sleep or whatever (sometimes claiming it helps him study supposedly) and self medicates. This was never really a problem because who am I to talk?  
  
So fast forward to last week, I went over to his house and he's stoned out of his mind with his friends, and talking to him is like bricks on my feet. I was starting to feel like we could only relate to each other while both sober or both high, and I was not high. So I was sitting there as the friend group was passing the bong around and respectfully declining but some part of me did long for it because its an easy way out to feeling good. 

But I declined, and then the longing quickly turned to disgust as I felt like I was not meant to be here, it was an out of body experience. Particularly when a girl in the group that I was seeing (who, mind you, went on and on every time we hung out one on one about how much she doesn't want to smoke weed) took a hit. And I quickly stood up and said ""I have to go my dad needs me for something at the house."" and left and it was clear the girl knew something was wrong and followed me out to my car and asked what was wrong. I told her I just didnt want to be there anymore and she begged me to stay. I then got in my car and drove home and went on a 5 mile run and felt happy with having done something productive having witnessed the bong circle.

Don't get me wrong I dont think weed is all bad, for chronic pain etc I think it is a miracle. But truthfully I just am sad that one of my closest friends I feel I cant associate with in the same way because of weed and its just annoying.

1pzvhq5,One year after a weed induced panic attack triggered the worst OCD flare up of my life.,"Hi everyone, I just wanted to share my story in case it helps someone. It does have a happy ending. I know when I was in the thick of this, I was desperate to hear stories like mine that ended well, because there were days I was sure that I had wrecked my brain. 

I'm currently 29F and had been a cannabis user for 5 years prior to this episode, with heavy daily use for around 3 years of that. I had a history of OCD but otherwise, high functioning with no history of mental health issues. I loooooved weed. I loved how it made my body feel, I loved sex on weed, I loved exercise on weed. I loved painting and listening to music on weed, I loved eating on weed. All the things you probably loved about it, too. I was a part of subcultures where weed smoking is not just the norm, but expected (jiu-jitsu, EDM, Colorado hiking, etc.) and never had any reason to quit. Weed did not make me lazy, either, I achieved a lot of ""traditional successes"" while being high every day. In 2024, I began to taper down the THC concentration of my products. I did this for multiple reasons - firstly, I noticed that I had developed uncharacteristically intense emotions - I began to feel things, especially negative emotions, much more intensely than I remembered. Things would bother me, and I'd ruminate and obsess over them. Second reason was that I was beginning a prestigious PHD program and didn't want my cognitive abilities to be hindered by being high all day. Thirdly, I realized that being high all the time made me kind of spineless. I had put up with some serious abuse in a gym I was part of, and had allowed a friend of mine to treat me and other friends of mine like dirt. Setting boundaries with people was impossible while high. 

End of December 2024, I got a free joint and didn't read the label, it had concentrates added to flower. I smoked half of it alone in an environment that I wasn't comfortable in sober, and that I couldn't leave. Immediately, I had the feeling that something was wrong. I had never had anxiety, paranoia, or any negative side effect from cannabis ever before aside from nausea from overeating. I descended into a 6 hour long panic attack of pure agony, heart racing and trembling, the only the emotion I felt was DOOM. Nothing could comfort me - nothing I watched, read, or thought could distract me from the terror. I began to have intrusive thoughts about losing control of myself - What if I ""snapped"" and killed myself? What if I hurt someone else? which only terrified me more. I came down from the high but did not feel any better, I was legit traumatized. All I could think about was the feeling of pure terror, and how I absolutely had to make sure it could never happen again.

I stopped weed cold turkey, but still continued to suffer intrusive thoughts about my mental health, my potential to be dangerous, and even sillier things like ""my relationships would be a sham if I didn't admit every wrong thing I've ever done to my partner"" or ""snapping"" and shouting obscenities at my neighbors. These are all classic OCD, which I have had my entire life, even prior to ever touching weed. I never received treatment because it was so mild, but this experience ramped my OCD to severe. I stopped sleeping, because my hypnagogic hallucinations made me think I was schizophrenic. My nightmares from sobriety began to traumatize me. I stopped eating, because of my fear of choking on food. Two weeks after my big panic attack, I checked myself into a psych ward out of the genuine fear that I was going to snap and hurt myself or someone else. Looking back now, I did not need to go, but I met some cool people there and finally got to eating/sleeping. I was given some mild anti-anxiety drugs and got connected with a therapist. I was only diagnosed with OCD and PTSD, both of which I knew I had (I experienced some horrific stuff in the past few years that I had stuffed down with my weed use). 

The next three months were me battling with OCD and constant anxiety - my life was a mess of emotional dysregulation (crying constantly) and suffering through intrusive thoughts. I refused to let it claim my life, though. I went to work and grad school, I exercised, and I saw friends, even if I would break down crying in the bathroom. Life did not slow down when I was suffering - I had to navigate some intense family problems in the thick of this, while doing my PHD program. I tried a few different medications, none of which seemed to help for more than a day or two, so I quit them. Life became bearable around month 3, I began living more like my old self around months 5-6 (vacations, music festivals, etc.) and had the first days where I felt like old me around month 8. Unfortunately, I had a huge setback at month 8 with an unplanned pregnancy and loss. I got through it sober, which would've been unthinkable to the old me. I've had no real cravings and no relapses - the original panic attack has scared me so bad, I'd like to never be in that space again.  
  
Now, I'm at 12 months sober and I feel mentally like myself again. I feel much more emotionally stable, I don't cry much anymore. Most importantly - I look forward to things and can feel excited again. I also feel confident in my ability to manage OCD as I go through therapy for it. Sometimes I miss the carefree naivety of life when I used to get high every day, but I realize that the feeling I had then is just a lie from weed and real life will happen anyway, the good and the bad. 

If any of this sounds familiar, here is what I recommend. Anxiety and OCD thrive on avoidance - the way to get your life back from them is to do things even while terrified. Keep busy but take care of your health. Hang out with people even if being around them doesn't take away the terror you feel. Getting your brain chemistry back after years of heavy use also may take awhile, don't be discouraged if you feel weird 6 months out or even longer. Don't be afraid to try interventions like therapy and medication - weed is a crutch and can hide mental health problems until it forces them out in the open. Medication didn't do much for me but therapy (specifically OCD therapy) has really helped me understand and manage my OCD. 

Anyway, I hope someone finds this helpful, and I am always happy to provide details or give recommendations via comment or DM, especially about managing OCD. Best of luck everyone, you got this!",1767133017.0,3,3,leaves,substance
1pzuq5t,3 weeks sober,"Hi all, 23f here & I quit smoking weed about 3 weeks ago.

Being honest, I had no intention to quit but suffered a horrendous panic attack and I’ve had no desire to smoke since & want to use this opportunity to quit for good.

I suffer with horrendous anxiety as of the past two years, been smoking since I was 16 & been smoking a Q a week since 18 (likely caused the anxiety if I’m being honest).

I don’t drink (allergic to alcohol and I’m on prescription medication so couldn’t if I wanted to), but I’m worried about having no vice at all. Weed for a very long time was my only way of relaxing but due to these panic attacks, I don’t think I’ll ever go back, even if I wanted to.

I know I’ll struggle when I return home as my flat mate and all my friends smoke, but the fear of a panic attack will override that.

I was just hoping people could leave some advice? Did you feel better once you smoked? Any hobbies/activities that helped continue quitting? Any healthy “vices” you recommend? I’m determined to get my life back in more ways than one but I am worried about giving into it again. I don’t crave it right now, but once I see others doing it I fear I will.

1pzucs2,24 hours in,"I gave in to my desires today and boight a gramm of hash. It's illegal where I'm from so I had to order a dead drop online. I didn't find my stuff. Spent about 20 minutes on my hands and knees in the snow, freezing my fingers numb, and as I started no longer feeling my pinky finger I gave up and went home without my weed. In highnsight I understand that it's a good thing. A fluke that saved my sorry ass from failure. I am now at home, trying to reason with myself that even tho I've wasted my money, the end result is still the same: I have nothing and I feel miserable. No use crying over it.
As I was going home, I started sobbing. I know it's the mood swings affecting me, bit it doesn't make it easier. At one point while trying to calm myself I've started asking ""why are we crying"" over and over again, untill I sobbed out loud ""I wanna smoke weed"". And as the phrase left my mouth I felt like I was plunged deep into ice cold water or something. Admitting it out loud instead of my usual ""My back hurts"" or ""I'm so tired"" or ""I wanna forget about my problems"" made me feel disgusted with myself. I don't wanna be a person who only wants to smoke weed in life. I'm so scared. I have nothing else. I don't want anything and I have no reasons to live. I've started smoking all those years ago to treat my accute suicidal ideation and now I'm scared that it'll get worse now that I'm not numb. I don't know which parts of my emotions are the withdrawals, which are the mental health issues and where my real feelings are burried. My pinky is still numb and hurts a lot, I can't stop crying, my thoughts keep swinging between wanting to die, hating myself, wanting to go back outside and keep digging in dirt and snow, shame, anxiety and idk what else. And yet at the same time it feels like my body is crying just for the sake of crying. One moment it's dread and misery, the next I feel nothing. Been crying for the past hour or so non stop. I know it will get so much worse tomorrow and I'm not ready. But at the same time, if I do smoke now I will not only waste more money but I will also be going through all that again. I NEED to quit but I don't want to. I hate the fatigue, hate the nausea, hate coughing up my lungs, searchinh for dead drops in the night, always smelling like shit, being overweight despite barely eating all day, I hate binge eating at nights, hate my GI issues, hate hate hate everything.

I really need to want it, but I can't convince myself that I won't just end it all, crushed by withdrawals.

Loads of emotions came to the forefront and I was crying easily, getting very upset and angry with myself on how I’ve wasted so many opportunities due to being a lifetime stoner (started when I was 10 and I’m 35 now). I also had terrible night sweats and disturbed sleep. 

Days 14-21 were better and by day 21 I thought I’d turned a corner. My appetite had come back and I’ve started sleeping better. I started to feel relatively normal, although still tired, and had a few good gym sessions. 

But the last 4-5 days or so I’ve had a crushing depression and I just feel awful. It’s not that I miss cannabis, that part of my life is over now and I will never touch that crap again. I just want to feel normal. 

My friends and family don’t really understand. I don’t want to get on psychiatric meds. I’ve forced myself to the exercise a couple of times but it’s not really helping. 

I hate myself for putting this drug in my body for the past 25 years and thinking it was ok. I’m in tears now as I write this. I can’t stop being upset with the damage I’ve done to myself. 

To anyone else who’s been through this, is this normal and when can I expect to feel better ? I did an at home urine test last night and there’s still THC in my system. I’m guessing my brain needs to renormalise after so many years of abuse…",1767109941.0,4,9,leaves,substance

1pzknsb,day 9. feel evil. remembering my history.,"i'm on day 9 of sobriety (i'm 27, spent the last 10 years high) and i've been trying to process my emotions and realizing a huge reason i've been smoking so much is that i'm not allowed to show negative emotions at home.

i've been grumpy and mildly irritated by everything, and my mom has been asking me constantly if i'm mad at her and acting like i'm going to rip her head off when all i've done is have a mildly annoyed tone with her once or twice. 

even my dad is doing it. ""is it okay if i walk through here?"" in the most Overly Concerned tone. i've reassured them that they're fine and i'm not mad at them but the constant asking and tiptoeing around me is actually starting to piss me off.

i've also been remembering a lot about my teen years that i've been repressing and realizing that every time i expressed anything other than happiness or compliance, i was strip searched for self harm marks. (i did self harm but being stripped naked did not help and actually made it worse and just made me better at hiding everything from them). even as an adult my mom pulled the ""you seem really sad lately i think i should check you..."" and yelled at me when i stripped naked with the door open.

i had no sense of privacy growing up and was my mom's therapist. i was 8 sitting on her bed while she told me about her relationship problems with my dad. i would give her advice. she had me parent her. i still do. 

she would tag me into their arguments and made me yell at him for her. (he was trying to get her to stop her wasteful spending).

am i crazy for still being upset by all this? i dont know how to be a human anymore or what emotions i'm supposed to be feeling. i don't know how i'm supposed to not be angry, i love my parents and they're good people who love me but being around them makes me want to rip my skin off. i'm always on edge around them now that i can't dumb myself down and be too numb to care that i've been physically humiliated and parentified.

what the fuck do i do? i don't know how to do this.

plus the dreams. fucking kill me

1pzkfck,"Day 1, again. Starting to lose hope.","I'll be 23 tomorrow. I know I'm still young, but I feel like I've missed out on so much. I've been smoking since I was 15. I've cut down significantly since then; when I was 17, 18, and 19, I smoked all day, every day. I don't remember a whole lot from those years. I developed a serious problem during the pandemic. March 2020 through May 2023 is a blur. I've been trying to quit entirely since last year, and it seems like every time I try I just ... can't? At best, I've made it 1.5 months. And then the little voice in my head says ""it's not so bad, you like to smoke, just go for it."" 

It's not like I've ruined my life. I have a good social life, I'm in a semi-popular local band, I have a good job, a girlfriend that I love very much, a nice apartment in a city that I like. But there's this feeling that I'm *not here.* I don't know if this makes any sense. I feel outside of my body. Like my life is happening to me and I don't have anything to do with it. And I'm terrified that this will be how it is forever; that I'll never be able to get a handle on it, and that one day I'll wake up and wonder how I got here? Who made all these decisions, anyway? 

But then there's a certain embarrassment, because weed seems so benign. I've had friends who were addicted to other, more ""serious"" things. I've seen their lives fall apart *magnificently.* And so I can't help but compare myself to those folks, and say to myself that what I'm dealing with isn't that bad, it pales in comparison, everyone smokes weed, what's the big deal? Am I so spineless and weak willed that *this* of all things is fucking me up so bad? Is it fucking me up, anyway? On the surface, I'm relatively put together. It's just that I feel so empty and absent. Like I'm spectating my life. 

I don't really know where I'm going with this post. I caved last night, and I woke up feeling quite ashamed and sad. I don't know if I'll ever be able to kick this habit, and I'm scared. Doesn't help that I'm 23 tomorrow; I hate my birthday, generally. And 23 feels like a significant one, somehow. So that's scary, too. Extra unfortunate that my birthday happens to be New Years' Eve.

This is my second serious attempt. I have 6 weeks. First time was three months. I caved the first time due to the inability to manage my emotions and the constant fear of having to go to sleep. 

Every single night. Nightmares. Horrible scenarios. To the point where I’m only getting 4 hours max if I’m lucky because I can’t handle what my subconscious is doing. My anxiety is through the roof. I’m living every waking moment in a state of panic. Like someone is sitting on my chest. 

I know this can go on for at least three months. How much longer do I have to deal with this? Even my mother said why don’t you just use a low dose of edible cannabis, because I really want my lung health back, because she seems to think there’s no solution.

1pzj4ln,day 8 struggling with emotions,"hi, 29F and longtime everyday smoker – this morning marks day 8, which is the longest i’ve went by my own choosing. if i travel and don’t smoke i generally feel fine, because im having fun and life is good. my problem is that i felt i cannot function in my everyday life without. can’t overcome stress, cant sleep, cant get into “off” mode (probs an ADD thing). felt okay the first few days, it was over the holidays and i went to my sisters house to spend christmas with her kiddos (3.5 & 6mos). 

i am shocked at the amount of emotion flooding into me and truly do not know how to process it. i didn’t realize just how much weed was numbing me in that way. i knew it was making me lazy, isolated, eat terrible, etc – but i have been crying, stressing, just overall feeling quite unstable! my flight home was cancelled and i was freaaaking out, spiraling into an anxiety attack, while usually i can deal with hurdles and think logically and go with the flow. but what really surprised me is how many times i would cry from things my nephew would say, like “can i come in your suitcase? i’m small i can fit! i don’t want you to go away!” instant waterworks, and i have NEVER been a crier especially during happy/sweet moments.

i literally felt like the grinch when his heart grows three sizes and he says “Help me! I’m FEELING! And i’m leaking🥲” gaahhh it feels so weird. i feel unpredictable and vulnerable and unstable, although i will say i also feel a lot more clear headed and it feels like im having some inspiration and motivation return to my life. anyone else on an emotional rollercoaster?

1pzj1cq,Just hit 6 months clean last week after nearly a decade of chronic use,"It feels good to have this milestone, but am looking forward to 1 year. Starting smoking multiple times a week which then became daily back in college. Would keep this frequency most of college and then kept it once I graduated. I’d take the occasional breaks for a few weeks or even a month or so but would get back to daily use until I finally recognized I was using it as an escape and the high/euphoria I used to get was no longer there. 

That’s when I started trying to “quit” but would fail because of how accessible it was. My group of friends would always have it whenever we’d be together. It went hand in hand with drinking when we’d go out or celebrate some occasion.

I recognized my habit stayed because I kept chasing that feeling of having fun or being positive because it was so closely associated with good times/laughter with friends, but I was numbing myself.

After countless half-hearted attempts (e.g. I joined this sub years ago), this time around I really began trying to strongly associate the negative effects I was having with smoking to create an aversion to it. Not buying more as well as giving or throwing away what I had left were the last things I needed to for me to finally commit to quitting cold turkey over the summer. In part to prove to myself that I could, but mainly because I felt I needed to give my body and mind a break. The anxiety I started developing sucked.

Part of me wishes I did so sooner, but now I’m just glad to have gotten over a major hump (at least I hope so) of the cravings to do it once more. Knowing myself, I know this was the slippery slope that kept me going back to becoming a daily smoker. 

For now I’m just telling my friends that still smoke that I’m taking a break and wanting to see how long I can last. Maybe I’ll smoke again in the future but for now, I’m happy to have it not be a part of my life.

I’ve been working remotely for years but I start a new job, in person, in 2 weeks. I don’t know how the hell I’m supposed to get through the day without smoking.

I also have bad GI issues - even with the weed I’ll feel nauseous and have awful stomach pains. Working with a doctor on that but nothing has helped.

I need guidance. My husband doesn’t know how to support me without lashing out, which I understand why, but it doesn’t help me.

1pzcrcy,Feeling hopeful for new years,"Lately, I’ve actually been feeling okay. Not amazing, not fixed, but genuinely better than I have in a while.



I’ve had a lot of really shit days. Most mornings I wake up thinking I’ve wasted so much time and potential, wondering why I even keep going. But I’ve been mentally preparing myself, keeping expectations low, and focusing on just getting through the day.



I quit weed. I quit Instagram. I quit my shit job. I have no idea what the fuck I’m doing next. I’m lonelier than I’ve been in years, dating apps are rough, and I’m still figuring out who I even am. That part hasn’t magically gotten easier.



What has helped is realizing that even on bad days, if I can do one or two small things, like cleaning my room, tidying my office, or grabbing groceries, it gives me a sense of accomplishment. It reminds me that this is worth it, even when motivation is low.



I’m also feeling more confident about getting through New Year’s. I was anxious because I’m going to a party where I know there will be weed and a couple stoners there, but honestly, it doesn’t feel like a big deal. I’ve made a plan. I’m going from one party to another, pacing my drinks, and I have an exit strategy if I need it. More importantly, I know why I’m not going back.



When I really think about it, it’s not just wasted time or potential that I grieve. I’m still in my mid-twenties, I still have time, creativity, and ambition, and if anything, I’ve become more creative and driven this year, even while I was smoking. What hurts more are the missed connections and misaligned opportunities that came from being in the middle of addiction. I’ve been chasing real, authentic connection, and weed kept pulling me away from that. That’s why I know I will not touch it at this party. It is just not what I want anymore.



One thing that’s helped a lot is reading this forum. Seeing other people talk about the same feelings, regret, loneliness, rebuilding, has made me feel less alone. Being around active stoners can really mess with my head, but coming here reminds me I’m not broken or uniquely fucked. A lot of us are in the same boat, trying to reconnect with ourselves and others.



I even had a dream about doing a drag show. I’ve always wanted to try drag, and I woke up thinking, fuck it, 2026 is the year. I’m going to get out of the house, try new things, and stop giving energy to people who drain me.



I still don’t know what job I’m doing next year. I still feel insecure as hell sometimes. But I have more self respect now, and I know what energy I deserve. For the first time in a while, I feel hopeful, and that feels huge.



Thanks for being here.

I'll be copying this into my quitting journal tonight, so I can reread it and remind myself. 

I've thrown all my smoking gear out, 2 weeks ago, my dealer was arrested and that was enough for me to finally see the reality of what I stand to lose if I don't quit. I have a steady job - cleaning houses for over 65s who are living independently, it's a surprisingly satisfying job, I get paid to exercise and I'm making a difference in so many homes. I clean up to 3 houses a day, 4 days a week - most of my clients are lovely people and they do absolute wonders for my self esteem, I'm welcome in their homes and they look forward to my visits.

I'm starting a certificate 4 in mental health in the new year, I've got hip surgery coming up in about 6 months or so, and I want to give myself the best chance at studying and physically recovering from major surgery next year. I've been saving the money I'd normally spend and I've got a plan for it that doesn't involve getting wasted.

In other words i feel like the most responsible adult I've felt in a long time. My bills are paid, I've got food in the fridge and a little savings account growing nicely. 

I've not slept in 2 nights. I'm beyond exhausted. Two nights ago it was 30°C overnight, roughly 86°Freedom Fahrenheits, after a day of 40°C/104°F, and I expected to sweat that one fully conscious. Last night wasn't quite so hot, but sleep escaped me again. I tried to nap when I got home from work this afternoon, but my body aches and I'm rotating in bed like a pig on a spit. 

I'm also perimenopausal, so sweat just seems to be part of who I am at the moment. I honestly can't tell if I'm hot flushing, withdrawal sweating or combo. I would literally pay for 90 minutes sleep. My appetite is still struggling, I'm eating one or two meals a day. If anyone has tips on how to sleep, please share.

I realized that the sobriety fatigue was the main thing causing me to relapse early in the attempts. I didn't even realize that the sobriety itself made me fatigued until the last attempt failed! I just thought I felt tired and would then use edibles to energize me. This time I quit in time for the weekend, and prepared myself to take a bunch of 15min breaks to lie down and rest my eyes. I even chose podcasts to listen to so I can get some delight in the rest, instead of moping in how shot my energy was.

I'm finally past the worst of the fatigue, and am now on the look out for the next thing that trips me up, and the disease is already trying to plant the idea in my head using my voice: ""you've done a lot, you can use to relax and in pride."" 

My desire to quit comes from me putting off doing things like house cleaning, hygiene, grocery shopping, gym and advanced hobby work. When I get sober I get back on track.

Made it to week 8 (56 days since last use). Been somewhat of a tougher week, and I suspect the holidays might have something to do with it. Truthfully, I kind of feel as weird and anxious as I did week 1 or so. I’m in the middle of a move too so I have lots of extracurriculars going on. Oddly enough, I don’t really want to smoke again despite how I feel.

So what I’ve noticed:

\- I am enjoying sex again. I think about how strong an orgasm is while high, but I don’t miss it anymore during

\- The dreams are on and off weird, not consistently weird.

\- I feel more motivated and less like I am floating through. I picked up reading and running gives me an endorphin rush again

\- ugh the weight gain! Up 8 lbs. Metabolism is much slower. I ate not well when I smoked and haven’t really changed habits (exercise included). Gotta work on that.

\- Less explosively irritable. Mood is generally better.

Just keeping on yall. Stay strong! At the end of these thoughts, I just remind myself that even though it’s not perfect, there are positive changes and that the point isn’t for everything to be amazing. The point is to not be owned by cravings and dopamine seeking.

I'm ready to quit. I've taken breaks long enough to know that I feel, think, and act better when I'm totally sober. I'm 36, about to start my first grown-up job since having my son, and preparing to go back to school to finish my undergrad and then study law. I know that I will be able to tackle all these things so much more competently and confidently without smoking. I understand the benefits and recognize the downside of being high while it's happening. 

The problem? Dreams. So many fucked up, complicated, vivid, feels-like-I-lived-a-lifetime-in-one-night kind of dreams. Not even nightmares necessarily, but incredibly mentally and emotionally demanding scenarios played out over and over and over again without resolution. 

I'm a single mom because when my son was an infant I finally left an abusive marriage (he smoked heavily and my smoking habit got significantly worse during our relationship, I had been sober for years when I met him). When I'm not smoking I see my abuser in my dreams every night. I argue with him, I run from him, I physically fight him over and over. He hasn't been in my real life for years but when I dream like this I feel haunted by him.

It ends up getting to the point that I wake up more worn out than I was when I went to bed. I feel so drained by all the 'effort' I'm spending in my dreams that I go back to smoking as a way to escape them.

1pz5twc,Day 11 or 12 idk,"I'm not really keeping track of how long its been for me. I just know its been \~11 days now.  
I'm male, 6ft, 330-ish pounds and smoked almost daily for the last 5 years at least. Distillates REALLY heavily the last like 8 months.  
  
The first few days were really bad - I had an intense anxiety attack, palpitations, the works.  
It has since evened out into mild constipation/stomach issues and anxiety/tightness of the abdomen. Not much palpitation stuff except for when I start feeling the anxiety more and it makes my chest tighten.  
  
I've been trying to keep drinking lots of water and less soda/sugar/caffeine. I went on a 1 1/2 mile walk just now (its made me feel quite weird atm, but I never exercise, so hey who knows?).  
I even got myself a set of no-nic pens (that have NOT arrived yet...) to help myself with the habit of smoking something so eventually I don't need it. I don't know if it'll help.

If I was dying from this or had heart complications due to it - I'm sure they would have taken me or forced me to the hospital before now, so I *think* that my issues are mainly psychological and physiological more than actual issues - but its HARD to not assume it is.

I'm making a doctors appointment tomorrow as I haven't been in at least 5 years (I was tired of them just calling me a fat bastard every time so I stopped going - which is also not a great thing)

I just...I don't know? Everyone keeps saying their withdrawal and other symptoms lasted SO LONG yet I feel I am already seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and evening back out. Maybe it will come in waves. Some days might be better than others.

1pyzw24,Weed ruined my fucking life.,"Weed didn’t ruin my life overnight.  


It started as fun.  
  
Then it became a coping mechanism for childhood stuff I didn’t know how to process.   
  
Then it became the background noise of my entire existence.

I spent most of my 20s high.  
  
College especially.  
  
Living in abstraction. Floating. Getting by doing the bare minimum. Escaping through the night, escaping constantly, avoiding thoughts of the future. Avoiding true responsibility. 

They told me it wasn't addictive, harmless, etc. So fun snoop dogg seth rogen haha ya! 

It's been the most brutal addiction experience of my life (and i've tried it all) 

My ambition dulled.  
My intelligence flattened.  
My sleep got worse.  
My confidence eroded. 

It made me a less honest person, it made me hedonistic and dopamine driven. It made me fucking lazy and pathetic. 

I used to look down on alcohol in college. Look at me, no hangovers, and I thought I was so smart, like I have this crazy perspective from being high and this and that. 

  
But at least people drinking are *in the world*.  
  
Networking. Dating. Taking risks. Building something.

I was numb. Isolated. Safe. Small.

Now I’m almost 29.  
Friends have built companies, families, lives.  
I’m still trying to assemble adulthood from scratch.

I’ve quit more times than I can count.  
And somehow I always go back, even knowing it leads to depression, shame, and suicidal thoughts.

That’s what addiction actually looks like.  
Not chaos.  
Slow mediocrity.

I grieve my 20s. I'm so ashamed of what I let happen. I'm so disturbed guys seriously. I've contemplated killing myself.   
  
I have one more chance, thats the entrance to my thirties to establish myself as a serious person, to myself and to the world. 

My only path forward is full sobriety from this fucking satanic substance.   
  
Not only at night ""after i get my work done"".   


I've tried it all, every method, only weekends only nights only this only that. It turns into daily and into mediocrity every fucking time. 10 years of this retarded cycle. 

I’m posting this because pretending this was “fine” almost killed me.

1pyxbef,100 Days Without Weed,"Today is officially 100 days that I have been off marijuana. This is the longest I’ve ever gone choosing to be off of it. After a few relapses in 2025 I finally reached a point where I was very ready and very excited to quit. The time has flown by and it really hasn’t been that hard to stop this time because I remember how low I was at the end and how much I thought my life sucked and the horrible thoughts I was having. I’m happy that I don’t really think like that anymore.  
  
What is annoying is that now it’s been about three months and I can feel the thoughts arising about doing it again or planning a time when I might do it again. I find myself thinking about whether it could be some time next year or during some low point where I take a couple months off sobriety and just smoke all the time. And I know exactly what would happen. I would gain weight. I would stop exercising. My meds would stop working. I would socially isolate. All of that feels very obvious to me.  
  
Weed is so psychoactive now that it feels more like a trippy experience and I hate that. I hate the weird thoughts I have when I’m high. It feels unsettling. At the same time there is still something I miss about how weed used to feel. I have a desire to do it again while also not wanting to at all because I know exactly what I’m getting into and it doesn’t even seem appealing anymore.  
  
It reminds me of “trippy drugs”. I used to love “trippy drugs”. I loved the visuals and the way it changed how I thought and saw things. Now I feel almost terrified at the idea of doing it. I feel like I would freak myself out and have a bad trip even though I’m thirteen years older now. It is less about wanting to do drugs again and more about remembering the feelings I had back then and wishing I could still feel that way now in my thirties, while knowing I probably can’t.  
  
I think I am grieving. I am grieving my childhood and my drug ridden years when I felt comfortable with it all. Now I feel very uncomfortable when I do drugs. I hate the thoughts I have. It feels weird and unsettling. I have accepted that this isn’t something I can/should go back to.

1pyhbr6,I hope this helps someone in my situation : I discovered the psychological phenomenon of 'heightened self-monitoring' lastnight and I think anyone in post-acute withdrawal should know about it,"Today is day 20 for me (which I acknowledge is still early days and not long enough for neurological recalibration to happen) but I discovered lastnight the concept of self-checking and how it functions as a 'meta-cognitive distortion'. In effect, constantly beng concerned about your own mental performance and intellectual capacities will make those same capacities that you're closely watching worse, which just makes you watch them closer and the loop reinforces itself.

Turns out that your performance is seriously harmed during recovery if you engage in (1) monitoring your internal mental contents and processes and scrutinise every little lapse; (2) comparing your current circumstance to an idealised version of yourself that was never addicted; (3) interpret the combonation of natural fluctuations and mental noise during recovery as evidence that you are broken, then this is getting in the way of the recovery that you're watching too closely. 

What's worse is trying to monitor your cognition and mental noise and evaluating it and criticising yourself when it isn't perfect uses your executive function and drains it really quickly. Again, the irony is that this executive function would perform better if you'd just leave it alone. 

Imagine that you are trying to tutor someone playing piano and you are sat on their lap watching closely their every move and lamenting over every small error they make.

This might sound obvious to some but this last two weeks is the first time I've ever dealt with this and I didn't even know there was research in clinical psychology into this concept. Just learning about it and gaining an understanding of it has made me feel better.

I've already learnt from quitting that one change is unlikely to stoke massive growth, but I am really excited to implement a new protocol where I ignore constant self-checking in favour of one small practice in the evening where I objectively measure if I completed the tasks that I wanted to today and how I feel compared to this time last week.

1pyejul,"How are you improving your memory, active listening, emotional regulation, and communications skills after smoking heavily for years?","I 33F started smoking weed recreationally around 23 years old. My habit grew over the years to every day smoking by the time I was about 26. After that I smoked multiple times a day and heavily so I was always high.

I was very creative and my memory was pretty good (despite having ADHD) but now, I will have a conversation with my significant other and forget part of my side of the conversation or theirs just minutes afterward and I cannot bring my point full circle or recall what he said completely.

My relationship with my partner has suffered so much because he thinks I don’t use my brain and that I am not reliable.

Coworkers think I’m an idiot because I have to be taught things again and again.

My personal and professional relationships have suffered. They all think I am incapable or lazy.

My processing time is slower and I cannot remember the meaning or the spelling of some words I have known since grade school.

Because my emotional IQ has plummeted and I have become so emotionally overwhelmed when I feel triggered about these things, I cry uncontrollably or I get defensive and try to figure out how the issue I have created is not my fault after I have messed something up because I cannot handle my self-loathing over not being able to concentrate or retain important information anymore.

I feel like the real me died along with the parts of my brain that I fried and I cannot see how I will forgive myself because I know I would not be having these cognitive issues if I had never smoked.

From June 2024-August 2025, I significantly cut back, going from smoking twice a week to a couple times a month, then once every few months. 

It has been four months since the last time I smoked.

I have gone back to college while working so I am proud of that but… without the support of my partner in all other aspects of my life, I would be incapable of taking care of myself overall.

I am just…so scared and it is worse because I feel like no one in my life understands what I am 

going through.

How did you manage to improve your memory?

Were you able to return to the cognitive ability level  that you were at before you smoked or it became a problem?

How did you overcome any emotional dysregulation side effects from sobriety?

How did you improve your communication skills?

1py4b7q,Feeling conflicted,"10 year smoker, have taken many breaks over the last few years. Currently on week four of sobriety. The first three weeks was totally sober, but the last week, I’ve had a few drinks everyday to deal with being with the in laws for the holidays (always a hard time for me) and smoked a tiny bit of tobacco. When I smoke the tobacco, I know it’s not what I really want. 

I’ve been doing okay for the most part but my husband has had a hard time dealing with my volatile emotional state, reflecting that I’ve been worried or fearful over anything and every thing else. This obviously has affected our connection. He was sober with me up until a few days ago, when he smoked again. There’s so much I enjoy about being sober and not a slave to the plant. But we are hosting a big NYE party at our homestead, where all of our friends are camping for three days. There will be all kinds of activities going on there and I know it’ll be tough not to smoke with my college friends that are coming out of state to be with us. 

I guess I’m just upset because if it’s not one addiction, it’s another (scrolling, shopping, eating). It seems like modern society is rigged for addiction and suffering. I want to just choose peace but I’ve been really down these weeks, even though I know the break has been worth it. I also feel unvalued by my job (boss has been holding a well deserved raise over my head for a long time) and I know its temporary relief but it feels like I’m damned if I do and damned if I don’t.

1py3sqk,Almost had 1 year sober... now I'm back at day 1,"I quit last year around the end of October, and I did so well all the way up to September, barely even craved it those 11 months despite it still being smoked by family in the house.. but I broke my streak in September and bought a preroll at my local dispensary. I told myself it was just going to be the one, but I was so stressed at the time that it just felt really good to settle into that fog and forget all my problems for a while.

But like I knew deep down it would, it started a spiral downward where all the momentum I had gained for tackling other areas of my life slowly started disappearing. I bought another preroll a week later, then a couple more when that ran out. I stopped stretching, I gave up cooking my meals and went back to eating junk and easy to make meals more often. My body feels so exhausted and weak now that I'm not eating right and smoking every hour, my mind is so foggy and slow to express my thoughts, and my emotions are numb again. I bought a bong and I threw it out a few weeks ago in a fit of rage over my choices to keep smoking, then I bought another one a few days later.

Christmas was really hard. During my relapse, my 12yr relationship ended. That was almost three weeks ago, and while smoking wasn't the reason, it was an underlying issue that contributed to so many of my worst traits and habits over the years that definitely were part of the reasons. I let so many years pass me by in a blur because I was too afraid of facing everything, including myself..

But I don't like feeling so tired again, so closed off and numb. I want to sleep and feel rested! I want to feel good inside my body, and I want to feel my hard emotions and do the work to process, heal, and truly grow into my next phase of life. 

Thank you to this group of people, for if I never found this sub I fear I wouldn't have hope in quitting this for good. You're all amazing and I wish you all the best!

i worked a double at my restaurant job and came home to no one, nothing. my roommate went home for Christmas, my brother, his wife and kid are staying at mine but they left to a cousin's birthday party before i got home from work.

 my life has definitely improved since i quit. i cut bad people out my life, im smarter with money, i finally get to dream at night again.

 after a rough shift or day i still get the itch, and when my coworkers offer me a hit, sometimes i hesitate..but it's easier to ignore it now. i still get headaches when i smell it, but now it's a smell that's attached to bad memories instead of making me wish i could smoke again.

i guess it's not a big deal, life goes on, but at least i can say im proud of myself. i know they're proud of me too, but it'd be nice to hear it.

I stopped enjoying it years ago but couldn’t bring myself to quit. It’s like a part of me, but also something that’s been holding me back.

At the start of October, I had my last bong. I tried joints for a while, but they didn’t do anything, I still felt sober. Then, 12 days ago, I went abroad for 5 nights. I smoked once while there, but it wasn’t worth it. It made me see how much time and energy I waste, not just for myself but for everyone around me, so I threw my remainders away. Quitting there ended up being far easier than I ever imagined.
 
Back home, I started again, but I’ve set strict rules, no smoking before 4:20. I now feel joints more after my tolerance break but I don’t enjoy the high anymore. Smoking actually makes me feel depressed. It’s controlled so much of my life, and I just want it gone. I’m 31, and it’s all I’ve ever known.

I’ve noticed eating helps, skipping meals makes cravings worse and boredom os the hardest to overcome. I also smoke more tobacco now which sucks but on a positve note some days I manage to wait until 7/8pm. The 4:20 rule is my minimum.

7 months I smoked, ended up in a ‘relationship’ I didn’t really want but I was high and it was convenient. When that fell apart I realised how easy/comfortable it was to be high but how out of control I was with myself, I hated who I was because I stopped working on myself and I was just on autopilot. 

When I quit again in September it was as if there was a switch and I was really done with smoking weed, I faced an even more difficult situation completely sober where I learnt how to sit and feel my emotions fully rather than avoiding/numbing them for the first time in my life (that sucked), I even smoked occasionally with friends and I didn’t fall back into regularly smoking and now I don’t count the days I’m sober because I don’t think about weed like how I use to.

when i quit smoking i thought life would suddenly be good. how wrong i was. i missed numbing myself. i missed being basically a vegetable. i missed not having to think about the future. and now i have all these thoughts, all these regrets, all these mistakes i made when i was younger and not sober and no drug to distract me. i wish id been investing in myself instead of throwing it away on clothes and meaningless things i never had as a child because of my shitty parents. i wish i had one moment of clarity to tell me it's not worth hating myself and i didn't choose to come to this planet. i wish i wish i wish. yeah i accomplished so many things this year but what's the point if my dopamine is fried? i had the ephihany that if i died and i was forced to restart this life over and over again on an endless loop in different bodies, i'll just end my life on all of them even if it took millions of lives to get just one right. maybe some people are quite literally born to take their lives and that’s why i've been thinking about it passively for the past decade. i dont think i can ever go back to smoking because weed isnt even strong enough for the intensity of this.

1pxt38a,Day 21 - I miss my libido so bad,"I'm 23F, smoked daily for 3ish years, at the point I quit I was smoking ~25g a month.

My libido is gone since day 1, like GONE gone. I used to have a high drive but it's absolutely 0 now and I'm having a really hard time with that. This is compounded by the fact that I'm very much in the BDSM community so much of my social life revolves around sexuality.

I'm also in a relationship with an amazing man who's also my dom, we used to have sex twice a week minimum, and we haven't had any for around a month now. I told him my libido is down and he's fully understanding and supportive of my decision to quit weed, he's absolutely not pressuring me to do anything sexual until I feel ready again. But I'm really beating myself up over it.

I use BDSM to cope too, if I have really big feelings I always know a good cry session during BDSM with my partner can help me get it out of my system. But I haven't been able to do that, if I'm not horny BDSM feels like actual violence instead of pretend play, so I can't tap into that coping mechanism at all now.

I used to use weed as an aphrodisiac, I knew what strains made me horny and would roll them up when I wanted to get some. I'm concerned even if my libido comes back it won't be nearly as strong as before. I don't really know myself as an adult without weed, I've been smoking since 19, I don't know what my sober libido is like.

Also started my period today so my emotions are really overwhelming right now. I just miss my libido so bad. My partner will never say it but I know he's disappointed every night I don't initiate. I'm just ughhhhhhhhhhh idk man I want my libido back, it feels like sobriety sent me a freeloader bill (like when you leave scientology) that cost me my libido.

Last October I got a really good deal from my plug, and after buying it I realized I didn't want to buy more after. I started reducing my use a little, but three days ago I decided it was time.

It is like we are not together and I keep looking for her, but she is with someone else. It is like a false history or something, not a current dream. But it is so weird.

I do miss it... I miss the feeling of playing games on my steam deck laying in bed,  wrapped up comfortable and warm.

I have to remind myself that while those were the good times, I also took it too far for too long. Sometimes I hate myself because I know I overdid it for far too long, and I can't have those feelings and experiences anymore.

I dont have anywhere close to the levels of anxiety that I used to have. Even when im dealing with something difficult and stressful at work that is extremely consequential, it seems manageable and normal. This is in sharp contrast to the ever present worry, fear, and 'claw at my throat/chest' feeling that I used to walk around with day in and day out.

The truly tempting moments/cravings aren't too frequent... maybe one every 5 days or so.

But man I sure do miss it sometimes. I haven't thrown my stash away... I host parties at my house occasionally and have friends and neighbors who ask for it. I provide it but I haven't joined them.

Im considering indulging myself on a night when the kids are out of town and its just my wife and I at home... Considering it a 'treat' that maybe ill let myself have only on special occasions.

I’ll have a moment of “it’d be nice to smoke a joint rn” but it’s quickly followed by “yeah, temporarily” and I’m able to move on. Any other time I’ve quit it’s been very difficult, so I’m hoping this time is different. 

I’m starting to process a lot of things at once and feeling quite overwhelmed with all the things I want to do & be with myself and my life. I wasted so much time numbing myself with weed, entered the wrong relationships, let people treat me poorly, missed out on life skills. It just feels like a lot to recover from and idk where to start. I know it’s early on, I’ve quit multiple times so I’ve felt this before. But this time feels different. 

I’m trying to distract myself in anyway I can until I come back to baseline, but it’s a lot waking up to myself and seeing how much I’ve really let myself go. I’m having a major identity crisis - idk what I want out of life. And I’ve been hiding for so long. 

How do you go about rebuilding identity from the ground up? I never had a strong sense of self and have people pleasing tendencies, but I’ve worked on these things in therapy. I believe weed has made it harder to integrate those learnings into my life fully. ",1766902779.0,31,6,leaves,substance

I quit smoking vape distillates about a week and a half ago - like 9-10 days. I quit smoking weed in general maybe...4 days ago?  
I can't stop feeling like my heart is being squeezed constantly, every like 4-5 hours its an overwhelming feeling of pressure in my chest.   
I THINK its just my stomach and nerves but its so worrying all the time when I feel it. Like I can't stop thinking about just that exact thing of my heart failing or something being really wrong with me.  
It comes and goes in waves - I'll be fine when I wake up, or for a few hours in the afternoon, then it hits me again and my chest feels like its being crushed.  
Usually I can tell that the ""pain"" or uncomfortableness is in my stomach, no real pain in my chest or back or arms or jaw or anything.  
It all started around the time, maybe the same day, I quit the distillates.  
I can feel my heart WAY more now, I feel angry a lot and lost other times. Sometimes it feels like I am watching life through a pane of glass, sometimes its an intense brain fog.  
I can't really go to sleep easily, I can stay up for like 20+ hours easily now even though I can FEEL the fatigue hitting my brain (Its like I get swoopy or dizzy feelings in my head).

I stopped a couple of times, but honestly it was usually because I had to, like when I went abroad for work. The moment I got back, I would start again. Not even as a big choice. More like autopilot. At some point I seriously wondered if I would ever be able to quit for real.

Then my relationship ended recently, and something changed. A switch flipped. No big plan. No perfect routine. Just a clear decision in my head. I stopped. And for the first time, I do not feel that pull anymore. I do not want it. I am not “trying to quit.” I am done.

Now I am in, and mostly passed, the phase where the side effects and improvements show up. Sleep was rough at first. Falling asleep was hard, staying asleep was worse. Then the dreams started. Vivid, intense, almost unreal. That part is still here, but it is getting better too.

And for the first time I can say this without feeling like I am lying to myself. I quit.

Here is the part that feels like bad advice, because it sounds too simple. I think it really was willpower all along. Not in a motivational quote way. More like this. The moment the switch flipped, the craving stopped being the boss.

1px0utm,87 days and questioning why - if it's even worth it,"I dunno how to put this really.  I stopped due to guilt , disturbed sleep , and anxiety.  That all subsided after a few weeks off smoking.  But now it seems to be boomeranging back , but not in the acute sudden onset way like before my cessation, but more in a slow constant drip feed.  
I'm off work for the holiday period, and I'm just sitting in my house with nothing to do really. I have taken on a gym/exercise culture since stopping smoking, tbh probably to an extreme that has left me fatigued, I need to have a few rest days, but I am also afraid of just stopping completely . Without the gym I'm flat . 
On a side note the high/contentment  I have been experiencing from exercise is probably abnormal in some way , I go from feeling low to thinking everything is golden , and then that subsides to being low again .

Without exercising I  just wonder what is the point in not smoking , sure my mind is clear , clear to just feel like pretty much a loser. I have considerably less friends these days than years gone by, every year I seem to lose friendships. But tbh I have no motivation to try and form new connections,I just mourn the ones that are now gone.  

Have been thinking of how pleasurable it might be to just get some bud, wrap up and go to the forest and smoke a fat one.  Then I think about being absolutely whacked and having to trek back home again . 
This has been my thought loop now for pretty much two days straight. 

Not sure what I'm expecting out of writing this .

1pwxmts,Having a hard time,"Hello everybody,

In the beginning of April 2025 i've quit smoking cigarettes and weed cold turkey. The first week was the hardest, couldn't sleep and kept looking at the ceiling. But eventually I found it very easy to quit smoking. The problem is I've exchanged my smoking habit with an eating one. Back when I smoked my weight was always around 132 lbs (60kg), I could eat fastfood every day and I didn't gain weight. Fast forward to today, +-8 months later. My weight is now 209 lbs (95kg). My face has become an acné warzone. Even in my puberty years I've never ever had this much acne. Now i'm at the point that I don't dare going out with friends to x-mas and new year parties. On one side i'm happy I've quit smoking, on the other side I deeply regret it. If I had known I'd gain this much weight, acne and a decreasing confidence. I'd never have stopped smoking... But now I can't go back, because obviously if I'd smoke a joint right now i'm not going to magically lose 30 pounds. Anyone else had experiences like this? Any advice would be deeply appreciated.  

By the way: My height is 5'11"" or 180cm. 29 years old male",1766841473.0,8,9,leaves,substance

I’m tired, my eating is off, and I feel like I need a short break but part of my brain tells me I’m just being lazy. The problem is, I’ve learned that when I ignore these signs and push anyway, I end up breaking down, and that’s when I’m most at risk of relapsing.

Am on meds for the anxiety, but it's making me lethargic. Can't go without right now because of the anxiety and panick attacks will make me freak out.

Moved to a different country and fairly isolated now too, and full of doubt if this was the right decision.

1pwt5p6,Reflection and rebuilding 'brain power',"Hey everyone. I am proud to say that I have now achieved 21 full days sober (going on that saying that 21 days makes/breaks a habit), and I'd like to offer brief reflection, and then ask for some advice as per the title.I feel cleaner, more in control of my thoughts and emotions, the cravings have not been too bad and I can't necessarily say I have a strong desire to go back. I smoked for 5 years (age 19-24), very heavily (multiple sessions a day) for the latter 2 and a half or so. In this time, these past 21 days is the longest period I've gone without it, closest second being around 2 weeks.

The 'brain fog' has seemed to mostly been cleared up now, but I still feel sluggish. Some context is maybe useful here: I've always performed well academically and the kind of person that has a lot on their ate (I'm currently an MA candidate and hold a full-time job), but of course in the height of addiction, I gradually lost my functionality, weed became counterproductive, stress and anxiety levels have consistentlently been through the roof, etc.Thinking, reading, writing, holding memory, became a heck of a task.

Now as I sober up on vacation, I've returned to reading, one of my favourite hobbies (I'm ashamed to say that my weed problem got in the way especially of this), watching longer form documentaries and videos, actually paying keen attention in movies and series, and I'm noticing I'm not quite processing things as well as I used to pre-weed, and I feel really cognitively stunted.

Does anyone who has been sober a while have some practical advice on how I can gradually improve cognition? Things like information processing, memory, reading speed, writing ability, and wow, even speaking! (Sometimes, it's like pure gibberish comes out of my mouth, and there are times I somewhat battle to articulate myself as though I'm mildly high)?

There are I guess the 'standards' - like plain old practice, reading more, doing puzzles , mental math and the like, but I'm open in a holistic sense, all the way from daily habits to exercise, nutrition, task types, etc.

1pwo6th,Seeing a substance abuse counselor changed everything: some takeaways,"Backstory: I (M32) am 18-ish months free from weed and tobacco, after smoking constantly for 5-6 years and smoking regularly for around 4 years before then. So, a good 10 years of smoking heavily.
So much life happened while I was smoking a lot. I wanted to quit but just felt stuck to the habit. I was in a cycle of feeling ashamed of myself because of my habit, and smoking to relieve that uncomfortable feeling. It was really hard for a really long time. 
Eventually, I got a new pcp and was able to see a therapist through the practice. I mentioned that a goal of mine was working on weed and tobacco usage, and once I was set up with a therapist, he turned out to be a substance abuse counselor with decades of experience. Here are some takeaways from John that helped me quit smoking and stay off it:

1) Any substance that creates a pleasurable sensation can be addictive. There are differences between individual substances of course, in terms of how physically addictive or destructive they tend to be, but by downplaying my experience as just a bad habit rather than an addiction, I was keeping myself locked in that cycle. 

2) Weed, specifically, is an addictive drug.

3) Addiction will knock down the boundaries you try to put up around it to limit its negative effects. Every single line I drew around my weed usage, I eventually crossed. By the end, there were no boundaries at all. This is one reason that “cutting down” never really worked. These were intermediate efforts, and the addiction ground those boundaries down every time.

4) An addictive behavior is often, paradoxically, a ploy to show yourself you’re in control. This one is tough to explain but made sense when I heard it. Government and society falling apart? Starting a stressful new job? Global pandemic? Got just the thing for all of that. Furthermore, my smoking habits reflected what made me the most anxious - socializing, work, driving, seeing family. Weed doesn’t make any cognitive activity easier, but throwing that wrench in the gears can make you feel more in control, weirdly.

5) There is no replacement for a given substance. How could there be? It is a distinct compound that affects the brain and body in a unique way. One narrative that kept me locked in my addiction was “once I find a good replacement, I will quit”. There never was, is, or will be a replacement for weed. I just had to move on. Which leads to:

6) It’s okay to miss it. When I was smoking, I had this image of sober-me as like this unflappable monk on a mountaintop, who had overcome something really hard and now lived in a permanent state of Zen, incapable of temptation. And because I didn’t feel ready to be that character, I didn’t feel ready to quit. Of course, I’m still not that guy. And that’s scarier in a way, because Zen monk guy clearly has the strength to stay sober, and me who’s been smoking before work and driving stoned doesn’t seem like a particularly strong person. Which leads to:

7) Start where you are. A lot of the classic lines from AA and NA, like “take it one day at a time,” are so ubiquitous and cliche because they’re true, at least for many people. Just try not to smoke. And keep trying. And don’t give up. It’s so much more complex, and at the same time, exactly that simple.

i find myself fantasising about a day where i’ll

be able to finally do it again. it’s hard for me to imagine myself being somebody who actually doesn’t want to do it, or doesn’t feel the need to. i don’t even know if i should give up that thought and accept the addiction as a part of myself.

the way i became addicted actually pisses me off: i used to smoke occasionally for like two years and i had absolutely no problem quitting for long periods of time, it actually bothered me to smoke too much and i found it absurd how some people could not go more than a few days without it, let alone a few hours. 

i became addicted by smoking with my friends and rarely ever bought it myself or smoked alone. and yet, without noticing, i slowly started craving it every day and it became a core part of my life. it took me almost a year to finally decide i wanted to quit for good. i hit 4 months a few days ago and the longest i’d gone before this time was two weeks! 

i’m proud of myself and i’m slowly getting stronger and better at handling the cravings. the other day i spent the whole evening around people who probably rolled at least 4-5 in the span of a few hours and i actually managed to have a good time while being around them and not giving in. not that they would’ve offered me some anyways, cuz unfortunately they’re very deep in it themselves and are VERY greedy with it lol. 

but yeah, regardless of the cravings getting easier to handle i just find it so frustrating how every single time i have plans where i know there’s gonna be weed i spend several hours internally fighting with myself, often ruining the excitement or any other positive feeling towards the hang out.

My girlfriend discovered my pot and alcohol abuse two years ago, literally at Christmas. After that betrayal of trust, it’s been a long two years of trying to fix us… and though I’ve been in therapy (both individual and couples) and got a handle on many things (including the alcohol), I’ve been secretly on and off the wagon with pot several times. The longest stretch I’ve been sober is about six months in that time. 

I honestly can’t explain why I can’t quit. I know that it’s ruining my life, and there’s an extremely good chance that now that my girlfriend has caught me again, there are no second (third, fourth, millionth) chances and I’ve likely lost the love of my life. And I knew that if I kept lying to her and got caught again, her capacity to forgive would be pretty minimal. And yet… here I am. Again. 

I know I can’t change my past actions and if she walks away, I’ll just have to live with the consequences of my actions and lies.

1pw862y,Edibles for Christmas,"My buddy got me a 100mg pack of gummy edibles as a little Christmas present. Since it was a “special occasion” (classic blunder) I allowed myself to have some, and I had an unremarkable time zoning out in front of the computer for several hours. Then I flushed the rest of the edibles down the toilet.

That was last night — now I’m at work feeling tired and hungover from the gummies. I don’t feel smart or sharp, just lazy and boring. I hate it. But later today, as that feeling fades I know I’m going to want to go and buy more gummies. 

I need to remember that I didn’t even have a great time when I took them. I’ll have a much better time going home, putting some music on, and just making dinner normally instead of getting high so I can disassociate and neglect the habits that make me healthy. 

And I’ll feel so good tomorrow if I don’t get high tonight. I’ll feel like myself. I’ll be able to look at people without wondering if they can see how heavy my eyelids feel, or if they can tell how slowly my brain is operating. 

I won’t fall back into the cycle of feeling awful and then compensating by getting high. I don’t want to procrastinate on being healthy again. I’m a happier person when I’m not getting high, and there’s so arguing against that. 

Love you all. Hope you’re having some happy holidays.",1766766161.0,30,4,leaves,substance
1pw7v0u,"18 Days In, How do Yall Stay Motivated? 💗","Hi all! Long time lurker on this sub. I’m currently 18 days sober and have been trying very hard to not fall back into the habit of smoking. I’ve gotten 2-3 weeks into quitting a few times this year, but fell back on the habit each time previously. I’ve been smoking since \~17, daily since 22 (my mom unexpectedly passed away, quite traumatically, and I took on a TON of responsibility out of nowhere, so weed was 100% my escape). I’m now 26(F).

This year, a cropping of side effects from smoking over the last few years has really started to weigh on me- I’ve gained a lot of weight from binging with the munchies, my periods have become much more irregular, my doctor found that I have very high levels of inflammation in my body (we’ve ruled out that it isn’t a chronic illness of any sort at this point), it exacerbates my asthma and makes it so hard to breathe, and my anxiety/depressive symptoms now spike when I smoke regularly, where it felt like smoking used to help with regulation. In addition, I’ve taken on more responsibility with my job, and I want to be clearer minded.

You’d think all of this would be reason enough to quit, but I feel like I just can’t learn my lesson.. I’m on the neurodivergent spectrum, and have PMDD and depression. It’s been hell trying to break this addiction given the quick relief that a puff’s always brought me. 

*So, how do y’all stay motivated to quit?* Most of the time, I’m SO much happier now that I’ve stopped using, but the cravings are INTENSE when they hit, and it’s so hard to give a fuck about my motivations and reasoning in those moments- my brain is just like “IDC, GIMME!”

1pw5uzh,Day 21 struggles and temptations with family,"I've been lurking for a while, but I will say a gracious thank you to everyone who contributes and supports in this community. The resources and stories here have been beyond helpful during my struggles.

  
I figure I'll start with some of my history - I only smoked a few times before my state legalized recreationally. Until a year ago, I was smoking every day for over 4 years getting into a pretty depressed state, thinking that weed was the only thing keeping me alive. Eventually with some therapy and determination, I was able to push past the worst of the symptoms and stayed sober for over 3 months. Thanksgiving 2024, I went home for the holidays and my family has bonded over smoking and watching movies/shows together. Like many others, I thought ""only once"" since I had been able to hold off, but that turned into every night, time and time again.

This year, I've quit several times for shorter periods, noticing when I feel those dark/paranoid feelings creeping in again, and as of today we're on attempt #3 to stay sober. I felt very confident these past few weeks, but coming home again the temptation has been creeping up on me. So far I've been able to push through these feelings, knowing what it will eventually lead to. It's been difficult this year though, I feel a barrier between us and our usual traditions. Part of me has been wanting to go pick up a pack of nicotine vape (no THC) - just to have something, but that was difficult enough too quitting years ago. Replacement can't be my answer.

I don't really have a lot of people to share these feelings with, so thank you for reading through this. There's a quote I read on here that has stuck with me, and hopefully will help someone else too. ""It's easier to stay sober than to get sober.""",1766760170.0,2,3,leaves,substance

Through this experience I’ve felt soooo emotionally exhausted. I’ve had to fight for myself everyday in a way I’ve never had to before. I wake up in the morning I fight I go to bed I fight.

33F heavy smoker for 12 years. It is the first time in my life that I genuinely want to quit. I managed to stay off for a week but the thing is one close friend of mine is selling it. I dont know what to do and how to explain to him how hard it is for me to see him and hang out since he always has weed on him and he smokes 24/7. 

Also I dont feel 100% sure that he genuinely wants me to quit nor that he is happy for me. Whenever I suffer from withdrawals he might say something like “maybe you can just have one to feel better or sleep” or he might just roll one for himself or come to my place with a rolled joint. Also when we talk about it he says things like “but from what I understand you dont want to quit weed forever, you just need to regulate”. And that is NOT the case. 

Sometimes it is okay and he just smokes right next to me and I feel no urge to smoke. Other times I feel very tempted though and I just have a puff. Yesterday I was feeling like shit so I asked him to roll one, I had 3 puffs and felt awful, terrible anxiety and weird heartbeat, like my body is rejecting it. He smoked the rest and then he rolled another. 

I know it is not his fault, I know I am the weak one and I know that recovery is a personal journey but it is extremely hard for me to hang out with him.

1pvqdr7,day 8 after the ER,"I’ve been on this thread a few days and realized I need to make an accountability post. Today is 8 days since abstaining completely. 

Last week, I was hospitalized twice for cyclical vomiting. The worst pain I have ever experienced in my life. I am still dehydrated. This happened to me once before in 2017 but I have been ignoring their CHS diagnosis because they also missed a bacterial and infection my gut for months that was making everything way worse. I also wasn’t ready to accept. 

Part of me had a feeling it was CHS but I was also still in denial, not wanting to give up the plant. I wasn’t fully honest with the doctors so they couldn’t give me a proper diagnosis, but they mentioned CHS. If I was honest about my use and the treatment for symptoms they would have diagnosed me. I also developed GERD, and am now realizing this is probably also because of chronic smoking and the irritation. 


I’ve known for months, if not years, that this plant doesn’t sit well with me. I’ve known for a long time that I’m addicted but have been in denial. 

8 years ago I was in abusive relationships and workplaces and was using the weed to cope. It kept me in those places way longer than I should have been. I became reliant on the pattern of using weed to check out emotionally, mentally, physically. I have made progress in life but also it’s devastating to look back at the impacts this plant has had on my health and my relationships. Many feelings of course coming to the surface, all around grief. 

I’m scared a bit but more than anything confident and ready to let go of this chapter, I want to be healthy and I want to be in control of my life again. I hope some can relate.

have been smoking, vaping, eating edibles, and generally consuming any available form of weed for 5 years (since lockdown days). started in 2020 in college, mostly used flower at parties to make the little voice in my head that says “you’re cringe” whenever i speak, shut up. worked effectively. too effectively. i got so used to the feeling of being high and how it could mask certain emotions and sensations that weed became a daily habit for me. it made my ADHD-having ass feel normal for once in my life. finding wax pens was the beginning of the downward spiral as i became a cart a week smoker.

fast forward 4 years and it’s had a big impact. won’t divulge too much of my personal business here, but my health is not in good shape. i developed CHS about 3 years in like so many heavy users do, and instead of taking the initiative to quit, i kept smoking (because i would only get sick when i stopped.) CHS is a really tricky one to beat or even realize for this reason. weed was still helping me feel “normal” and regulated, so i ignored everything. you should never get to this point! 

not exactly sure what ultimately has made me quit other than just knowing i can’t do this anymore. i can’t continue to sacrifice several aspects of my mental and physical health for a plant that barely even works for me anymore. the only feeling being high gave me anymore was just relief from not having to be sober, which sucks. been sober now 6 days, and i can already see that weed in such heavy quantities for so long was dulling out everything in my brain.

1pvbo7x,"Rollercoasters, sickness and cannabis","Hey.  
M36, used extremely heavy for over 23 years.   
Clean for 1 month and 2 weeks.

It's been hell. Just straight up hell.  
Massive anxiety, huge anger, racing thoughts; extreme boredom, chronic short of sleep and just straight up uncomfortable, very manic brain. I know this is part of the process and i have to hold on, but i do not wish this upon anyone.   
Weed is a very very devious drug and you'll downplay and romanticize it until you hate yourself and are truly ready to quit. Had many attempts in my long stoner carreer.

First month is just truly awful. Second month, the physical stuff is getting better, but the emotional side of withdrawel hits you like a truck and it's stays a long time. I've been to 8 months before and relapsed due depression and no support.  
I go to therapy now and have a sober girlfriend that is really supportive.  
Hope this time, i will finally make it trough that first year. After that, i understand the most of the weed induced patterns are gone and it's up to the gym and healthy food and social interactions to feel good. Stay strong fellow quitters, you really want to be clean and finish this.

Anyway, my question was actually this one:  
I am a huge rollercoaster enthusiast, but 1 ride makes me sweaty, dizzy, and gets me sick for the whole day. I don't puke or anything like that, but the headache and general discomfort kills the day for me. I can't ride them anymore.

Now, my whole life i have been riding rollercoasters .. on weed.. high.. stoned.. dehydrated.  
Could it maybe have such a huge effect on my body that i might be able to withstand the forces better when i'm fully detoxed and weed free? It would be such a huge motivation for me to keep going, because i fucking love that airtime.   
Has anyone experience with this? Can you handle rollercoasters better when you're clean?  
I surely do hope so.

Thank you for listening to me and i wish every person in here luck in his or her story.  
If you're feeling down and depressed, it's part of the detox proces, and if you used very heavy, from a very young age, it takes a lot longer than someone who indulged way less.

I’ve read some old reddit posts, but wondering if anyone from less than a year ago has some advice.

I am free since a week. One of the reasons that prompted me to leave it behind was this: I had taken a shower, put on some sports pants and smoked one or two on my balcony. As always I changed my clothes but I put this fresh pants into my gym bag and went there.

When I arrived in the gym, the smell of the adidas pants that I was wearing was shoking. It was reeking of smoke. I felt so uncomfortable. I think people smelled it aswell. Horrible experience. 

It was a moment where I truly realized that this sh\*t is not normal. 

Horrible cough for 3 days. But much better afterwards. What helped was a lot of menthol sweets, gums. 

Also, buying aroma sticks and putting it in your home. Just the nice smell, it is a reminder that I prefer this smell over the toxic smell.

Also went on an hour long walks each day. No gym as of yet. Step by step, we will improve our cardio.

I think I will go to the gym soon but take it slowly. I want to focus more on walking in the first month. 

Also, I did inversion therapy, basically hanging from my pull up bar 2 to 3 times for a minute or two each day to help the blood flow to the face. I had very bad under eyes/eye bags. 

But now I can see an improvement to skin. It might take some more weeks but I am enjoying some benefits already like not having to drive to buy that stuff, and also it was more costly than I realized.

I do some work, then I rush for a smoke. I eat and I rush for a smoke. I go to a gathering, grab a drink - pull out the cigarettes. I spend more than I’d wish conversating - I light a smoke.

I started vaping in 2020 because of my roommate’s and honestly that was pretty easy to quit after I stopped in 2022. 

But back in 2024 I picked up nicotine gum and it has rocked my world, I’ve never felt addicted to something until this. I’ve literally woken up from sleep because of cravings, though that was when I was doing 4mg. I’ve been doing 2mg ever since last summer.

Ive taken breaks from it but always find myself coming back to it and now it’s more difficult than ever.

1q97sla,6 days in after 35 years,"And it sucks a lot more than I expected it to.

I stupidly started smoking when I was 12. The adults in my life just seemed to not be bothered by it because they all did it, and it was the early 90s, so I just continued doing it. I tried to quit a number of times through the years, but only really got off the death sticks after I had 4 heart attacks 26 years later. Family history aside, it was the only real other cause of them. My cardiologist said if I didn't quit, it would kill me. I believed him that time, and quit.                  

I didn't do it cold turkey, obviously, because after such a long habit, and during recovery after my heart attacks, I didn't want to put my body under unnecessary strain. Luckily for me, I'd started vaping as well about a year before, so transitioning from cigarettes to e-cigs was a breeze, as I'd been dual using for ages already (I was down to around 5 cigs a days, alternating with the vape when I quit). Felt no withdrawal symptoms that I could remember, and it all felt great! I'd broken my 26-year smoking habit! Go me! I've been ***smoke*** ***free*** since 1 September 2018. 

6 years later, and I was still vaping, though... My smoking cessation tool had done its job perfectly, but I had swapped one addiction for another. I'd tried to quit a few times, but nothing ever stuck for longer than a couple of days (the average was about 18hrs). I suppose it didn't help that because of the nature of vaping, I ended up vaping *way* more than I'd *ever* smoked. Queue a once in a lifetime trip to Australia. They have/had weird laws regarding vaping, and didn't want to take any chances, so I abruptly quit cold turkey a month before we were due to fly over. And it was 3 days of turmoil. I'd binned all my vaping gear, but knew I couldn't fish it out (again). My wife reminded me that I'd previously bought NRT spray years ago. I didn't want to have to use it, because it never really worked and gave me hiccups, and because I'd again just be replacing one addiction for another, but I just couldn't take it anymore so I went to the store and bought some. It didn't work straight away, but eventually the withdrawal subsided. The trick to using it, it turns out, was to NOT use it like a mouth spray, but to spray it directly under your tongue. Go figure. I've been ***vape*** ***free*** since 1 December 2024. 

And, of course, I became *addicted* to it! So, just over a year of using NRT to quit vaping and several attempts to quit it later, I made it my New Year's resolution to *finally* put the bitch to bed. Clock struck midnight, I binned the spray - and caved 18hrs later... But, I was determined to be free of my 35-year addiction, so I got back on that horse! And failed again. ""I'll give up trying until Sunday"" I told myself. Kept using until midnight on Sunday - I'd already preemptively booked this whole week off. The clock struck midnight again, used the spray one last time, tossed it in the bin... and haven't used any nicotine since. I have been ***nicotine*** free since 5 January 2026. 

Not going to lie, the first three days were a living hell. I was going off my head most of it. My ***organs*** hurt and sometimes felt like they were spasming! I've had insomnia, constipation, aching joints, concentration issues, headaches, the feeling like my brain is wrapped in cling-wrap that's slowly being tightened, etc. The absolute worst was day 3 physically. But, the *mental* aspect has been far worse in the days that followed. I'm on day 6 now, with every day after day 3 being the longest I've ever gone without nicotine. I woke up this morning, expecting progress, and I'll wanted to do was get that spray out of the kitchen drawer, spray under my tongue, and feel the relief. Except, there is no spray in the kitchen drawer - or anywhere else in the flat - and I don't do that anymore. But, there's this constant drumming in my head - because I *have* to have it. I *need* it. Just *one* more spray. That's all it would take to make me feel *so* much better. *Just* one spray, and I'd be right on track again with my quit. Just. One. Spray. But, it's already after 3PM, so I'll leave it for today. If I still feel this way tomorrow, I'll pop into the Superdrug down the road, and get some spray - for just that *one* spray that will make *everything* better. It's just too late to go now, so I'll just wait until then. 

That's how I've survived the last 6 days, because I honestly have had no idea what else to do. My constant well of dopamine has dried up now, too, so I have this constant feeling like something is missing from my life. As someone on the spectrum, it's additionally difficult because I require that constant stream of chemical stimulation that simply isn't there anymore. It's kept me going and on track for ***most of life***, and now it's just ***gone***. And I don't know how to deal with that, or how long it takes to start feeling ""normal"", or if I ever will? Send help!

The thing is, I listened to my body.

I didn't go out of home unless it's very necessary and I didn't even realized how fast 1 year passed. It's been an year since I smoked and I feel healthier than ever now.

I just anyhow convince myself to wait till the night to smoke and then slept early and said I'll smoke in morning, I continued it and so fast it's already an year and I don't feel urges anymore.

Have I kept smoking, I would've smoke 500+ cigarette in an year and worsen my health very much.

I used to imagine leaving smoking and after 1 year I'll be so healthy, I actually did exactly that and I feel so much better than I expected.

The main thing is don't say to yourself that you're leaving smoking forever, say you'll smoke at evening. Then when evening comes, get busy and at night say to yourself you'll smoke first thing in morning.

Keep delaying and delaying and it becomes habit to resist it. Don't try to win it forever, just win the day and keep repeating.

1q8zqy9,Day 1 - Writing all this for myself actually !,"Okay so I have been smoking for 4 years now, and I've just decide to quit for good. I have many reasons to not do it actually. So mentioning some here 

1. I am 27 and I was always able to say no to anybody who offered me anything to smoke, be it in college parties or casual meet ups. I never drank in college either. Until 2022 and everything changed. I couldn't say no anymore and I think that has impacted my personality, I've started people pleasing because of it. So I just want to go back to being a prude lol. I used to love that version of me. 

2. I LOVEEEE good skin, I am a skincare fanatic and any kind of pigmentation/dark spots make me feel weird and I wanna correct them asap. It didn't happen till now but I think after 4 years of smoking the dullness on my face, undereyes, lips are showing evidently so it is giving me constant anxiety. 

3. I use a cigg just to escape my emotions for the day. Whatever bad i am feeling i just postpone it till the time I can have a smoke and that it how i dont process them at all. I just use the cigg to not think about my underlying emotions. And now i dont want to do that.

4. My family has got to know about it and it is extremely shameful for me to think. I cant let that be the case. I want them to start rebuilding their trust on me fr. 

5. I am working very hard for a good future for my family and me and hence would want to live it to the fullest, not with a scare of diseases and deteriorating health after 40. I want to see good days with my kids and my family. 

6. Its been a long time since I've done something challenging and won in it. So I've started feeling I can't do things anymore but in reality I am quite a freak when it comes to getting things done. So I wanna do this just to tell myself I still got it. 

7. Also, someone I love with all my heart wants me to quit. So I will.

I am 35 years old. I have been smoking since I was 12 (!) years old, I got into it so young because of my father's death. For the first 2 years I smoked 2-5 cigarettes a week, then I became completely addicted to the habit by the age of 15, from then on I smoke 1 pack/day. I have spent the most of my life with smoking and I feel it drives me completely. I arrange my life around this nasty monster.

The time has come, I have had enough. Regular smoking was replaced by smoking with heated tobacco/tea based products in 2021. We can say that since then I do not constantly smell of tobacco, my body tolerates it better, but let's not forget that there is still too little research available on this. Nicotine is also part of it.

I tried to quit once in my life (many years ago) with Allen Carr's book, but I failed by the end of the third day. For the first time since then I feel the determination again. I've been playing with fire so far, it's a wonder there hasn't been a more serious problem, but it's become so much a part of my everyday life that it's starting to get boring, I've started to worry about the consequences, and it's not to be underestimated how much money I'm spending on it. I would like to be totally free again, I’ve already forgotten what it feels like.

I'm going to do it with a cytisine cure this time, I trust it and myself that this time I'll manage to get rid of this shackle. This is the 6th day of the cure which means that this is the 1st day of my journey! I can do this, and you can do this too :)

I'm 22 and have been smoking since I was 16, and it had gone up to a pack a day for the last year, which as a college student I a) couldn't afford, and b) started really taking up a lot of my time. I also started getting the smoker cough which kinda freaked me out.

I'm a week clean, but I also started a new internship this week, which has been pretty stressful, and also I returned to the gym last month, so I've been having long and stressful days and every time I come home from work and gym, the lawyer in my brain starts arguing about how I can cut down to a couple a day instead of a pack, and taper off instead of going cold turkey.

This weekend especially with no work, he's been quite loud, saying I can reward myself with just a couple for this weekend as the work has been too stressful and I need to relax. I've already been to the gym twice today. I don't know what else to do to shut the lawyer out. I'm an impulsive person, and im worried I will make a snap decision giving into the lawyer's arguments which sound so reasonable.

1q87cbp,Tips to Quit Smoking,"PRIOR TO QUITTING

Quit for yourself.

You may have family and loved ones who are urging you to quit using nicotine. This may be helpful, but can sometimes leave a nicotine user annoyed and defensive. Even though your family and loved ones will benefit tremendously from your quitting, it is you who will benefit most. There is a better chance of quitting and staying stopped when we quit for ourselves. Getting support from other quitters helps to raise your hopes and to strengthen your desire to quit. 

YOUR FIRST DAYS OF FREEDOM

Sometimes all we need is a distraction to shift our focus from a craving. 

In the beginning it is better to keep yourself busy than to allow yourself the time to obsess about what you are not doing. It is important to keep putting more time between you and your last dose of nicotine. 

REMAINING FREE

All you have to do is not have the ""next one"" and you will avoid smoking thousands. 

Don't fool yourself and think you can start and stop at will. You can't (or else you would have years ago). Trying to control an addictive substance is engaging in an endless battle.

1q85hgh,Terrible physical symptoms 6 weeks after quitting. Anyone else?,"Hi, it's been six weeks since I quit nicotine using nicotine pouches. I was a heavy user in the sense that I used 10+ strong pouches a day for six years straight. 

The problem is that after six weeks, I have no urge to put nicotine under my lip, and I've made up my mind that I won't do it. But physically, I feel like total crap. I have high blood pressure when i measure it from time to time, I don't sleep well, my vision is most days kinda blurry, I constantly have a strange feeling behind my eyes, and on top of that, I feel nauseous and dizzy. Plus, I'm often tired. The funny thing is that many of these are actually withdrawal symptoms.

On top of that, I have muscle spasms (fasciculations), which were also present throughout my body six months ago, and quitting nicotine did not help. I checked it with doctor and he said its normal, even though it has been long ongoing.

Everywhere I read about how everyone felt better after a few days, a week at most, and then only had to fight the urge for nicotine. I've been clean for 6 weeks and physically I'm totally screwed, yet i dont have any cravings.

Does anyone have similar experiences, either with nicotine pouches and quitting, or with withdrawal symptoms that last so long in general? Because I'm starting to think that it may not be from that and that when I was taking nicotine, I just didn't notice these things and its something else.

1q7wjls,Some reflections,"Hi! 

I am now 9 days smoke-free after finishing Allen Carr's book for the second time. I won't deny that some days have been really hard in terms of mood and productivity. 

I was already familiar with Allen Carr and, although I consider his book useful overall, I am not the greatest fan of the writing style or some of his arguments. For example, when he insists that people only “think” they like smoking, I cannot help but think of many things in life that are an ""acquired taste"", just like smoking, but are not necessarily unhealthy. Another thing I feel is missing from the book is how much smoking can be perceived by the smoker as part of their very identity , and how sanctimonious non-smokers make it even harder to quit. 

In any case, this time Carr was useful for me to think again about some of the things he says, and most importantly to have a tool that could help me look at my quit day with anticipation (""once I finish this, I won't smoke anymore""). 

Here are two things that I believe are helping me now, but I would love to hear the opionion of more ""experienced"" non-smokers:

1) Maybe, I don't have to convinve myself that cigarettes are disgusting and uncool at all costs, as Carr seems to suggests. There are SOME occasions (not all of them) when smoking is in fact quite cool or enjoyable. However, I am aware that I decided to quit for my HEALTH and my FREEDOM and my MONEY and my LOVED ONES. Maybe this is what Carr calls the ""willpower"" method, but I also perceive it as something that aligns more closely to my experience.

2) Related to this, quitting smoking doesn't mean I have to become one of the moralistic ""non-smokers""  who made me feel so incredibly judged. I can just be a person who doesn't smoke.",1767927176.0,6,12,stopsmoking,substance

1q7m3s6,Depression sort of?,"Hi everyone,
Today is my seventh day smoke-free. I quit using Asmoken/Tabex (for those who don’t know it: it’s a “plant-based” alternative to varenicline).
Quitting itself was much easier than I expected. I was especially worried about habits like drinking coffee without a cigarette, but that actually hasn’t been a problem at all.
What has been difficult is my mood. It feels like a kind of flatline. I wouldn’t say I’m depressed, but my emotional state feels very constant — not good, not bad, always with a slight sense of melancholy. What stands out to me most is that those moments where you genuinely look forward to something seem to be gone. Everything feels a bit numb. That honestly worries me, because I’m afraid of developing a more serious issue.
I don’t really know many ex-smokers I can talk to about this, so I’d really appreciate hearing about other people’s experiences and how long this phase lasted for them.
The reason I quit smoking is simple: I no longer want to be a smoker. I enjoyed smoking, I could afford it, and I didn’t have any health problems forcing me to quit. After 14 years, I stopped entirely by choice. For me, the benefits clearly outweigh the downsides. Cutting down or switching to vaping wasn’t an option — I know myself well enough to know I’d eventually end up back at the same number of cigarettes.

When I actually quit I felt ready to break down and smoke pretty often. Any time I was seriously craving a cigarette I'd tell myself ""Maybe I'll have one in an hour."" That wasn't an overwhelming amount of time to wait. When I got through the hour I could repeat that if I had to. Those smoke free hours added up to a day, and then more days. I was able to get through the initial withdrawal in the first days.

1. Loosing interest in life (i thought it was the b up but no i survived much worse, the nicotine multiplied it)
2. Faced symptoms of ahnedonia, derealization, depersonalization (google them)
3. Stopped working on my health in any way, felt like I was no longer a human.
4. Bad libido, always felt like fighting demons in my head.
5. Never had a peaceful moment. Almost had an identity crisis, i couldn't recognise myself anymore.
I had it, i started to do research and understood these things were happening due to constantly damaging myself with nicotine. As hard as it was I accepted that i am a nicotine addict. Once I understood this and stopped sugarcoating it I was finally able to understand the devil for what it is. Reading Allen Carr's book of ""The easy way to stop smoking"" has also helped me a lot. He teaches you everything about how it makes us slaves and keeps us hooked for the rest of our lives and how much normalised it is. I had quit mentally before i did physically from then on, i started to hate every puff i took in, sometimes almost felt like puking but I held it in and fixed a date to stop this filth, it was from January 2 this year and I did it. It's been a week since then and these r the advantages of quitting it for good:
1. After 3-4 days I felt peaceful after years, which is a very big thing.
2. The fatigue rn is long gone, i feel much more energetic.
3. Life is feeling livable again, my dopamine is getting stabilized again.

Smoking has been the one vice I didn't think I'd ever overcome.  However, in December I traveled to Mexico for a friends wedding. When I was there I bought a carton of Marlboros and smoked the whole damn thing during my excursion down there. When I returned home I got this death flu that's been running rampant everywhere. I thought maybe i couldnt breath because I was basically smoking non stop the entire trip (roughly 2 packs a day) But after a 2 day fit of not being able to smoke because of a lung infection I decided to keep the ball rolling. In the past ive been sick and not smoked for up to 7 days but I always relapsed when something pissed me off and needed my old faithful vice. 

Not this time though. I'm on day 23 cold turkey. My clothes don't stink anymore. My breathing is better.  Food tastes and smells better. And I no longer have to worry about burning holes in all my favorite clothes or my bedsheets. 

I'm a stubborn man and it's always been a problem, but this time I'm being stubborn and putting it towards something good. So stubborn in fact that I've had an open pack of smokes sitting on my night stand with a lighter next to it staring at me this whole time. But I've refused to give in.. 

I've even had a couple nights of drinking with my friends who all smoke and I refused to cave. 

I also will never preach that ""you should stop that dirty habit"" shit, because it's know what it's like. Smoking was my very best friend. 

But if I can do it, YOU can do it. 

You got this.

am already at the stage where am coughing out brown tar, sometimes a bit clearer, bit nobody ever tells You about this.
i think if we warn future would-be smoker about coughing up brown tar, most would change their minds - i know i would.
So how bad are withdrawals if i go cold turkey? Will i be sick, pale and shaking? i want to prepare and distract myself out of it somehow.

Its just the worst thing.

Always having something fidgeting between Your fingers.

But im not sure if chips exist for nicotine in the way they do for sobriety (AA and NA)

I also happen to be one year sober on the same day. Quit for a while to make sure I didn’t make a drunk mistake and start smoking again. Did dry January, which turned into dry February, which turned into six months and then decided to complete a year to exercise self discipline and continue to ensure I didn’t drunkenly fuck up my no nic streak. 

But my goal was never, and is still not, to give up drinking forever. In fact I have a planned date for a fun event with friends next month where I’m going to drink again for the first time.

So 9 years of smoking. Wow what the hell im just realizing how much of time this is depending on when i started.

Anyways im smoke free 4 days now.

Ive had a try two years ago but it only lasted a month and i fell back. This wont happen this time.

I got some Nic gums (i am more a fan of cold turkey but they helping me slowly killing the addiction and reducing it)

1 day ago i got sick dont know where its coming from maybe a virus or something i dont know, just having headaches, little bit dizzy and my stomach hurts. diarrhea also.

So the sickness and the psych withdrawal is not so nice.

Im very happy for any tips on how to challenge this

1q5n9sy,3 days smoke-free after years of daily smoking,"I’m 27M. I started smoking in mid-2023 with just 1–2 cigarettes a day. At the time it felt harmless. Over 2024 it slowly crept up, and by 2025 I was smoking 6–8 cigarettes daily, with some days going as high as 10.

The worst part wasn’t even the smoking itself — it was the **shortness of breath**, the constant **anxiety if I didn’t smoke**, and how often I smoked purely out of **boredom**. I never liked the smell, never liked the aftertaste, but that *chemical hit from the first puff* always pulled me back.

In December 2025, I finally said “enough.” I decided I’d reduce first and then quit completely. I managed to bring it down to 4 cigarettes a day. Then New Year’s Eve hit — I smoked 11 cigarettes. The next day I felt terrible and smoked again. That guilt spiral was real.

On **3rd Jan 2026**, I decided to stop completely. No tapering, no excuses.

About 3 days later, the withdrawal symptoms hit hard — restlessness, anxiety, that uncomfortable “something’s missing” feeling. I gave in and bought **nicotine gum**, honestly expecting it to be useless. Surprisingly, it worked. I felt calmer, more in control, and didn’t feel the urge to light up.

Right now, I’m **3 days smoke-free**. I’m using nicotine gum sparingly and consciously because I don’t want to replace one addiction with another. My goal for 2026 is simple: **never smoke again**.

I’ve tried quitting before in 2024 and 2025 and failed, so I’m cautious but hopeful this time. I’m trying to focus not just on beating nicotine, but also breaking the habits.

Posting here to stay accountable, I know 3 days are nothing but its a step nevertheless. Any advice on staying strong during the next couple of weeks would really help.

Whether you've been a smoker longer or shorter than me (15+ years), or smoked more or less than me, (15-20 a day) you can do it. 

Quitting sucks, so make sure you only have to quit once instead of many times.

Ive said it many times here, but cold turkey was my method. No nicotine replacement therapy or smoking cessation aids. Just said no, and left it behind me. 

I believe everyone can do this. It's all in your mind.  Just put on your armour and push forward into this battle. Do not stumble. If you think you cannot do this, you're lying to yourself the same way the addiction lies to your brain.

Looking back on the years since my first cigarette, and I started at 20, I probably have half as many ""smoking years"" as non-smoking years. I'd smoke a few a day, up to a dozen depending on the timing, with a few pack-in-a-day days thrown in. My approach to quitting was to tell myself ""I fully intend to quit and when the time comes I will."" I would then quit for years at the time, only to pick one up and be back on the hook for six months to a year. I've quit for more than a year over and over, maybe ten times and I'm sure I took breaks of three to five years a few times along the way.  

This latest time I picked one up it was different. I'd buy a pack, smoke one, maybe two, maybe a couple of days in a row even. Then I wouldn't pull the pack out for a week, and that would just be for one with days between again. Last year, let's call it 12 months I bought maybe five or six packs.

It's been a couple of weeks since the last smoke and there's no attraction to opening the tobacco drawer. I'm not planning to flush the pack, something I've done several times, better to destroy them than going out to the garbage can I say. I take it back, I probably will destroy the pack, but I'm not in any hurry to. It just doesn't seem important like it always has in the past.

Instead of fighting urges head-on, I started treating them like short physiological events: a spike, a signal, then a drop. Simple things helped more than willpower — knowing *why* withdrawal feels the way it does, having a few 1-minute tools ready, and seeing the timeline of recovery made it feel manageable instead of overwhelming.

I ended up building a small, private web app for myself to structure this: learning the science, choosing a strategy (cold turkey vs taper), daily check-ins, and quick craving tools when needed. No accounts, no tracking — just something calm and factual to lean on when motivation dips.

3. Feeling energetic. The feeling of eternal lethargy has disappeared. (Although I did invest in some multivitamins so that helped too)
4. Don't wake up with a bad taste in mouth.
5. Teeth and gums health improved drastically. (Although I had to get scaling done twice)
6. Internal happiness that I am not dependant on cigarettes anymore!
7. Saved so much noticeable money every month. Bought a new guitar, invested in new earbuds, went on 2 trips from the money I saved!

It will always be a part of me and my brain will sometimes still think about it, but that doesn’t mean it’s something I still want or crave. 

I think smoking cravings can be viewed similarly after a certain amount of time. Obviously while going through the initial physical withdrawl, cravings can be very real. But I think once the nicotine has left your system, they can be viewed as intrusive thoughts.

I got into an argument with a family member the other night and had passing thoughts about both smoking and self harming. I was able to make the connection a few months back that in a way, I was using nicotine as a replacement for self harm for many years. It was an impulsive action that temporarily numbed or distracted me from whatever stressful situation I was facing. Now, as I am committed to quitting nicotine, I realized that these thoughts about smoking will probably come up for the rest of my life. Whenever I am facing a difficult or stressful situation, I might think about smoking. But that doesn’t mean I actually want to smoke. It’s almost like muscle memory for the brain. Finding healthier coping methods is so important - talking to a friend, listening to music, going for a walk, exercise, meditating, etc.

I just wanted to share this in case it resonates with anyone else’s journey. Let me know what you think!

1q3zkmd,"After 23 years, I've FINALLY stopped smoking cigs n' weed.","Sorry for the long text but I have a lot to say!

The past 4 years have been hell for me (39 M).  I had to get on very strong meds,  gained 50 pounds,  isolated myself from friends and family.  But i finally got something nice going for myself.  7 months ago, after 23 years of cigarette,  I finally quit.  Like that.  With no prep.

I got myself in a bad situation that required a big physical effort on my behalf.  After half an hour,  I got absolutely sick. Vomiting, low blood pressure,  I came within an inch to pass out, miles away from civilisation, in the forest.  Scary stuff, when you stop and think about the possible implications.  This situation left such a huge mark on me that the mental image of a smoke now repulses me.  I wouldn't have thought in a thousand year that such a situation would be the trigger that would get me to stop, but here I am!!! Now what helps a lot is that I almost don't drink anymore because of the meds. I have less than 10 drinks a year. I never get to that point where your mind inevitably wanders towards smoking when drinks are involved.  I am so grateful for that. 

I started smoking weed the same year I started cigarette, at 16 yo. My weed consumption was pretty uneven during the first decade.  I smoked socially,  but I was social... every day.  Then I went from smoking during the day,  to only smoking at night to help me sleep.  So since then,  I have smoked weed pretty much every night of my life before going to bed.  

Now fast-forward to last week,  I went to visit a family member for the new year. I forgot my G*d d*mn weed.  I was in a sadm village,  no dispensaries, no connection. Now normally I world have moved mountains to find some cuz I simply a Can't sleep without it.  But for some reason,  I mustered the strength to look at myself and say: let's do this,  now is the time to stop.  

I am happy and proud to report that I haven't had any since,  and that I'm officially on day 8 free of cannabis. I haven't had a good night of sleep since,  and I suspect it might take a good month to begin to see some normalcy sleepwear. I look like shit,  I'm a bit grumpy,  I have way too much coffee and I'm tired all the time,  but I'm holding strong. And I won't give up.

It's not relevant to this group,  but I'm also on my way to being done with my meds,  so I can start losing weight again.  The late night munchies won't be a factor anymore either,  so for the first time in years,  I'm looking forward to LIVING.

So that's my story.  I had to share it with someone. 
Thank you for your time,  and don't give up on yourself.  Your time WILL come. Maybe not today,  maybe not tomorrow. But they will!

Happy new year everyone!",1767556064.0,76,13,stopsmoking,substance

Flash forward to September 2024. I'm pushing 31, and the mounting stress from work finally wears me down and I ask my boss for a smoke, and of course he gives me one without a second thought. It's pizza delivery, I'm kinda surprised I lasted that long. Don't touch another for a two weeks, then another a week later, then I have 3 or 4 in a single day. I catch myself and throw my pack in the trash. Then fucking January hits and it starts to fully stick.

Come April, I get sick with who knows what, complete with nigh debilitating respiratory problems. After all the other symptoms go away I'm still spending half my time hacking up a lung. After almost a month I cave and go into urgent care. They give me an inhaler and some roids, and a week later I feel like a new man.

Summer and most of fall comes and goes without incident, which of course I use to justify enabling myself the whole time. Then late November hits and I do the whole rigamarole again, except I feel maybe half as good. Christmas Eve comes and the problems start rearing their ugly heads again. I get insurance through my work at the start of the year, so I'm really trying to just tough it out until then. 

At 3:00 a.m. on the 28th, I wake up with my breathing as bad as it had ever been. I'm looking up the hours for various places, just waiting until I can drive somewhere. 'Just a few more days, just a few more days'

Open hours hit, I'm lacing up my shoes to head out. I go back inside to grab my phone that I forgot, and suddenly I'm on the verge of collapse. I sit down at my front steps and call a friend to have them bring me to the hospital. They convince me to agree to an ambulance. While I'm in there they say my oxygen level is in the mid to low 70s, so I'm apparently about to fucking die.

Still in the hospital as I type. Doctors keep saying that while the smoking certainly didn't help, there's some underlying issue that it was probably exacerbating to hell and back.

I don't plan on doing a full course of NRT - I'll probably step down to 14 mg tomorrow. I've quit cold turkey before, so I'm not too worried about stepping down so quickly. My partner will keep using the patches as long as she needs, and her being less irritable will make my quitting MUCH easier! Her picking smoking back up is always what made me pick it back up too. Thankfully, we both have VERY IMPORTANT reasons that we absolutely *have* to quit, so the drive is definitely there!

I have a surgery I've been waiting years for (it's a gender-affirming surgery, I'm trans, this is something I want/need so much it makes me get super emotional). In October, I got surprise bumped to the top of the years-long waitlist and got my consult with my surgeon. He said we could get my surgery done in Spring... I just needed to have a negative nicotine blood test for my insurance before we could schedule the date. That was back in October. Every day/week/month I struggled with quitting set me back that much more on being able to feel comfortable in my body, to wear the clothes I actually want to wear, to be seen as the person I am.

So yep, I'll probably do about a week of patches, then early next month get my blood test. I don't want to draw it out any longer - I want to be able to wear comfortable, cool clothes during the heat of summer. I want to dress the way I want to for goth club nights, rather than either try to hide myself in baggy clothes or overheat in binding layers. I want to feel confident, not gross or like I'm just cosplaying as a guy. I want to be able to exercise and not have my chest get in the way.  The only thing stopping me at this point is nicotine, and I'm just so done with that.",1767483368.0,32,2,stopsmoking,substance

1q35wip,i feel like such a failure. i need advice.,"so just for a disclaimer, i am unfortunately a vaper and not a smoker </3 i had a week clean but i unfortunately relapsed as i didn't throw my vape out, only stashed it underneath the couch. i have been vaping for around five days now and i feel so fucking terrible. 

the idea of throwing out my vape makes me extremely anxious but i know i have to do this… i'm just pissed at the fact that i'll have to experience significant cravings once more. also, the withdrawal period always seems to exemplify my body dysmorphia somehow which causes me a huge amount of stress.

i feel hopeless. it seems like everyone who quits ends up relapsing eventually, even if that relapse comes after a few months or a year. UGH. but i suppose that even if i relapse, i'll still  have had a period without vaping which can never hurt.

i need some motivation or encouragement. i just feel like i will never be able to do this. also, i am a recovered heroin addict and whenever i quit, i experience extreme cravings for heroin. i have suboxone but it's still quite difficult and annoying. can someone please tell me that i can do this? or that i'll be okay? i'm somewhat freaking out >.>

I'm not sure if kids these days are experiencing the D.A.R.E. program like we used to, but that did sort of leave an impact on me. I used to think I would be sober forever and stay away from drugs... oh what a joke! Sometimes it even felt as if the program sometimes made me think more about drugs than I think I would have in a derogatory context rather than a simple health awareness.

I started smoking cigarettes at 21 at my friend's funeral and it was a complicated time. I smoked nearly consistently for 2 years and I am lucky I didn't smoke them for longer than that. I was smoking nicotine vapes from the age of 17 to 23 as well. Luckily I have stayed away from both since 2023.

As we enter 2026 I am so grateful to maintain my nicotine and also alcohol sobriety. I quit marijuana vapes a year later in 2024, as well. I will say, I was a functional addict and things were looking bleak for me. Things are much better these days. I'm also grateful to get a chance to speak on my experience at 25. Because I'm sober from so many substances that HAD harmed me in the past, I feel I bring the conversation of sobriety up everywhere I go. That is always an interesting time.

Anyway folks, if you read this far, thank you so much! Sending you all love and healing energy on your journeys. Hope that we can have some sort of dialog or conversation started.

I read Allan carrs easy way to quit smoking book a year ago. It was definitely insightful, but by the end of it I still couldn't manage to part with smoking my ciggs. I ended up going roughly 48 hours or shy of and caved and bought a pack.

Then I decided to use patches. I downloaded an app that showed my progress, and I made it 23 days with the help of the patch until I (stupidly) Made the choice to smoke because I was drinking alcohol (iykyk- to me,that's the ultimate combo to take me down) . I can drink my black coffee in the morning, eat meals, but if I throw alcohol in the mix, the cravings are intensified by over 9,000. By my second drink I became a beast and demanded ciggarettes. The next day I reset my app and my 23 days vanished, I woke up feeling raspy, and the weight of an elephant in guilt on me.Thus another year of smoking and saying ""welp I tried"". 

Start of 2026 I woke up to 5 ciggs left in a pack, so I thought ""if you got em smoke em"" and made those 5 last me till about 9 at night. Woke up yesterday and threw a patch on and repeated that this morning.  I already know going into this , I need to avoid alcohol until whenever I feel im comfortable to try again. 

Why do I feel so guilty though using patches to help me quit? Why can't I be like the braver ones who say "" just quit cold turkey, get the nicotine out entirely""? - I see all these success stories of people quitting cold turkey & I'm already feeling like im failing at quitting and its discouraging.  I don't feel im strong enough to quit cold turkey, and knowing im getting some form of nicotine right now helps me psychologically (even though I can FEEL  still withdrawl from my body) .

Healing and physical strength. Flexibility. I feel the clean oxygen flowing through me already, only after a couple days. I look forward to getting back into shape. 

Reintroduced myself to myself. Get to know me again. Emotional expiration and understanding authenticity. 

I will be a better lover.

1q2tk4r,To the brothers and sisters who'd like to stop.,"Apart from the ""real"", physical aspects of smoking the biggest part of the addiction happens between your ears. It's as if you have a little parasite (called nicotine) in your brain that wants to control what you do.

This begins (and kind of ends) with calling yourself a ""smoker"". So I think one of the first (and still biggest) steps one can make towards stopping smoking once and for all is to stop calling yourself a ""smoker"".

Think about it. Calling yourself a smoker makes it part of you. A defining trait thats nearly irrefutable.  
Being ""a smoker trying to quit"" gives the impression of ""missing out on"" or ""being under deprivation of"" something.

You are not. You are a person fighting a **really** bad habit that messes with your brain. Once you strip away the label of ""smoker"", the parasite loses its host. You aren't ""giving up"" a part of yourself, you are simply shedding a skin that never really fit in the first place.

My mom came back from the hospital from undergoing coronary angioplasty because she was also a chain smoker for 30 years but she quit a year before i did. She fell asleep on the couch because she didnt feel too great, i just looked at her thinking, how can i smoke around her knowing she has atherosclerosis from smoking, i felt bad. I just decided i wont smoke, my packet was empty and i didnt go out to get a new pack i just quit. 

Weeks went by, i saw it as a challenge, but i felt really shitty.

I have gastroparesis(paralyzed stomach) and everytime i attempted to quit smoking my gastroparesis would get alot worse, id get nasty flares and nausea and reflux… everytime i would go back to smoking it would go away. 

But this time i decided to just ride it out, see where this will bring me. Well 6 weeks after i quit smoking i suddenly couldnt swallow solid foods anymore, for months i was on a fully liquid diet (ensures, nutridrinks) had a manometry done and swallow study, got disgnosed with ineffective oesophageal motility(IEM), they cant help me they said just try and see what you can and cannot eat, which is mostly just very soft veggies purees and soups. My entire life flipped upside down and not to mention that on top of all of this im my fathers caretaker, he has alzheimers and life has been increasingly difficult for me. 

im on 40mg esomeprazol a day and i still have reflux and feel acid creeping up my oesophagus , i still have worsened stomach issues i still cant eat normal foods ive managed to eat purees and soft wet foods. 

I think this is why i still struggle with cravings, deep down i think if i smoke it will all be better.. like all the other times.

And not being able to eat whatever i want doubles down on my cravings, because its like im desperate for a dopamine kick, or that feeling of relief.. 

I get cravings so badly it feels sometimes as if i just quit 2 weeks ago, its weird.

1q1v98i,How to deal with the weight gain?,"Hello all, I stopped vaping in October. I never really smoked, but I've been vaping constantly for 3-4 years, from when I woke up to when I went to sleep. I didn't have any negative health impacts, but it bothered me that I'd think about how I could sneak in a quick vape, whether I'm at work, enjoying a nice meal, at a kids party, etc, and I wanted to be free from that. 

Quitting itself wasnt too hard, I was feeling a bit irritated and didnt sleep well for a couple of weeks, but that's it. 

However, my hunger, especially for sweets, frozen pizza, fried food, has exploded. I didnt really eat any chocolate before, i considered myself more of a savory person. Now I'm a bottomless pit. In the 3 months since I quit, I've gained 6kg and I want to eat everything constantly. 

To be honest, I found vaping less disruptive than weight gain and just eating all the time. I'm actually considering starting vaping again, because are the long-term effects of me becoming obese really better than me vaping? 

I'm not sure. I will try for another month or two, to see if the cravings subside and I get a better relationship with food, but it's really uncomfortable, none of my jeans fit anymore.

First time I quit/replaced normal cigs for vape, it lasted 1 year. Although vape made my lungs feel really heavy.. but then I had the craving and 'just this one' quickly led everyday smoking again! I dont want to pick up vape again. I do believe it's really bad.

The smell is so disgusting to me that I don't even want one,. Yet somehow Marlboro gave me coupons in the mail yesterday. Feels like a toxic ex trying to lure me back in lol. I also had a dream I smoked last night too which doesn't happen as much as it used to, but it was weird. It tasted and smelled exactly as I remembered it. 

Anyways, Im just happy to be off that shit. I didn't even post about quitting as I hit my habit from my family, which felt pathetic as I was legally old enough to, but considering my grandma died from lung cancer before I was born and my uncle died from emphysema 14 years ago, my Dad is HEAVILY against it. Rightfully so, but he was so strict about not smoking that he would have kicked me out of the house if he caught me smoking even if I was legally old enough to do so. 

Anyways, one of the biggest lessons I've learned is that there's no such thing as ""just one cigarette"", especially if you're an addict as it always leads to more. I started when I was 16 and quit when I was 18 due to heartburn issues. Then I started again at 22 doing it socially and became a regular smoker again at 23 until I quit during the pandemic at age 30. Now I'm 35 and almost 36 and it feels like I never smoked at times.

1q1aowi,Mental Struggle Post Quitting,"After two decades of smoking nearly a pack a day, I decided to quit cold turkey. I expected the hardest part to be the first 10–14 days—the period when my body would purge nicotine and I’d wrestle with physical withdrawal. And for a while, I was right. Those two weeks were tough, but once they passed, I experienced something incredible: the happiest week of my life. I felt detached from smoking, mentally stronger, free of physical cravings, and my mood was lighter than it had been in years.  

But then everything changed. For the past 35 days, my life has felt like it’s unraveling. I’ve been hit with emotional explosions—anger, depression, and tears that come without warning. It’s not about craving cigarettes; it’s something deeper. My temper has cost me friendships, and now my family is at risk too. My mood swings feel magnified threefold, and my mind never stops racing—like ten browser tabs open at once, even while I sleep.  

Each day, the swings worsen. The depression deepens. I cry often. Yesterday, after an argument with my wife, I screamed into a pillow and then broke down—I smoked a single cigarette. For a moment, it calmed me, but the relief quickly turned into regret.  

I don’t understand why this is happening. Has anyone else gone through this? How long does this storm last? I was proud to have quit for 55 days, but now it feels like everything is slipping out of my control. I know life is better without smoking—I don’t want to go back—but right now, my body and mind are struggling to cope. I’m 38 years old, and I’m fighting to hold on.

I’m 23 now, and recently my friends were trying THC drinks. I was really nervous but tried a small amount and actually had a good experience.

My boyfriend used to smoke a lot and sometimes smokes before bed, so the past few nights I tried taking a small hit before bed and playing video games. It was genuinely relaxing and felt fine. Last night, though, I didn’t think I was feeling it as much, so I asked if I could take one more hit than usual — and that was a huge mistake.

I completely lost it. Full-blown spiral: felt like nothing was real, intense fear, convinced I was going to die. I was in the shower and freezing cold water just shivering because I couldn’t feel it. I know now I was way too high. The problem is today I’m still struggling to feel “back to normal.” I feel detached, kind of numb, and like reality hasn’t fully snapped back.

I stopped smoking over 7months ago (25/05/2025). This is my first post here, but I’ve been lurking all this time everyday.

On that day I just walked out to buy cigarettes and changed direction. I went to the pharmacy instead and bought Cytisine. I just had a brief moment of courage and decided “why not”. And I’m so glad I did…

Cytisine helped, but this community helped even more. Knowing other people were fighting the same battle mattered on the hardest days. My girlfriend was also a constant source of support.

As time went by I expected people to notice. At work, with friends, in daily life, but most just didn’t. That surprised me. What surprised me more was how some smoker “friends” reacted. Once they knew, a few simply faded away. No encouragement. No acknowledgment. 

It was hard. Much harder than I had admitted to myself before starting. I fought cravings, habits, moods, excuses. There were days where the only win was not giving in.

Today I feel incredible and so proud of myself and all of you.

I smoked for 25years and was completely done with it, but stopping was such a struggle, so with the guidance of my doctor I started taking champix. In the first 2 weeks it all went ok, I had some disturbing dreams and was nauseous for about an half hour after taking each pill but that was it.

But then slowly I started falling into a depression, crying for days, dead wishes, thinking about suicide all the time, at first I didn't realise it was because of champix, and I kept on taking them, because I finally quit smoking and that was such a win! 

But things were getting weirder and weirder, I went out a couple of times, and had major blackouts, after hearing stories about my functioning during these blackouts it was as if I became a completely different person, saying really mean things to my beloved once... this happened 3 times and the last time was really scary and shocking, I immediately went to my doctor and quit the medication.

I’d really love to hear what you did when the emotions got too intense and you felt yourself reaching for a cigarette. What I actually want is to learn healthier coping mechanisms.

1pzwf5p,Quitting smoking from Jan 1 — stopping before chronic damage becomes the baseline,"I’m quitting smoking from Jan 1.

I’m 32. I’ve smoked roughly a pack a day for \~9 years, with occasional pot on and off. I originally picked up smoking in college — honestly, as a style statement to look cool — and what started as that quietly turned into a long-term habit. Last year, I was diagnosed with mild asthma, which was the first real signal that this wasn’t harmless anymore.

What’s bothering me now isn’t some abstract health scare. It’s understanding how smoking drives chronic inflammation, impairs lung repair, increases airway reactivity, and slowly resets your “normal” breathing and energy levels — even when you’re still functioning day to day. That kind of damage doesn’t announce itself; it just becomes your baseline.

I’ve already stressed my body enough. I don’t want to reach a point where quitting is forced by declining health rather than choice.

I’ll be honest — I’m still second-guessing myself. The urges are there. But I don’t want my nervous system running my decisions anymore.

Things in my life are actually going well.. got married last year, which is exactly why I want to quit now, while reversal is still realistic.

I want to be a better parent to my dog Bruno, a better husband to my wife, and someday a better father.

Posting this here for accountability.

If you quit before hitting rock bottom, I’d appreciate hearing what helped you through the early phase.

Jan 1 it is.

1pzq0a3,Physical withdrawal symptoms no one warns you about,"I originally left this as a comment on someone’s post but while I was writing it I remembered how hard it was looking for someone else who could relate to me since every time I googled nicotine withdrawal symptoms I got the standard, “cravings, anger, insomnia, headaches, etc.” while those are all valid symptoms, for me they were no where near the worst. I’m posting this here so that if anyone else has these symptoms they know they are not alone and it does get better. 

I smoked/vaped about 7 years then switched to zyns when my child was born. Used those for a couple years then got some heart palpitations and decided to quit cold turkey. While it doesn’t sound like much it was essentially an IV drip of nicotine where I had a constant intake at all times of the day and when I switched to zyns, I had it during sleep too. Not on purpose, but the way I had done it I had already broken the addition of hand to mouth by using the zyns so the actual cravings for me didn’t last longer than about a week. 

The physical symptoms on the other hand lasted months and sucked bad. (I might get some of the science wrong because it’s been a while but the gist is here) nicotine works on your nervous system and activates your body’s fight or flight. I’m anxious by nature so the increased anxiety from the shock to my nervous system hit me hard and made the rest of the physical symptoms last longer than normal because I became hyper aware of my body and all symptoms. 

The first 2 weeks were the worst because I felt like I was having a heart attack every day. Chest pain and tightness, aggressive palpitations, trouble breathing. I went to the doctor got hooked up to a 24 hour monitor of my heart and some blood and oxygen tests and… perfectly healthy, it’s all in my head. (I ended up buying the new Apple Watch to track blood oxygen and heart rate on my own for anxiety relief). 

Around weeks 2-4 those symptoms toned down a lot and while noticeable, became much more manageable. I noticed certain greasy foods would increase my chances of having trouble breathing and sugar would give me palpitations. I stayed away from alcohol caffeine and other stimulants during the first month and a half. 

It should be noted that the trouble breathing was completely benign, felt like I was trying to yawn but could never get a satisfied breath it has something to do with the nervous system being shocked. 

Around weeks 5/6 the breathing and heart problems faded from daily manageable occurrences into specific responses to certain stimuli only. However a new symptom had started to develop. Around this time my lungs and throat were starting to recover and mucus was being made tenfold to overcompensate. Deep breaths felt like breathing in through a wet rag and nasal drip became the new norm with the occasional persistent cough and aggressive throat clearing. 

Right around 2 months the acid reflux started. This sucked a lot because I’d just gotten over the beginning symptoms and the mucus was getting worse and now every time I ate I felt like I had to throw up. Burping and farting increased from 1 a day to maybe 6 times after each meal and before bed. I felt like I was swallowing extra air and the pressure caused stomach pain and queasiness until relief came in the form of releasing the air. 

These new symptoms peaked around 3 months, but they really peaked. I couldn’t eat without immediately feeling nauseous due to the air and mucus and reflux. I also would wake up with mucus pooled in my sinuses and head and nose so every morning was a fit of coughing and clearing all the crap out through hot showers. I felt foggy headed and queasy most days and I really had to watch what I was eating. I also had a really dry throat for some reason, I wasn’t able to pin this down on anything but I found myself choking or struggling more than normal to swallow dry things like toast. 

There were other symptoms I’m forgetting but these were the big ones I remember that convinced me never to ever go back because I don’t want to experience that ever again. There were also flare ups where some mixture of those symptoms would pop up for a day or two then fade out but these majority symptoms steadily declined after 3 months and were essentially gone by 6 months. I know not everyone had the same experience as me but I was terrified because I struggled to find others who could relate to me. I had no idea about all these physical symptoms and how long they would last. That was by far the worst part for me.

I had been vaping very heavily for about 3 years, I smoked for a year before that. Starting smoking at 23 was probably amongst the most moronic things I had ever done. A smoke here, a smoke there, I could smoke all night at a party and have zero desire for a smoke the next morning. Idk if I thought I was immune or something, but eventually, the day came, and I bought a pack. That pack lasted a week. The next, half that long, before you knew it, I was hooked. 

Eventually got off the smokes and moved over to vaping, that lasted a little over 3 years. I was vaping a 20ml pod every few days, it was expensive as hell and I could feel it catching up to me. 

22 days ago at 8:30PM I put the vape in my night side table, I wanted to prove to myself I could finish the night without it. The next morning I left for work and left it behind. Thus began 2-3 very difficult days. 

I could think of nothing but vaping. A recording on repeat of excuses ran through my head like “you didn’t get to have one real last puff” “you just bought that $40 pod” “ask your coworker for a smoke to take the edge off”. There were a cocktail of symptoms.

I did find myself bragging to some family that I didn’t get moody or cranky at all. My partner sweetly told me that was most certainly not the case for a few days but she remained sweet and supportive for me knowing I was struggling.

Like i’m very loosely connected to the world around me. Everything simultaneously feels like background static noise, and is super overstimulating at the same time. I have a dragging drowsiness. I feel like my processing is slower, and I’m moving and reacting slower than I typically do. I’m also consistently waking up with pounding headaches. Has anyone else dealt with these symptoms? Do they go away with time? Or will they just get worse? Is it worth it to continue the medication for the full course?

1pyc38m,"Recovering addict & ex-smoker (14+ yrs clean, 10+ yrs smoke-free) — building a quit-smoking program, looking for guidance & support","Hi everyone,

I’m posting here with honesty and humility.

I’m 37 years old, based in Delhi, India. I’m a recovering drug addict with 14+ years of continuous recovery, and an ex-smoker who has been smoke-free for over 10 years.

Quitting wasn’t just about willpower for me. What actually worked was de-conditioning — breaking identity, emotional triggers, and the mental loops that kept pulling me back. Over the years, I’ve helped a few people informally, and now I want to build something more structured.

I’m in the early stages of creating an online quit-smoking academy focused on:
	•	Psychological de-conditioning (not scare tactics)
	•	Identity shift (from “trying to quit” to “non-smoker”)
	•	Handling cravings, relapse thoughts, and emotional triggers
	•	Long-term freedom, not short streaks

I’m not selling anything here.
Right now, I’m genuinely looking for:
	•	Feedback from ex-smokers: what actually helped you quit?
	•	Insights on what you wish quit programs did differently
	•	Ideas for structuring a program that feels real, not gimmicky
	•	Accountability and motivation as I build this honestly

If you’re an ex-smoker, in recovery, or someone who’s tried multiple times — I’d really value your perspective.

Thanks for reading.
Grateful for any guidance or conversation.

I can breathe easier, walk without feeling winded, sing badly in the car without coughing, and not constantly worry about smelling like smoke.

I still don’t know what made this attempt different. Maybe timing, maybe mindset, maybe just being tired of starting over. Either way, I’m proud of myself.

1py4slb,Don't wanna take my chances,"Hey guys, im 20 years old and have been smoking since i was 15 years old.

A couple months ago, i felt a almost golfball sized lump in my breast (don't ask, i have no idea how i didn't notice it, before it got to that size  xD).
Considering the rapid growth, my smoking habit and my luck, i was totally convinced i had cancer.

During the whole process of making an appointment, getting ultrasound imaging done, having a biopsy and waiting for the lab-results, all i rememberd feeling was shame.
I didn't tell my family (who i live with) anything, because i genuinley though, they'd just blame me and add to the embarrassment, that i already felt on my own.

Well it turned out to be a benign tumour and i was infact lucky.
It really felt like i was given a second chance and i knew i just had to quit.

Now some time has passed and i had a lot going on in the past few weeks. I lost my focus and only was able to reduce to 2 - 6 cigarettes per day.

Recently for some reason tho, i really have been thinking about that shame i felt and how i never ever want to feel like that again.

So i have decided to fully quit starting tomorrow. 

Because when im smoke-free and i ever do run out of luck with my health, i'd at least know, i tried my best to prevent it.
(People also couldn't give me shit for it and i could just blame the universe for condemning me)

However, I am still a little worried about the toll it'll take on us considering what we have is still very new, though a bit of the reason he's quitting is because he wants to be a better man, also for me.

I’m looking for advice on how to help my mom quit smoking.

She’s over 60 and has been smoking for more than 30 years. She has tried quitting several times, always cold turkey and without medical support, but she always relapsed. She’s still working and her job is quite stressful, which I know makes quitting harder.

We are based in Europe, so I’m also wondering if there’s a reliable place to order it, or if it’s better to talk to her doctor about prescribing something (Desmoxan, Champix, nicotine replacement, etc.).

More generally, what actually helped you or your loved ones quit after decades of smoking? At this point, I’d honestly already be happy if she could just reduce the number of cigarettes, not necessarily quit all at once.

I know she has to want to quit herself, I’m not trying to force her. I just want to be supportive and informed. She means a lot to me, and I really want to help her break free from this addiction.

I’m eating apples and grapes to keep my blood sugar steady. I’m drinking more water than I ever thought possible. I’m tired, I’m achy, and my brain is trying to trick me into being scared of my own recovery.

But I’m not dying. I’m waking up.

In less than 18 hours, I hit the 300-HOUR mark. That’s a number I couldn't even imagine two weeks ago. If you’re in the first few days and you feel like you’re falling apart - stay the course. The ""weird"" feelings, the sweats, and the anxiety are just the sounds of your body repairing the damage.

I don't even want to smoke anymore. I just want to finish this reset. I hope I can find people with similar experience and motivate other to quit vaping as going through the battle I am going through is worth it! ",1766786220.0,40,3,stopsmoking,substance

1pw2zlo,Job done. Signing off!,"It has been over a year since any nicotine has entered my body.  There are no cravings and my mind is clear and free.  It has been a long junky journey.  From switching from smokes to vapes for 8 years. To sweating almost all of it out with that junky voice screaming in my ears (month 3-4 was the hardest).  To the several joints with a tiny bit of tobacco that I smoked everyday for years (never more than 1 cigarette a day).  To the final year when no really did mean no.  

As my mind got clearer and clearer without nicotine I could feel all my other addictions and compulsions for the first time.  I've largely stopped drinking and now the phone is going to be used for phoning and texting only.  So goodbye Reddit.  And thanks to the sub for some good advice in the early times.

My advice is to let the demon in.  Don't don't talk to it, don't argue with it but hear what it says.  The longer you go without nicotine the more desperate and nasty it gets.  See that demon as what you need to get out of yourself.  He's not your friend, he's an evil dick.  When he made me cry, I hated him for it and I knew I'd won and he'd overplayed his hand.

1pvanx1,Best ways to start?,"Hello! Fairly new, hardly ever post.

I am 30, soon to be 31. Ive been smoking since I believe 2019 so going on 7 yrs? Maybe 6 actually. My ex got me hooked on vapes shortly after my youngest was born. Then when the e liquid got too expensive I switched to cigarettes. Been smoking ever since. So let's say 1yr vaping and 5yrs smoking. Menthol every chance I get 

Around 2-3yrs in I was able to get nicotine patches that allowed me to ""quit"" for a week or two. Can't even remember what happened that made me pick back up. 

I have plenty of motivation to stop, 3 beautiful kids, lovely boyfriend who encourages me to quit but doesn't nag. Parents who do nag, but they mean well. And recently, surprisingly not before now, I seem to have developed the smokers cough.

I know I'm doing horrible things to my body and my health and unintentionally my kids health (I try not to smoke around them). My 10yr old bombards me with ""facts about smoking"" almost daily.

I WANT to quit. But I'm not sure how to even begin. I've tried cold turkey, it makes my anxiety skyrocket and my mood/attitude plummet. I cannot be a good mom while attempting cold turkey, I've tried numerous times 

I know most of this is habit and mental addiction more than physical addiction. But no idea where to start. 

I feel it helps with stress, focus, boredom, I use it as a reward after a difficult task, I smoke immediately after eating. 

On that note, I can't afford weight gain, already obese and diabetic. It's not currently well controlled due to lapse in health insurance. 
I have no friends who've successfully quit however I am not typically around the friends that do smoke. 

My goal is to set a plan in place and (hopefully) call it quits in the new year 

I have an extreme amount of stress and mental health issues
Such as
Moving
Being unemployed 
Kids with issues(depression, suicidal ideation, PTSD, anxiety, ADHD, scoliosis, urology issues, chronic insomnia, learning disabilities)
My own issues(depression, anxiety, ADHD, psychosis at times, diabetes, overweight/obese)
The holidays (they bring us all stress)
Divorce (tax time, been separated awhile)

There's plenty more, but those are top ones.

I am needing cheap/free options. I don't have any income (other than child support). I do not know how to handle the mental addiction and habit. 

I have tried Füm, it helped me cut back...but at some point it just makes me mad cause the flavor is there, the habit is there, but I don't get the nicotine when I think I need it. 

Unfortunately at the moment I'm at more than a pack per day. Again because my brain thinks it helps with stress. 

I apologize for the rant. I just need a plan. I need help starting. I need something. If I could quit right now I would. I'm hoping with a plan it'll help my anxiety. (Definitely a planner)

Any advice is GREATLY appreciated.

I’ve seen a lot of horror stories on here about chantix side effects and I wanted to share some info about dosing that I was told by my excellent doctor. She said that most doctors prescribe the “starter pack” which increases the dosage to the maximum amount within a very short time. In her experience (and now in mine) it’s enough for some people to stick with the lowest/lower dosage for the duration, especially if you weren’t an extremely heavy smoker. It seems that even pharmacists are hesitant to just give a patient the small dose rather than the starter pack. My pharmacy went so far as to call my doctor to confirm that she didn’t intend to prescribe the starter pack.

I was smoking about half a pack a day and I stuck with the initial 0.5mg dose. I have had a pretty painless time quitting for 1.5 months after never being able to make it more than a day and very much struggling previously to quit.

I wanted to share this info because I found chantix so helpful but there seem to be a lot of side effects if you take the higher dose recommended by the starter pack.

Put it all in the outside trash with a bunch of food waste in the bag so it's as gone as gone can be. I even double-checked every old purse and tote bag to make sure there weren't any wayward pouches hanging around.

I read most of the Freedom From Nicotine book online from whyquit, and then I got the quitsure app and did the 6 day program. Super cheesy but I did it in good faith with an open mind, feeling more ready than I ever have.

I did it. I'm done. I know it may not be as easy to say this in another couple of hours or couple of days, or maybe even a couple of months, but I honestly believe that I'm done. I know there is nothing good about smoking/nicotine and that there are so many things that will be better without it (health, money, etc). 

My hubby quit too, we had our last smoke together and worked together to empty all the ashtrays and dump the rest of the tobacco out. I know I can't rely on him for my success (or vice versa) but I'm grateful to move along this path with him.

I appreciate all the success stories posted here, and seeing all the folks helping other folks through their struggles. So I just want to post this so I can come back later with more updates of my success.

Obviously I’ve thought about smoking a lot since I’ve quit but this past month it seems to have gotten a new energy. I haven’t had one, I’ve drank alcohol probably 7 times since then and one night I almost took one but didn’t. 

I smoked for over half my life so it’s just so ingrained in to my psyche. I miss it but I don’t miss the cost or health issues it causes. How long does this misery of longing last for? I thought by 4months I still wouldn’t be fixated like this. Seems like I was in a better place 2 months ago.",1766506761.0,17,9,stopsmoking,substance
1ptwr4g,Is quitting worth it?,"I (16F) made the stupid decision to start smoking tarts in october with my friend (16F). I wasn’t really able to get into smoking until halloween when me and my bsf of over 2 years broke up (16M). Every since halloween I’ve been smoking multiple times a day. Usually before school, during school, and after school. At the time it helped me fill the void of his absence but recently I’ve been talking to someone and we might actually be something. I like him a lot but I just have too much going on, I’m constantly in à state of isolation and genuinely don’t enjoy constantly having to deal with someone. Maybe it’s because the ex-bestfriend was the center of my life for so long that I’ve finally reached a place in life where my pleasure is my own concern. Recently my friend’s mom (thé friend I originally started smoking with) told her that she doesn’t want me around anymore because she saw me smoking. Not sure on the “saw me smoking” part because no tf you haven’t? My friend reassured me that I was good and to continue smoking. I don’t know why but in that moment I decided to go cold turkey. I’m 16, active in my community/ school, 4.0 gpa and love working with kids. I don’t want my life to be ruined. I enjoyed smoking at first ( 1st week ) but eventually it became habit and not as pleasurable. It’s likely because I never consumed a lot at one time because I’d gag really hard after inhaling. Ive went cold turkey but honestly have regrets. It’s holiday season and I want to feel good yk? BUT it’s not worth the risk of my parents finding out and doesnt make me feel happy anymore. Instead of feeling happy from smoking I’ve started to feel anxious and paranoid. I’m going to give my body the opportunity to grow fully then I’ll revisit smoking later in life. I’m not sure if I’m being overly paranoid about stopping because my parents haven’t found out yet so why would they find out now.

1ptimzh,Two weeks down..,"I never thought I'd get this far again..

Now that ive made it this long ive vowed to never let myself be stupid and allow myself to get back into consuming nicotine.

I was so addicted, I would throw a vape out only to dig it back out of the trash. I would throw so many vapes out in public, that i once spent over 800 dollars in a month on vapes.

At that point I knew my mental health was getting worse along with my anxiety and existential dread.

I got an appointment with my doctor and got prescribed Varenecline. I haven't had any terrible aide effects besides vivid dreams, but I love dreaming. 

Since I quit, I noticed a few great things.

My heart rate has significantly went down. (Usually sat between 110-130+ at work and now stays below 100)

My anxiety has rapidly decreased. 

I feel more relieved and not rushed anymore.

I feel happier and more confident.

I am more present / aware (it's almost like I had brain fog for years and the fog just lifted..)

Its like a light switch flipped and im almost back to how i was before I picked up smoking / vaping in 2018...

I'm also allowing myself to smile more and be less judgemental of myself, not as rigid and miserable.

I've noticed now I can just sit happily reading a book or just watching the sky / anything around me and be content where im at.

That's all I have to say.. I was so addicted I didnt realize I was using nicotine to avoid facing the reality of why i was so miserable and I that so desperately wanted to be free of the substance my brain was hooked on.",1766458019.0,25,3,stopsmoking,substance

I’ve had an ok experience so far, apart from the anger and occasional relapses I’m confident I can cut it out completely. 

I am however experiencing the worst night time cough… it starts after about an hour of laying down in bed before going to sleep. It never happens during the day.
I have to sit up, make a hot drink or just get out of bed for a while and stand & the cough will eventually go. It’s so annoying for me and my partner. I really hope it doesn’t last long but I’ve heard it can be a common symptom of quitting.

I’ve smoked for years and every quit attempt failed because I tried to go cold turkey and white-knuckle it.

This time I’m doing it differently. I’m using Quitine Lozenges 2mg to taper it down instead of shocking my system all at once. It’s not magic but it takes the edge off enough that I can actually think during cravings.

What I’m learning so far: cravings don’t disappear fast, but they do get weaker if you don’t feed them. 

I’m treating each craving like a rep at the gym. It sucks, but it builds something.

If anyone here has tapered successfully, I’d love to hear what helped you stay consistent when motivation dipped.

I quit smoking a little over 4 years ago. It was not easy, but eventually it clicked. I maintained relationships with people that smoked, often going outside them when they went out for one. I tried to have an approach to not be judgemental but to be supportive and understanding even if they weren't attempting or ready to quit...to respect their choice. I dont know if I was right, now i know even less. But I can tell you now in hindsight im really glad I never let MY choice to quit smoking interfere with the relationship or time I spent with my dad. 

I just wanted to share this. I know January 1st is coming soon and there will be more than usual amount people starting their journey. Its a long road with lots of lessons. It can be incredibly difficult. But it is possible to quit and have a high quality life. 

If you're struggling to quit for yourself or your own reasons....remember the impact of your life on the ones that love you. They love you more than you think. More than they even think. And without you there's gonna be a huge empty space that cant be filled. Keep your head up, keep trying. It does get easier, a new normal does get established.

1psy1n3,Celebrating 1 year of freedom,"Last week, I was reminiscing on my life and on my journey in giving up drug usage. Honestly, it hasn’t been easy fighting drug addiction. It took a lot of determination, counseling, therapy, and support to be completely free. I came in contact with drugs at a very tender age, and since then, I started experimenting with different hard substances. This eventually led me to become so dependent and addicted to drugs that I couldn’t function properly without inhaling or just taking something just to feel normal. 

Back then, I had various glass filter tips, so I was able to get the best out of some of the substances that I was taking. I don’t miss that life, actually, I’m genuinely happy and proud of the person I have become in 1 year. This journey wasn’t an easy one, but it was liberating. Now I have real-life responsibilities and a future I care about. All these require that I take my life seriously and focus on the things that truly matter. 

So, to appreciate myself for a complete 1 year of staying away from anything that smokes or consumes substances, I am going to give myself something really nice.

3. Fatigue 

4. Dehydration 

5. Awful blood circulation (when I would bend over I felt instant rush of blood to my head. Constant feeling of tingles)

13. Waking up every single morning at 5:30am

14. I would eat my meals in portions. Smoking gave me an appetite. One whole meal could last me 3 servings for the day. 

15. Constant nausea, throwing up, typically when I wake up, once I threw up the acid in my tummy I instantly felt relived. 

16. Major brain fog.

1psea2u,"Why does no one talks about the moments when you’re sad, crying, depressed, lonely and just want to puff during those times?","I posted on here before about scaling down nicotine and it’s going surprisingly well all things considered. I’ve gone from half a pack a day to about 3-4 per day. Many of you will be shocked to know I only smoke at night so basically I spend the next 23 hours withdrawing but it doesn’t even feel like it to me. It’s just something I’m used to. Ofc I look forward to my evenings alone, sitting on the porch while puffing away with a glass of scotch in the other hand. It’s when I reflect on the day that passed and sometimes, as the title of this post I get deeply emotional about life stressors and events. 

Hear me out here. 

When I sit alone in the evening smoking and thinking (I get really in my head a lot) I DONT KNOW HOW TO PROCESS THOSE FEELINGS of sadness and depression without nicotine. No, I am not always depressed or lonely but I process stress in the evenings and since nicotine has been such a part of this routine, what am I going to do without it? I am not joking with this question, I assure you. 

Let me give you one example, every few nights or so, I light up and talk to my dead mother (not out loud haha), I think of the memories I’ve had with her, I laugh, I cry, I process difficult emotions. With each drag of the poison. 

So what do you people do during those moments of self reflection and feeling the feels like grieving?

🐺 PROJECT: THE PACK
Subtitle: Never Quit Alone — Cohort-Based Addiction Recovery
1. Executive Summary
The Pack is a mobile application designed to solve the isolation and high failure rates associated with quitting smoking. Unlike traditional solo trackers, The Pack utilizes a Cohort-Based Support model. It instantly groups users who decide to quit at the exact same time into small, manageable groups called ""Packs."" By shifting the focus from individual willpower to collective accountability, the app transforms a solitary struggle into a shared team mission.
2. Core User Experience
2.1 The Zero-Hour Onboarding
The app begins with a minimalist interface featuring a single, high-stakes button: ""I Quit Today."" When a user presses this, the backend matching engine scans for other users who have joined within a specific time window (ranging from one hour to 24 hours). Once a group is formed, users are introduced to their specific ""Pack."" They immediately see the avatars or profiles of the 10–15 people starting their journey at the exact same moment.
2.2 The Command Center (Dashboard)
The dashboard focuses on collective metrics rather than just individual stats, reinforcing the idea that your success helps the team.
 * The Pulse: A live ""Active Now"" indicator showing how many Pack members are currently online or holding strong.
 * Team Coffers: A real-time ticker displaying the total amount of money saved by the entire Pack since their start time.
 * Oxygen Meter: A collective health milestone tracker (e.g., ""The Pack has collectively regained 200 hours of lung health"").
 * Pack Chat: A persistent, dedicated thread for venting, celebrating, and daily check-ins.
3. Key Support Mechanisms
3.1 The S.O.S. Flare
When a user experiences a severe craving, they can trigger an S.O.S. Flare. This action pushes a high-priority notification to all other Pack members, signaling that a teammate is in trouble. The app then opens a temporary ""Crisis Room"" chat window. Once the user feels the craving has passed, they hit ""I'm Safe,"" and the entire Pack earns a ""Resilience Point.""
3.2 Pack Fusion (Liquidity Logic)
To prevent the ""Ghost Town"" effect when members drop off or relapse, the app uses a Fusion Protocol. If a Pack’s activity falls below a certain threshold (e.g., 30%), the app automatically merges two thinning Packs that share the same ""Quit Date."" A special ""Welcome Ceremony"" interface is triggered to help the two groups integrate and introduce themselves.
3.3 The Phoenix Rise (Relapse Protocol)
The Pack removes the shame of a relapse to keep users engaged. If a user slips up, they are given two options:
 * Stay as a Supporter: Remain in their current Pack as an observer to offer encouragement to others.
 * The Phoenix Rise: Reset their timer and join a brand-new ""Day 1"" Pack immediately. The user's ""Legacy Status"" (total cigarettes avoided in the past) is preserved as a badge of honor so their previous progress isn't erased.
4. Advanced Safety and Retention
4.1 Sentiment AI and Trigger Filters
The app utilizes lightweight AI to monitor chat for ""spiral language"" or extreme negativity. If the group sentiment drops, the app intervenes by surfacing success stories or reminding the group of their collective wins. Additionally, Trigger Blur technology automatically blurs any images containing cigarettes or smoking paraphernalia to protect members from visual triggers.
4.2 The Guardian System
To keep long-term users engaged after they have successfully quit, the app introduces the Guardian Role at the 6-month mark.
 * Mentorship: Guardians can ""adopt"" a new Pack to provide stability and advice during the critical first 72 hours of withdrawal.
 * Exclusive Perks: Guardians unlock real-world wellness rewards and premium app themes as a thank-you for their service to the community.
5. Success Metrics
The effectiveness of The Pack will be measured by three primary data points:
 * The 7-Day Hold: The percentage of users who remain smoke-free for the first week.
 * Flare Resolution: The percentage of S.O.S. Flares that end with a successful ""I'm Safe"" status.
 * Pack Longevity: The average length of time a Pack stays active before requiring a Fusion merger.

1pscii5,Help Me Build an App to Quit Smoking! 😊,"Hi everyone, I'm working on a quit smoking app and I'd love your input. As someone who's been through the struggle, I know how tough it can be to quit. My app aims to help track progress, manage cravings and provide support.

One of the key features I'm working on is a 'Reduce Gradually' tracker.  That help you by setting your current smoking level (e.g., 10 sticks/day), and the app will guide you to cut down gradually (e.g., 10 >> 8 >> 6 >> ... >> 0!). Would this be helpful to you?

I’ve tried nicotine patches before, but they give me really intense nightmares, so I’m looking for an alternative. I usually smoke my first cigarette pretty much as soon as I wake up, and I average around 15 cigarettes a day.

For those who used lozenges successfully:

	•	Did they actually work for you (cravings, irritability, staying quit)?

	•	If you did a “full program” (like \~12 weeks), roughly how many lozenges did you go through?

	•	Based on my smoking pattern, would 4mg make more sense than 2mg?

I (M40) followed Allen Carr EasyWay to stop smoking. Read the book and took the course and it worked wonders! Went from a daily smoker for 20 years to not smoking at all in daily life. 

However, I do enjoy a drink once in a while, and when drinking it all comes crashing back. I never smoke in daily life, but when drinking I smoke. I don’t continue smoking the day after, but on the other hand, I can easily smoke 20+ on a night out. Which ofcourse horribly bad.

1prpl75,I'm relapsing :( and this time my health can't afford it,"This morning I hacked up some yellow mucus for the first time in a long time and begrudgingly accepted it like an old friend.
 
I smoked for about 6 years, cigs and weed several times a day. I was finally able to stop nicotine mid 2023 by phasing it out with zyns and mints. And I switched to THC drinks for the most part and cut back. I'd hit a joint at a party every once in a while. But around Thanksgiving I broke down and bought a vape and have spiraled since. 

It didn't help that my bf spotted some Nat Sherman's at a gas station. I have a sentimental attachment to them bc we shared some of their rairbow cigs at my friend's birthday party right before covid. It was my last memory of normal before it all and that friend had to move away. I had been trying to find some Sherman's since they stopped being produced 2020 but never found them before I quit. 

I'm starting to get that feeling again. When I was smoking I was so aware that I was just surviving and didn't care that I was causing harm to my body in the process. As I lit up I'd think about my family members you've died of lung cancer and felt the twinge in my right lung and then shoved those thoughts aside bc I had to feel okay right now and didn't have the capacity to care. I had just started caring about myself again (bc I was forced to - details below) but now I can feel myself giving up again and settling for survival, not health. 

2025 was a really sad and scary year for me, and it was definitely made worse by the damage I had done smoking. I got terribly ill in March, at one point I really was on the brink of death, and it did so much long term damage. The progression was partially due to factors outside my control, but my smoking (+ poor diet + lack of medical care for so long) had weakened parts of my body that then got shredded by the illness.

I've been diagnosed with Crohn's and a chronic nerve disease this year, both of which I was genetically disposed to, but were aggravated at a low level for so long by smoking that it was so bad when they flared. 

So I really can't afford to relapse right now. I can feel it ramping my pain and anxiety back up. I was clawing myself back towards healing but now I'm stalled and fully aware it's bc of the cigs but I can't will myself to stop. 

I forgot how good and fast lungs get substances into the blood. 

I'm also starting to overeat again :(

1prj8mw,Severe Withdrawal Symptoms after quitting for 4 months,"Desperately searching for a way I can quit smoking!

Before I get into this I want to clarify something important to me quitting. I am diagnosed bi-polar I, General Anxiety Disorder, PTSD, and HPPD (Hyper Persistent Psychedelic Disorder). I take Caplyta and lithium for depression and mania as well as propranolol for anxiety. I also take klonopin as needed for anxiety attacks (rarely).

I have habitually smoked a pack a day since I was 15 years old. I’m 31 and smoke between 1.5 to 2.5 packs a day currently. I have quit for extended periods of time in the past to the point of not wanting them at all (yet somehow I let myself get sucked back in to them 😞). I’ve used methods to quit like setting and reducing limits of cigarettes till I smoke zero a day with success. I’ve used chantex in the past with success. I tried chantex about a year and a half ago and it made me so angry and unstable it was almost dangerous for me. I came off of it immediately. I took Wellbutrin after the chantex but not only did it do nothing to curb the cigarette cravings it caused a severe manic episode. I came off of it incrementally. I’ve also used nicotine patches successfully in the past.

Finally, in January of 2025 I used the step down method limiting and reducing the number of cigarettes I smoke a day till zero. By January 9th I was cigarette free and actually feeling ok just mild irritability and headaches. Then there was a final family Christmas party on January 18th that sent me spiraling out of control. My nephews were running around being loud like kids do. Normally i wouldn’t think twice about it. But the anger that filled me was IMMENSE. I wanted to snatch them up and yell at them. It was such a strong feeling I had to leave the party. After that I stayed cigarette free for 4 months. I had severe mood swings, suicidal ideations, and auditory and visual hallucinations. I spoke with my psychiatrist about this many times and finally he suggested I might consider using nicotine again through vaping or pouches (he admitted this was not proper medical advice but he was kind of at a loss himself). But I held off and continued to not smoke. I tried to use patches again but they didn’t do a thing. Really at this point I didn’t even crave cigarettes I was just desperate to stop these crazy side effects of nicotine secession. 

It was April of 2025 when I was rocking my daughter to sleep one night and was having severe mood swings I had to keep inside of me (feelings of rage to sadness to laughing at amusing thoughts in the same breath). Something caught my eye and I looked up to see these blue and yellow orcs dancing with each other on my kitchen counter. Then voices started whispering to me from my walls but I couldn’t make it out what they were saying (I’ve never hallucinated outside of psychedelic drugs in my life aside from mild visual disturbances from HPPD). After I was able to put my daughter down I went to my neighbor and bummed a pack of cigs from him and started smoking again without even craving it. The craziness all stopped with the first few smokes but unfortunately I’m back to smoking 2+ packs a day. 

I can really feel it killing my lungs as I’m very active outdoors and now have some limited ability with my lung capacity and stamina. I’m desperate for a route to quit. I can deal with pain and struggle but I can’t deal with the thought of me being uncontrollably unstable in front of my daughter and wife. Thanks to everyone who took the time to read and consider!

I stopped cold turkey yesterday. I was a cigarette smoker too but stopped while I was pregnant, I only had a pack or two throughout his first six months, but safe to say I've been done with cigarettes about a year now.

Once he was born I went back to smoking weed daily and I just can't get off this train. I use it to calm my anxiety, which comes with obsessive tendencies. It calms my eating disorder and allows me to eat like a normal person. Although I do believe I will be able to regulate the ED, this stuff comes up completely RANDOM without warning sometimes. Smoking generally mellows me out, which is a state I prefer to be in as apposed to anxiety and unfortunately, sadness.

But I keep reminding myself it also makes me lazy, gives me different anxieties, feeds in to my agoraphobia and sometimes makes me OVER eat which is a gross over direction for my ED. I ALSO NEED TO NE PRESENT WITH MY TODDLER, I FEEL SO GUILTY EVERY DAY CHOOSING THIS STUPID ADDICTION OVER MY SON.

I left for an overnight shift and had to send out two apology texts to two of my biggest supporters, my fiancée and my sister because I was so rude to them all day.

Fortunately but also unfortunately, quitting the cigarettes was almost too easy for me because they started to smell/taste gross to me so I just literally barely craved them and then was able to just.. stop. I didn't pick up any coping strategies and didn't learn a thing.

Context never had sleep problems like this before, now this is my new record for staying up. If there's anything that might help me relax and not freak out that I've caused some new semi-permanent sleep disorder for myself, I'd really appreciate it.

1pqsgol,Done smoking weed and vaping nicotine. Going a little insane.,"I have been smoking weed daily for about 7 years and have been heavily addicted to nicotine for about 5 years. I tried to quit vaping nicotine using the patches/ gum but every time I felt uncomfortable I just caved and went back to the vape. When I've tried to stop weed I've felt really sick. I have never been proud of these addictions but I've never been able to stop no matter how hard I try.

In 8 days I will be traveling abroad (where weed is illegal, nicotine/ tobacco laws the same) through my university. My peers and professors are all nicotine/ drug free and know nothing of my habits. Smoking is very frowned upon in my career/major and smoke breaks aren't given. So i'm using this as my opportunity to quit. 

The past 3 days I've waited to smoke weed until the evening and I've honestly done okay. A bit worried how I'll manage fully without it starting tomorrow.... But more concerned about nicotine. Just a couple hours without it and i turn into an evil crazy person. And that is NOT a good look in front of  peers. And because I know that patches and nic gum just aren't enough to hide my crazy.... Im opting for zyns as a form of harm reduction and hopefully a stepping stone to quitting fully (ik thats controversial)... Today is my first day with 3mg zyns and no vape and honestly I don't crave vaping at all when I have one in. But the moment I spit it out i go crazy. And that's going to be a problem because on this trip I won't have the opportunity to pop one every hour. I'm sharing a room with peers and from 8am to like 3pm for like two weeks I will be in the ocean unable to have a zyn under my lip due to my snorkel. So I think regardless of the switch to zyns it's going to be rough. 

If anyone has ANY sort of advice or recommendations as to how I can manage this better, it would be super super appreciated. This is a once in a lifetime trip where I am getting the opportunity to see some of the most beautiful things our planet has to offer. I love my major and my career. I've been dreaming of the chance to do work like this since I was a child. But I'm so scared the whole experience will be ruined from my withdrawals. The end goal obviously is to fully be off everything. But right now my priority is just doing whatever possible to maintain sanity without looking unprofessional in front of respected peers or going back to vaping. 

Thank you and happy holidays to all who are celebrating! ",1766168808.0,6,8,stopsmoking,substance
1pqpewj,"Had a lung collapse from vaping 2 weeks ago, haven’t touched nicotine since.","I'm 24 and honestly never thought this would actually happen to me. I always heard vapes were safer than cigarettes so I didn't think it was a big deal... you think because you're young and haven't been doing it ""that long"" (vaping for about 3 and a half years) that you're safe from any real or long term consequences.  
  
So two weeks ago I woke up with this sharp pain in my chest, couldn't breathe right and every breath hurt like hell, my heart was pounding, and I started panicking because I knew something was wrong. Went to the ER and they told me my lung collapsed from vaping. Had to stay in the hospital for 4 days with a chest tube in and it freaked me out more than anything ever has.  
Doctors said if I kept vaping it could happen again and be even worse. That was it for me. Threw out all my vapes that same day.  
  
It's been 2 weeks now and ngl the cravings have been pretty rough some days since I went cold turkey, but every time I think about vaping I just remember that pain and how scared I was in the hospital. Been using sunflower sober to track my days and sharing my thoughts with other people going through similar stuff, it's actually helped a lot.  
Just wanted to share this because this stuff is REAL and can happen to anyone. You're not invincible. If you've been thinking about quitting, this is your sign to do it before something like this happens to you.

but in india the bigger problem is environment

chai breaks = cigarette

friends offer without asking

shops literally everywhere

what actually helped me wasn’t going cold turkey

it was switching to nicotine pouches

no stepping out

no smell on clothes

no explaining to people

the moment smoking stopped being a ritual, usage dropped on its own

felt less like “quitting” and more like opting out

still early, but this feels way more realistic than fighting social cues all day

1pqic7f,Opinion On Cigarettes Causing Anxiety/Uneasiness,"Hi everyone,as the title says,I'd like to discuss something about the anxiety/uneasiness I see a lot of people reporting about nicotine(especially cigarette smokers).I scoured multiple reddit posts about people explaining how they get anxiety/panic attacks/tense feeling after smoking cigarettes,especially the first of the day & I myself have experienced this strange phenomenon.It doesn't make sense that we used to smoke and feel relaxed but all of a sudden,we start getting panicky after lighting one without no obvious reasons.I asked chatgpt about it,and I have been told that in several countries,cigarette packs have been changed to plainly packaged ones and cigarettes themselves have been altered chemically in a supposedly ""good way"",i.e ""lower nicotine content,reduced ignition propensity,lower tar content"",but chatgpt also says:

""Cigarettes do contain more than just tobacco and nicotine. Over the years, cigarette manufacturers have made changes to the blends of tobacco, the chemicals used in processing, and the additives. Some of these additives could potentially have psychoactive effects on the body. It’s possible that newer additives, chemicals, or even the process of producing cigarettes could be triggering more pronounced anxiety responses in people who might not have experienced that before.

For example: Some brands might add chemicals to make cigarettes burn more evenly or to enhance flavor, and those chemicals could interact with your body in ways that are more anxiety-inducing. But the truth is, cigarette manufacturers don’t always disclose exactly what goes into the mix.""

So,I am thinking this might be why many smokers have reported bizarre symptoms after lighting a cig.

1pq6u2o,Sudden stop,"M26, smoked since 14. I am writing this post not to brag about it, but to see if there are people who experienced a similar situation. As I already specified, I used to smoke since I was 14. I had some years when I smoked less than a pack/day, some years with 2 packs/day. So let's say an average of 1 pack/day for 11 years. Until I simply stopped. I woke up one morning, made myself a coffee, light a cig as usual and it just felt terrible. I couldn't finish it (normally smoked at least 2 while drinking coffee). Later that day, light up another one, still same disgust. It was the same brand of cigs I used to smoke for a long time, so there was no change, same routine, same coffee. For the next couple of days same story: once I took a few puffs I couldn't handle the taste, the smell, the sensation on my throat. I went to the doc, I thought I am sick or something but everything came back as normal. I must mention that I never intended to stop - at least not at that point in life. That happened at the beginning of Oct, that also being the last time I smoked cigs. The only way of handling tobacco was if I'd smoke joints (which I eventually quit again, but voluntarily). Does anyone experienced something similar? Is there an explanation? Was it a divine intervention? 🤣 I SWEAR that I am not lying with anything, I had this curiosity since some time ago, especially because some people in my life noticed I stopped smoking and asked me how I did it - and when I'd tell them the story I feel like they are not really convinced that this is how I quit (if this wouldn't happen to me, I'd had the same doubts).

I am under no illusion of enjoying smoking. It doesn’t help me relieve anxiety and all those reasons people smoke.

I will not smoke for the rest of the day now and will be totally fine, will also be tomorrow, but I am scared of once again finding myself in a situation where my brain completely shuts and I have no reasons to not smoke one.

2. Teeth whitening strips helped me a lot. Seeing my teeth get whiter made me way more aware of not wanting to mess them up again. Sounds small but it was motivating.
3. Use Zyns strategically. I used them to transition stepped down to 3mg and then quit completely. Having a plan made it feel manageable.

NOPE stands for Not One Puff Ever. And it has to be a mantra forever, not only for the first part of the battle, because it's when our confidence is high that we are vulnerable to make mistakes. 

I'll keep updating my success.

I quit vaping 50mg disposables after about 6 years. 2 months 1 week clean as of now.

Now for about 1.5 months I have had almost daily headaches, Brian fog, ""Sinus"" Pressure in my face and temples, dizziness, depersonalization, and anxiety + panic attacks.

1pnz489,39 Days Smoke Free. Would like to share my few cents.,"30M, smoked since age 14. For most of my adult life, I was a pack-a-day smoker. In the past year, I switched to half a pack plus vaping, then went back to only cigarettes for about 1 and 2 weeks before finally quitting.

Here are some tips that worked for me:

1. **Read Allen Carr’s book with an open mind**, even if you don’t plan to quit yet. I (spontaneously) decided to quit after Chapter 3.
2. There’s an **audiobook version on Spotify**. You can listen while doing other things if reading isn’t your thing.
3. **Quitting is likely easier than you think**. I had misconceptions about it being difficult due to my ""stressful lifestyle"", but the book helped clear those up. Related to (1.), I was curious because the book made it sound so ""easy"" - part of me wants to believe and hence decided to test how ""easy"" it was.
   * Another inspiration for me was learning (recently) that a friend who was much heavier than me managed to quit overnight
4. **Know yourself.** I have a ""go big or go home"" mindset, so I took my first quit attempt very seriously. If I failed, I knew it would be a long time before I tried again.
5. **Time your last cigarette.** Mine was after lunch. Since my favourite smoke was the first one in the morning (it ""motivated"" me to start the day), quitting in the afternoon meant I would already be 20 hours smoke-free by the next morning. That made me feel invested in skipping my “hardest” time-of-the-day cigarette. (e.g. some timing helped to make it easier for me to say no to the most tempting cigarette)
6. **Understand your cravings.** I noticed I salivate when I crave a smoke, so I eat something instead.
7. **Use the ""Smoke Free"" app (or similar) to track benefits as they happen.** If you have a fitness watch, you can watch your resting heart rate drop within days. Seeing tangible progress is great motivation.
8. **Nicotine's half-life is 2-3 hours.** The first few hours were the hardest for me, I felt more irritable than usual. But it got easier after that initial hump. (in context of physical withdrawal at least)
9. **Nicotine is not the only way to get the ""good feeling"" / ""your fix"".** For example, eating and exercising also releases dopamine. ",1765882695.0,33,4,stopsmoking,substance

In these 2 years i made a lot of progress and went from 15+ cigs in a day to less than 5. It’s normal now to smoke 1 or not at all in a day. 

The thing is that this (smoke a little) habit keeps me there, and whenever Im gonna do something out of my routine (go for drinks, holidays, spend a chill day) im gonna smoke a whole pack. And if these goes for a few days, then reducing it feels like doing all the effort all over again.

 

There’s something inside of me that says, “you shouldn’t stop now” “Few cigarettes in a day is nothing” “is not that bad” “you like it”.

Even though most of my friends were into cigarettes, weed, crystals, and drinking, I always stayed away. My immediate family is completely against drugs, so that mindset was naturally passed on to me.

Over time, though, that choice became a joke. Friends would mock me, saying I was “too good,” that I hadn’t really “lived,” and that life is no fun without smoking or drinking. I honestly didn’t care for a long time.

But when I was 22, I went on a trip with my cousins. The same comments started again “you’re not enjoying life,” “you’re missing out,” “people won’t find you interesting.” Eventually, I broke. I smoked for the first time.

I didn’t even feel anything.

I’m 24 now, and in total I’ve probably smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes, mostly in social situations when friends or cousins were smoking. I never really knew how to smoke properly, and they could always tell which led to more mocking.

At some point, I realized this wasn’t me. It was an alter ego I created just to look tough or fit in. And the truth I’ve come to accept is that I don’t need to smoke or drink to prove anything. I’ve also realized that a lot of people turn to substances because they’re insecure or trying to escape something and that just isn’t who I am.

I haven’t smoked in almost a year now, but I still regret ever starting. Not because I became addicted, but because I compromised my values just to please others.

1pnq119,The Nicotine Patches are not near as good today as they were in 2008.,"I quit smoking back in 2008, and I used the patch. Back then, the patch stuck really good, so good it was hard to remove without a small amount of pain, almost. And so it was easy for me to re-use my patches, since I took them off before bed, I'd put them back on the backing and put it on the next day. I was successful, and refrained from smoking until just recently, because I was silly and decided to smoke again.

Fast forward to 2025; now the patch barely stays on if you move much or rub it in any way, etc. And re-using it seems to be impossible, because they barely stick at all the 2nd time.

  
I prefer the skin colored patches because they were better for me when it came to reusing the patches, compared to the clear patch, which was also more expensive. I don't care about the appearance of the patch, since it's always under my shirt anyway.

  
Well, it's working to stop my cravings though. The first few days i still had cravings and smoked a little bit, but now I am on day 4 and no messing around. Plus the craving has reduced.

1. It’s hard to quit cold turkey. Pick a date and try to reduce over a span of week. 

2. Don’t rely on just willpower alone, use science-based tools.

3. Don’t beat yourself if you relapse. 95% people who tries to quit fails, it’s hard but it works out if you don’t give up. 

4. Don’t run away from facts. Smoking kills more Americans than alcohol, car accidents, drugs, AIDS, suicide, and murder COMBINED. Over 480,000 deaths yearly. If that doesn’t want you to quit, what will. 

5. When cravings hit, use the craving surf method. Basically meditate or do anything that helps you resist the craving for 2-3 mins, almost all the cravings fade in 2-3 mins.

For the last 3–4 years, it’s been at least a pack a day.

I’ve tried quitting more times than I can count. Nicotine gum, patches, vapes, tapering, cold turkey. None of it stuck. I failed every time. But I’m trying again.

Not because I suddenly feel strong or disciplined, but because I still believe I can win someday. Even if I’ve failed a lot, I don’t want to stop trying. Quitting once and failing doesn’t mean quitting forever.

I am terrified of the dentist. Went to the dentist for toothache early last month, found out I needed several teeth pulled. A nightmare coming true. The procedure would include bone grafting and a lot of $$$ if I want a chance for an implant to be successful. And no more nicotine/cigarettes or the whole thing could fail. 

Honestly I was more afraid of not being allowed a cigarette when I wanted one than I was of having the procedure done. But I was also even more afraid of getting dry socket from trying to smoke while my extractions were healing. I read and heeded all of the warnings about how painful dry socket is and scared myself straight with other people's help. 

I also started reading Allen Carr's The Easy Way to Stop Smoking. ( I downloaded the ebook.) A friend told my husband and I about the book years ago, and as they say, I wish I'd read it sooner. I really do want to quit, which is essential to quitting believe it or not, and the book helped me fight the voice in my head that defended my love for smoking cigarettes. It definitely helped me stand strong against smoking when I was most at risk for dry socket. 

I know how stupid it is to smoke and to want to smoke cigarettes, but when we're addicted to something, we find ways to keep it in our lives. Easy Way makes it easier to see why we don't want nicotine in our lives, what the trade offs are, and why it can be easy to quit when it is truly our own desire to be a non-smoker. 

I smoked my last cigarette on queue while reading the book, the night before my dental surgery. And yes, it's sucked, and yes I have had to go through a lot of other BS to get to day 12 of no cigs, but here I am.

So what if I've cried and cussed a lot (to myself and to the inner monsters still bothering me for a 'taste'). I'm enjoying my new love for orange Jello and flossing in lieu of lighting up a cigarette. 

Husband is trying to catch up to me and quit smoking too. I'm being 'nice' and not telling him how bad it smells to me now. He washes up and is discreet. He said it's been pretty awesome seeing me quit, and we both know I was the most loyal smoker, so hopefully he will get through the cravings and discomfort sooner than me.

1pmoju5,I’m 27 years old and I’ve been smoking for about 10 years.,"
During those 10 years, I quit several times. The longest was one full month. I quit cold turkey, and honestly… that month was incredible. I was genuinely happy. I didn’t crave cigarettes at all. I still don’t understand how I reached that mindset. It felt effortless. One of the best months of my life.

Then I started smoking again because I thought my girlfriend was cheating on me. That emotional shock pushed me right back.

Now I’m trying to quit again, but the first day is unbearable. I somehow make it through the day, but at night the urge becomes so strong that I end up smoking one cigarette. Just one. And then I feel like I’ve failed again.

I really want to quit, but I feel stuck — like I’m trapped in quicksand.

What confuses me the most is this:
What kind of motivation or mental state did I have during that one month when quitting felt so easy and even joyful?

That was only 3–4 months ago. I’ve tried many methods since then, but nothing sticks.

This is a very important issue for me. Honestly, I feel like most of the things I failed at in life are somehow connected to smoking. That’s how deep this addiction feels to me.

Has anyone been in a similar situation?
Is there any unusual or non-obvious tactic that actually helped you break this cycle?

I’d really appreciate hearing your experiences.

1pm8iqx,Confession time,"I was born 15 years post WW2, both my parents smoked my entire youth. In the car, at home, there was no thought on second hand smoke so myself and siblings were constantly exposed. TV shows like Beverly Hillbillies, Perry Mason,  they all promoted smoking and Winston's was a major sponsor of those shows. At 17 I got my first real job and I worked in a smallish office were 3 employees all smoked, I was the only non smoker or so I thought.  Usually the office was filled with blue haze of second hand smoke, my clothes smelled, my throat often burned but I never gave it a thought, other than it was gross and I hated looking at full ashtrays. In the mid 80s smoking rooms were setup and office staff had to go there to smoke. The air in the office was now free of smoke and I was still a non smoker.

  
My girlfriends' parents were also smokers but my girlfriend didn't smoke but she had tried it. One day in June, 1984 she talked me into buying a pack of cigarettes, telling me I'd enjoy it. Stupidist mistake I ever made as exposure to second hand smoke had caused me to become addicted and I never knew it, until it was too late. A pack a week at first, telling myself I could quit anytime. I enjoyed it, it satisfied the need that was created by 20 ish years of second hand smoke. I was young, in love and seduced by a craving I never realised I had.

Eventually my girlfriend became my wife and smoking was now a part of my life. I tried many times to quit but could never break the cycle. In 2018 cannibus was legalised in Canada. I tried it and found mixing it with tobacco gave me a better rush and what started as friday night fun quickly moved to weekends and then weeknights. It relaxed me, helped me sleep, I liked the feeling it offered.

  
About 6 weeks ago, I don't know what happened but cannibus lost all appeal to me. I didn't consciously decide to stop, i just stopped, no desire, no need to go outside, no nothing, just stopped all cannibus. I've got several prerolls in a container in my sock drawer and there they sit. I only remember them occasionally and there is absolutely no draw to consume them. I keep them as a safety net, knowing I have them in case I ever need them again. However, I know I'm done with them. 2 weeks later I'm in the garage smoking a cigarette as usual, I head off to bed shortly after. The next morning, a Saturday, I made a coffee, took the pack of cigarettes and saw 4 remaining. I looked at them and had zero desire to light up. That pack with 4 remaining is still in the drawer, next to the cannibus and there they sit, undesired, not temping me and there they will continue to sit.

I do not understand what happened. One day I'm consuming cannibus and cigarettes, pack a day user. Then a switch was thrown and something changed, no desire to smoke, no cravings, no headaches, just shitty sleep for the first few weeks. One of my worst vices was watching youtube videos while smoking and drinking coffee. It wouldn't be unusual to smoke 4 or 5 cigarettes over the course of a couple hours. I still watch youtube videos and drink coffee but smoking is done and I don't miss it at all.

I've tried several times to quit and every time I've failed. This time I wasn't even trying, it just happened and I've never been more content with myself. I think I've slayed something because I know I will never smoke again, ever. My mind is clear, I understand that if a craving should come I can handle it but more importantly I know how it feels to smoke versus not smoke and I choose not smoking. Perhaps it was just time to quit, I now think of smoking as a boring waste of time that never did me one favour. It's been over a month and I have been keeping my not smoking secret from my wife and family. No one knows I've done this and I don't plan to make a big deal of it. One day I suppose I'll share but in the meantime I'm going to enjoy my secret and count the thousands of saved dollars. I never thought I'd quit like this, I never thought I could quit.

1pm5wvo,100 Days Smoke-Free After 30 Years.,"Today marks 100 days without a cigarette.

It’s a milestone I honestly never believed I would reach. I’ve been smoking for over 30 years. Long enough that it stopped being a habit and became part of who I thought I was. When I was younger, I told myself I’d quit at 40. I’m 47 now. That alone says something about how powerful this addiction really is. 

What I don’t think people talk about enough is just how deep nicotine gets into your mind. You see TV commercials that say “Call this number and quit,” but compared to how we treat other addictions, with rehab centers, support systems and structured recovery, smoking often gets framed as something you should just decide to stop. As if willpower alone is enough. But nicotine rewires your brain. It doesn’t let go easily. A hundred days in, the physical withdrawals have mostly faded, but the psychological ones still hit hard. I’ve had to relearn how to exist without a cigarette in my hand. What to do when I’m angry. Or bored. Or lonely. How to celebrate good news. How to cope after a couple drinks. Even how to see myself.

My entire adult life, I was “a smoker.” Whether it was cigarettes or weed, that identity was always there. Now I’m someone who doesn’t smoke and I’m still figuring out who that person is. I’m learning about him day by day. The only thing I know for sure is that he can’t go back. The cravings still whisper. There’s always that voice waiting to pounce when I’m stressed or anxious, promising that one cigarette would help. But I know better. Smoking never fixed anything. The only relief it gave me was relief from the withdrawal it created. Without it, I breathe better. I smell better. I taste better. My anxiety is lower. My life is better.

Nicotine didn’t give me anything. It took things away. It took my dopamine balance, my confidence, my health and my time. So whether  it’s 100 days or 1,000, the motto stays the same:

I might have a cigarette someday… but not today.

And for now, today is enough.",1765688904.0,59,12,stopsmoking,substance

I was a heavy vaper, going through a 50mg disposable 10,000 hitter in 4 to 5 days so morning to night, after a break up I fell into really bad anxiety where I would spend a big part of my day in fight or flight state and intrusive thoughts that were non stop, I decided to quit vaping as I thought this might be the cause, the first couple weeks were rough but I got through it using patches for the first month, I did 4 and a half weeks of patches and have been off the patches for 6 weeks now, I do feel calmer as I am not stuck in the fight or flight state like I was so I know its helped but the anxiety comes on randomly now and it's intense when it hits, the main problem is the depression, I am struggling to get through each day and I have never felt a lowness like this feeling, I have read it takes 3 months for my dopamine to return to normal levels but has anyone gone through this and will the 3 month + level make a big differents because life is tough right now.​",1765687523.0,3,3,stopsmoking,substance

1plghqp,Panic attacks and mood changes a month into quitting,"As the title says I have had horrible panic attacks and fluctuating mood 33 days into quitting now. For the first week I had horrendous pins and needles and shooting pains all across my body but those have since subsided. For about 3 weeks I had strong brain fog but that seems to have gone away as well. I am currently dealing with anxiety and panic attacks that occur at random throughout the day with seemingly no cause at all (besides at night). There’s also some weird dizziness that comes and goes, but I can’t really say if it’s dizziness because nothing around me is actually spinning, I just feel very off balance when walking. The worst part of this is the anxiety, as I’m literally googling every little sensation I get in my body. For example heart palpitations which many people have said on here were pretty normal after quitting.

I’ve gone to the doctor, gotten blood tests, been to the ER twice (due to the panic attacks, felt like I was dying) and everything has been completely normal. I’m now starting to think my anxiety has severely played up all my symptoms. 

I’m not asking for medical advice but I’m just wondering has anybody gone through something like this, or currently is going through it? I’ve been able to function somewhat normally but at night whenever I try to sleep the intrusive thoughts always contribute to me having a panic attack, affecting my sleep and sometimes causing me to miss class in the morning.

I have managed not to buy any more cigarettes since October last year! 

I am still vaping, and I know that's not a popular thing on this sub and it genuinely could be the wrong choice for many. I am lucky enough that for me, I have genuinely severly cut down on my spending and nicotine consumption since making the switch. By my calculations I've saved around USD 200; not the biggest deal but it's a fun thing to keep track off that helps me maintain my resolve.

*Things that help:*

-- I've stuck to my rule of not vaping where I wouldn't smoke, so I vape like 5-15 times a day in the outdoors

-- I don't feel compelled to finish a stick so sometimes I stop at just a few puffs

-- I use a low nicotine concentration

-- I've gotten into coffee so in the morning instead of being desperate for my first smoke, I make espresso instead. Ngl there are bad days when I seem to vape nonstop, but I would honestly say that there are much more days when I don't need to vape until after lunch



*Things that don't help:*

-- When I join friends on smoking breaks and someone has the exact brand and kind of cigarette that used to be my favorite, I fold... I have smoked exactly nine sticks since Quitting Day on Oct 2024

-- I can't break the habit of needing to smoke after meals 😅 I usually skip breakfast or else am running late, but deadass how will I ever quit vaping if immediately after eating a meal, my instinct is to go out and puff in peace

-- My partner both vapes and smokes, though leaning more towards cigarettes still sadly

1pkntrv,Please try Tabex if you are struggling,"Short context: smoker of 10 years on and off, with a two year smoke-free period a few years back. Now a smoker for two years. Could no longer quit using will-power.

I bought Tabex a few days ago and it's literally a miracle. It's a herbal smoking cessation aid that's sold over the counter here in Eastern Europe, that's based on Cytisine, a compound that's from the same family as Nicotine, found in various plants.

Unlike Nicotine, it actually does nothing to the human body, but it actually blocks Nicotine receptor, doing two things:

1. stops nicotine from binding to nicotine receptors, making you UNABLE to receive any pleasure/effect from nicotine whatsoever;
2. tricks the brain into thinking you have a nicotine molecule attached to the receptor, minimizing withdrawal symptoms.

The pills come with an instruction manual: basically, you're supposed to keep smoking for five days while taking them, then stop around day 5. You take 6 tablets a day every two hours, then on day 3 you cut down to five tables every 2,5 hours, and the amount taken decreases for the entire month's course.

However, I stopped smoking on Day 3 because the effect of those tablets is that you are literally no longer able to get any ""relief"" from smoking whatsoever. You still feel a somewhat slight pang here and there, but actually smoking the cigarette does absolutely nothing, like sucking on hot smoke - that's the best description I have of the sensation. Technically, since Tabex made Nicotine unable to bind to the nicotine receptors, I was already technically on withdrawal for those three days so I stopped on Day 3 thinking - what the hell - what's the point of continuing to smoke at this point.

For the first time in a long while, I literally no longer feel like smoking. At all.  
Look up feedback on Tabex on Reddit if you don't want to take my word for it.

It has least side effects of all available smoking cessation aids and for that reason does not require a prescription.  ",1765532186.0,14,17,stopsmoking,substance

I went to Costco with my partner, which is already a difficult ask because something about the flooring always makes my hip act up. Even before I quit, this was something I struggled with. And December is horrible; it gets so suffocatingly crowded. I was feeling actively anxious. 

My partner decided, after we'd left the parking lot and we were taking the normal route home, to tell-- not ask-- me to find a better route for traffic. I don't drive. I could figure out the bus route from there. I don't know what they wanted. They just started yelling.

I started bawling my fucking eyes out and genuinely considered getting out of the vehicle and asking a bystander for a cigarette. 

I had a nicotine gum when I got home, and I just sat in the washroom with the door locked and cried. And then I spent six hours cooking a really nice dinner. I don't expect my partner to be perfect and take anger or abuse or anything like that, but I have the time off work and I'm trying to better myself and I want more empathy than I'm receiving.

1pkar45,I Quit Nicotine After 10 Years,"I’ve quit nicotine before - few times.    
Months at a time.    
Always relapsed.  

This time was different. Not because the withdrawal was easier. Not because life was lighter. Actually, life was *harder* than ever.

The difference was this:

>I finally stopped lying to myself about what nicotine really is.

Let me explain, because this realization flipped everything.

# 1. The biggest lie about smoking: “psychological vs physiological addiction

People love this distinction

>Oh, the physical part is nothing, the psychological addiction is the real battle

I completely disagree.

Here’s the truth:  

**Smokers invent psychological reasons to justify the physiological addiction**.

We tell ourselves:

* “It’s the ritual.”
* “I just like holding something.”
* “It relaxes me.”
* “It helps me think.”
* “It helps with stress.”
* “It’s part of my personality.”
* ...and 100 other reasons.

But if it were *really* the ritual, people would switch to nicotine-free vapes or plastic straws.

Almost nobody does.    
Because it’s not the ritual.    
It’s not the break.    
It’s not the moment.  

**It’s the nicotine. The chemical. The micro-high.**

Once you see this, it becomes obvious that almost everything we call “psychological addiction” is actually just your brain waiting for the next dopamine spike.

# 2. I realized I wasn’t using nicotine to feel less pain… I was using it to get HIGH

Not a dramatic high.    
Not a life-changing euphoric high.  

A **5-second mini-high.**

That tiny boost after inhaling.    
That split-second dopamine pop.    
That little “mmm” feeling.

That’s what the addiction really is.

Not coping.    
Not managing anxiety.    
Not inspiration.    
Not productivity.

**Just chasing a chemical hit. Over and over. Thousands of times per year**

Once I saw this, something inside me snapped:  

**I don’t negotiate with addiction. I’m not that person**.

And suddenly quitting wasn’t a negotiation anymore - it was a rejection of an identity I never wanted.

# 3. The world romanticizes smoking - and it blinded me for years

Movies, music videos, culture…  

They make smoking look:

* deep
* artistic
* tortured
* rebellious
* cool

But it’s none of that.  

It’s a **high-frequency dopamine addiction** that manipulates your emotions and routines until you think it’s part of your personality.

The moment you see through that illusion, the craving dies.

# 4. The Reflexes: The Last Echoes of a Dying Circuit

In the first days and weeks after quitting, I noticed reflexes:

* after food
* after coffee
* after finishing a task
* when tense
* when annoyed
* when sad
* when happy

But these were not cravings.

They were:

* neural habits
* memory circuits
* old loops firing without meaning
* the “addiction brain” echoing into empty space

And every time one appeared, I could see it clearly:

>“Oh, you want the mini-high.  Too bad - that function is gone.”

I wasn’t fighting cravings.  

I was watching a broken system shut down.

And day by day, the noise faded.

# 5. Final truth: I didn’t quit because I became stronger.

I quit because I finally saw nicotine for what it really is.

* Not a friend.  
* Not a relief.  
* Not a comfort.  
* Not a ritual.  
* Not a tool.

Just:

**mini-high → withdrawal → mini-high → withdrawal → repeat**    
**…for 10 years.**

Once you see the cycle naked without romanticism, without excuses, it loses all power.

And that’s when quitting becomes inevitable.

**If you’re trying to quit: stop asking how to live without smoking**

Instead ask: Do I want to live as an addict?

Because once your answer becomes **“No,”** everything else falls into place.

1pjwy7i,My Experience of Finally Quitting Nicotine for good,"Just wanted to make a brief post about my experience, in the hopes it may help someone.

-32 year old male
-startet at around 15, gradually increased nicotine intake over about 2-3 years, then (at least) one pack a day fo 14 years.

About 4 years ago, I startet to feel like my immune system and nervous system were getting out of balance. Almost always felt on edge mentally and physically. Weird chest pains or stinging in the lungs rounded off the experience.

This came and went constantly, but the nicotine addict in me did not want to see clearly and confront the fact that I would be better off quitting smoking. Smoking was my comfort, my one true safe pleasure, at least so I thought.

I really could not imagine a life entirely  without smoking, at least on certain occasions.

It changed when I realized two things:

1. My body is not producing more dopamine as a smoker compared to if I was a non smoker. Meaning: The dopamine a smoker  gets from smoking is missing in other situations in daily life, which is why I didn't enjoy things like reading or meals as much as I do now. So smoking=happier is an illusion. The joy  comes from releaving the withdrawl. Thats it.

2: Nicotine is a stimmulant (Sherlock, I know).
Off course my body and mind were often/always on edge. Off course I had weird cortisol spikes in the evening or too early in the mornings, no matter how much I delt with other stressors in my life. Off course I felt like I was always in need of rest and repair, because my body was constantly busy repairing itsself from smoking.

When I realized this, and internalized it, it hit me hard. 

So how did I quit?

1. Internalized the above.
2. Promised my self to continue trying to stop, even if it takes multiple tries.
3. Whenever a craving came (they were bad) I would say to my self ""stay the f**k away from me, I don't want this anymore"". Or ""You might as well stop screaming for nicotine, I'm not giving you any anyway"".

The first 72 hours were hard, but because I genuinely did not want this sh*t anymore I pushed through. Did lots of walking and just sitting with my thoughts. Sleep was bad and not long enough. 

Then it got a little better day by day. I noticed that even during the peak withdrawl, not having that nicotine fueled nervous system adrenaline up and down roller coaster was a novel and welcome experience.

After day 6 the cravings where mild at best and I was surprised how good it felt to not be a slave to nicotine. It was like realizing you idolized your toxic ex and now youre questioning your sanity for previously being so obsessed with the idea of being with them.

From there the idea off smoking cigarettes just faded away more and more over time.


Quitting smoking and beating nicotine addiction won't solve all your problems, but you will have a big stone less to carry.

Cheers and much love guys.

I’ve been a heavy vaper for about 3 years, 20 ML pods every 2-3 days. I’ve been a serious runner most of my life and I’m starting to notice it catch up on me, shocked it took this long. 

I decided quitting would be my New Years resolution. Part of me knew that was nonsense, if you’re not willing to start right away you’re just making an excuse and you’ll make another one for New Years. 

My partner and I started watching this Netflix series called Ripple. Very quickly into the series a character is diagnosed with lung cancer, he has a little girl, I have 2 little girls. 

I got up, filled a glass of water, tossed my vape in it. Kinda hurt, just spent $38 on the new pod lol. No point in waiting for New Years.

    It feels like stupid hokey self help BS that I would always sneer at but the fact is: it worked for me. Im done with nicotine. I know that I will never do it again. I dont consider myself very respectful of authority and have never read any sort of self help anything without Rolling my eyes and arguing in my head. At the very least thinking ""well thats obvious"" or ""its not that simple"". But this book its all true, its all obvious, its all that simple, and I needed to hear it. 

    It just makes sense. Its not actually hard to stop and the only way to stop is to never do it again. I stopped using nicotine in the first quarter of the book. (The book says not to but I was too disgusted by the idea of prolonging my addiction I couldnt continue until I finished the book) 

      It made me realize.Why should I be scared of withdrawal? I am a strong person and have never minded a little pain, but I was using my fear as an excuse. I would get another illness or an injury and keep it pushing, but I was worried about nicotine withdrawals? I can't believe I continued for so long, and I worried so much over something that cant seriously harm me or anyone else. 

 I think maybe my issue was that I was trying hard not to think about my addiction and that stopped me from looking at it clearly. And reading a whole book listing out all the excuses I was giving myself and why they don't make any sense worked wonders.

 I think the whole book made me realize I was being a little dramatic about the whole thing, and that It doesnt have to be this arduous process of quitting, I can just stop, and that's that. Mission accomplished.

I quit over a month ago. Just straight-up quit, I was told to not smoke before a surgery so I didn't. Then I spent almost a month in the hospital with various complications(yay meningitis) so smoking wasn't really my top priority and I sort of... forgot about it, I guess.

Well now I've been back from the hospital for close to two weeks and the past few days have been absolutely awful. I'm constantly short of breath. Sudden coughing fits, my throat feels so scratchy in general. My anxiety is through the roof and I'm pacing and can't concentrate. I'm constantly hungry and craving food but actually eating makes me nauseous and I want to throw up. I've also gained about 2kg since I quit and I'm afraid it'll only get worse. 

Now, there were some... irritants, earlier today, that amplified all this and made me even angrier and more anxious and depressed, which didn't help things at all. And I'm still in pain from the surgery and subsequent complications. And as a further insult I tried signing up for a smoking cessation group thing at my clinic and they called me today to cancel, two days before it was supposed to begin.

I thought after 30+ days the physical sensations should be gone but I still feel like my body is about to fall apart. I'm irritatble and anxious all day. The idea of living like this every day from now on seems like torture. All I do all day is wait until it gets late enough so I can take my sleep aids and finally get some respite from feeling like this.

I don't know what to do. I'm on ADHD meds(Concerta 36mg) and I've asked my GP for benzodiazepines(Lorazepam 1mg) a few days ago when my anxiety was really skyrocketing, but neither of them seem to help. If anything restarting the Concerta after not taking it for a while post-surgery seemed to make it worse, although it did reduce my binge eating.

This sucks. Help. I just want to cry all day(which I do, so, err, yeah). I don't know if I can keep going at this rate. ",1765282955.0,9,9,stopsmoking,substance

Vaping Habit: 3 years, daily (gave up cold turkey August 24^(th) 2025)

Current medications: Olmesartan Medoxomil (20mg), low dose asprin 

**Deciding to Give Up Vaping for Good**

On August 24^(th) 2025 I called the ambulance on myself after feeling intense heart racing effect. It was like I could feel my heartbeat in my head and this made me terribly anxious. When the ambulance arrived I had elevated blood pressure reading of 180/110. I was in emergency observation for a few hours and then discharged later. At this time I quit vaping for good, cold turkey.

**September 2025 (1 Month Nicotine-free)**

In September 2025, I saw a cardiologist who diagnosed me with hypertension after investigating potential secondary causes with a thorough review of my bloods, urine, CT scan, angiogram, EEG and ECG. I was given the clear but my Lipoprotein-a was quite a lot higher than the average and was a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Apparently, it is under-tested in most blood panel tests. The doctor prescribed me asprin, Olmesartan as well as a cholesterol pill which I didn’t end up taking.

 **October 2025 (2 Months Nicotine-free)**

In October, I started to have this strange pins and needles effect running up and down my arms (vessel repair, nerve damage?). I also had some mild chest discomfort, sometimes it was this fleeting stabbing pain that would last for a second or two and then immediately go away. My Blood pressure was still elevated, by the end of the month the heart racing effect was becoming less prevalent or noticeable. I was still aware almost of my heartbeat and avoided physical exertion to the point in my me insecure about own body! The good news I had no urge to vape anymore at this point.

**November/December 2025 (>3 months Nicotine-free)**

I noticed some definite improvement not just in body but in mind. In November, the tingling sensation in my arms had reduced significantly. Heart racing effect continued to become less of a problem to the point I felt a bit more body confident. The ocassionaly have some chest discomfort, sometimes a bit of strange shooting pain but I have also been burping A LOT these past few weeks. Sometimes hundreds of burps per day. I have absolutely no idea why this is and if anyone has any potential reasons why, let me know. 

**Learnings & Looking Forward**

I realise the MASSIVE impact vaping has on health and wellbeing. Taking away vaping forced my body to feel the damage I had done. After years of daily abuse, I cannot expect fast recovery. It will take more time still and I have noticed some improvements. A big part of this journey is mental too, there is a powerful mind-body connection that happens. Sometimes mind affects the body and vice versa.  Part of this included accepting that when things feel wrong in the body it can also be a sign the body trying to repair itself not necessarily that something is wrong.",1765271712.0,14,3,stopsmoking,substance

I'm 21, been smoking around 30 a day since 16, plus some 50mg nicopods, like ten a day.
I quit with cytisine 40 days ago, threw away the cytisine 20 days ago.
Not smoking is not difficult to me, I go to a pub once a week where people around me smoke and I don't mind. Sure, I have the taste for it, but it's disgusting now, and wanting it is even more disgusting.
I'm firm on my stance that smoking is not worth it, I don't want to have to quit again, I don't want to lose that money again, I don't want it to always be on my mind, I don't want to feel like shit again. Just not worth it, don't even want it.
I've been quitting every 14 days for the past 2 years but never lasted more than 5 days before. Then I got sick of it, started to hate myself for it and quit.
Can I hold onto this stance or should I change my behaviour/mindset in the future? I know that I'm really done with the ""just one"" thought.

1ph2uq3,Day 1 again. Don’t believe in that “occasional smoking” bullshit if you were addicted.,"I started smoking 3 years ago. First vape, then ciggs, then both like a dumbass. I was on more than a pack a day. Then I quit cold turkey back in June. Idk why but it was easy as hell. Had withdrawals for like a day or two and then boom I was done. Felt free for the first time in forever.

Then I went to a Weeknd concert 2 months later and thought one cig with some weed wouldn’t do shit to me. Next morning I bought a pack telling myself “one pack won’t do anything.” Yeah ok.

Fast forward and for the past month I’ve been waking up every night at 2 or 3 or 4 coughing my lungs out, phlegm everywhere, literally choking. And I was STILL smoking a pack a day on top of that.

Last night I threw up from coughing so hard, lost my voice, and couldn’t sleep at all because GERD plus smoking fucks you up BAD. Like actually ruins you.

So yesterday I snapped. Took my cig pack, ran it under the tap, tossed it so deep in the trash I wouldn’t even THINK about digging it out like some fiend.

Today was Day 1 and honestly it was easy as fuck all day. No cravings, nothing. Then after dinner it hit me like a truck. Not even craving nicotine, I got Zyns and a Juul sitting right here and I don’t give a fuck about them. It’s ciggs. The taste, the feel, the vibe, the whole ritual. My brain is just screaming because nicotine is gone for good.

I’m scared for the next week ngl. But at the same time I keep telling myself I don’t smoke, I’m not a smoker, and the craving drops. Just gotta get through this messy ass part and let my body heal from the damage I ignored.

I used to go through a full pack a day, and on days with football or hanging out with friends it could easily go up to a pack and a half.

Is this kind of compulsive eating still normal even six months after quitting, or does it sound like something else might be going on?

I didn’t realize how much the anxiety and stress was draining me. I feel so much more present. Not like I’m missing something or searching for something (how nicotine addiction presented for me). Physically, I wake up with more energy. 

I have had stressful moments and had a fleeting craving but something deep in my bones understands that a cigarette doesn’t fix anything. It offers a distraction (and then creates a secondary problem). I also realized that “one more” will literally never be enough. 100 is not enough for me. 1000 is not enough. That nicotine siren song tempting me to “just have one” is a lie because one would never satisfy me, and I know that now. TBH I wasn’t satisfied when I was actively smoking as much as I wanted so there’s no way I would be satisfied now. 

Once I recognized all the little tricky ways my nicotine addiction was trying to call me back in by romanticizing a cig or making it seem like a “solution” for anything, I just named the thought for what it was- a nicotine craving. The addiction will always come up with reasons to smoke. These are not real justifications, just rationalizations. That made it so much easier to let the craving thought float away.

You want to ascertain you consume *all* the micronutrients you need to have as good of a time quitting as possible. You don't want to leave anything to chance. It's an important process, and this is an important part of it. Your body needs to have everything it needs.

This is what you NEED every day - whether you get it from supplements or your diet:

1) Multivitamin (1 a day is usually the dosage, read the label, of course)

2) Fish or Fish oil caps (read the label) \[this is your omega-3s\]

3) Seeds/nuts (or seed oils), a very small portion should be enough \[this is your omega-6s\]

4) Protein (meat, dairy, legumes, also some nuts, or protein powder just t make sure)

5) Animal fat (maybe some fat in your steak, research sources, need some every day)

6) Fiber & complex carbs (may come from grains, nuts, legumes, fruits, veggies...minimize sugar and fructose).

Research the exact quantities but make sure you have all the components of a normal diet, if you can. This will help immensely with recovery and healing. You can mix and match, if you are sure about what and how much you get from what source.

1pfqh4z,Trying to quit vaping/smoking because of ED — anyone actually see improvement after quitting?,"I’m trying to quit vaping starting today, and one of my biggest motivations is fixing my erectiledysfunction.

Some background on the habits:

Started smoking weed at 15

Cigarettes at 17

Switched to vaping  in my early 20s (28 currently) Around the same time I got into abusing Adderall That’s when my erectiledysfunction first showed up — at first Adderall made me last forever, but eventually everything crashed and my eq became inconsistent or nonexistent. I’ve since quit adderall for about 5 years now.

I’ve been dealing with erectiledysfunction since around 2020–2021. It’s on-and-off, but enough that it’s affecting my confidence. I’ve seen everywhere that nicotine can mess with blood flow and erections, and honestly, with my usage history… it makes sense.

I’m quitting vaping today hoping things start to improve by Valentine’s Day. I recently started dating someone I met online. We’ve only seen each other once, and she’s not a first-night type of girl, which actually worked in my favor. The next time I see her will be on Valentine’s Day, which realistically could lead to an intense situation. I want to be honest with her when the time comes, but right now my biggest focus is quitting vaping and hopefully improving things naturally before then.

Any real advice or success stories would really help. Trying to start fresh today. I’m also planning on trying to get a script for Cialis as a backup, but I’d prefer to fix the root issue instead of relying on meds forever.

So I’m coming here because I want real experiences from people who quit: 
Did quitting vaping help your dysfunction ? How long did it take before you noticed a difference? Did your libido or sensitivity come back? Did blood flow improve in general?

1pepuqf,It is possible to quit smoking with subliminal messages,"We stare at screens for 6+ hours a day. Why not use that time to ""reprogram"" our subconscious?


Hey everyone,

When we hear ""subliminal messages,"" we usually think of those 10-hour audio tracks on YouTube with hidden whispers under rain sounds. But let's be honest: wearing headphones all day or listening to frequencies isn't always practical for everyone.

As a developer, I started researching a different approach: Visual Subliminals. I ended up building a project around this concept, and I wanted to discuss the logic behind it with you all.

Why ""Visual"" instead of Audio? (The Flash Effect)
According to research on perception, there is a difference between what our eyes see and what our conscious mind registers.

The Mechanism: When text or an image flashes on a screen for a very short duration (e.g., 30-50 milliseconds), your conscious mind (the critical filter) can't fully ""read"" it. It just perceives a flicker.

The Backdoor: However, the subconscious mind is much faster and captures that millisecond-long exposure like a snapshot.
 This bypasses the ""critical faculty"" of the brain that usually rejects affirmations (like your brain saying ""No, you're not rich"" when you say ""I am rich"").

My App ""Sublim"" & How It Works
I wanted to leverage the massive amount of time we spend on our phones. I developed an app called Sublim that works as a system overlay.

Basically, while you are scrolling through Instagram, reading Reddit, or even playing a game, the app flashes your chosen affirmations (e.g., ""Stay Focused,"" ""Confident,"" ""Quit Smoking"") on the screen for a split second.

You don't have to stop what you are doing. You continue your day, but your eyes—and your subconscious—are constantly exposed to these cues in the background.

Think of it as a ""Personal Billboard""
You don't consciously read every billboard you pass on the highway, but the imagery sticks. This tool turns your phone screen into a personal billboard that only advertises your goals to you.

I fully understand it’s an addiction and have really emphasized I’m not mad at her but she’s always denying it and finding new excuses despite the evidence. She always smells like it and covers it up with perfume, she drives around in her car for over 5 minutes 3 times a day every day to “breathe and relax”. She has psoriasis and claims that’s what the white flurries are in her car but if you touch it you get the exact reaction you get from ashes. Any suggestions on what I can do? She finally took a nicotine test and it came out positive and she is saying she’s surprised and wasn’t expecting it and has made several excuses including the fact she ate French fries earlier which contain a minuscule amount of nicotine which I feel she would only know that fact if she’s previously been looking for excuses. I loved my mom so much and I just want to have her around as long as I can and have her healthy as can be for her own sake and comfort. I work in healthcare and COPD is my biggest fear.

1pdymn8,Dealing with health anxiety (Day 17),"Hey everyone. I've quit smoking 17 days ago after 5 years of daily smoking (I'm 24m) and the health anxiety I'm experiencing is debilitating. Basically I've been dealing with some muscular issues and the onset of an anxiety disorder after a panic attack a couple of months back, which also urged me to drastically cut back on my smoking and eventually quit completely. However, I'm now stuck in a bad loop where I cannot stop attributing every little symptom I'm experincing to cancer as a result of smoking.
For example I've been experiencing fatigue/exhaustion/bad sleep/weight loss, which can most likely be attributed to the anxiety, but my mind always goes straight to leukemia/lymphoma.
Similarly, I've been experiencing throat irritation/enlarged lymphnodes/weird mouth and tongue sensations/jaw pain/ear pain/pulling in the neck/weird larynx sensations (such as tightness), which my ENT has attributed to TMJ (bruxism)/muscular issues.
Generally I've been to the doctor so many times in the last couple of weeks (4× GP, 3× ER, 1× each ENT and dentist), had osteopathy done and starting physiotherapy soon, started exercising again, had 2 blood panels done and yet - nothing was found, everyone single doctor has attributed me good health. Rationally I should know that I'm not terminally ill and that the issues I have are easily explainable, yet somehow my mind always wanders so ""its smoking-related cancer"".

1pdo2ag,Quitting 100 times,"I wanted to share my journey with smoking and how it has had a hold on me since I was a teenager. 

I turned 30 recently and I swore to myself I would not be a smoker in my 30s. Yet, for the 100th, maybe 1000th time I succumbed to my addiction after about 4/5 days. 

I have been quitting since I was 19. Telling everyone that I have quit, that’s it, no more. This is my last cigarette. 

I started when I was 14-15, I used to steal and scavenge them off my sister who was much older or find old dog ends and roll them into rizla. I was told I wasn’t supposed to smoke and it filled me with ambition to do it. Wow I regret it so. 

I even read Alan Carrs easy way to quit smoking when I was 24 and quit for months afterwards, only to find the book when having a clear out, chucking it out as I believed I didn’t need it anymore and smoking within 30 minutes of doing so. 

I have tried vaping, patches and gum, you name it. 

Smoking has always been my vice and I hate it. 

I will get stressed, crack and buy a 20 pack, smoke 10 of them and then run them under the cold water tap (so I don’t fish them out) and chuck them in the bin.

Now let me explain why it controls me so much, why I relapse every single time…

I forget. 

The emotional reasons behind quitting, the health anxiety, the disappointment I feel from my wife every time I do it, the guilt for my children, the embarrassment, the smell it leaves, the money it wastes and everything else… 

In that moment - usually around 4-5 days in to quitting once again… I forget.

I forget the reasons I wanted to quit, I forget the withdrawal I have gone through for the thousandth time and how short tempered and ill it made me feel for the past few days. In that moment where I crack, while I’m on the way to the shops to get them, I completely forget and focus only on feeding my addiction. I really mean that… it’s like it overwhelms me to the point where all my will power is gone and I forget everything. 

The first couple are nice, it feels like home. It feels like what I know and have always known. Then every single one after that gets worse and worse. Until I put them under the tap and chuck them. 

What the heck do I do to kick this. I have never regretted doing something so much in my life as this curse. 

I smoked 5 a day in my teens and probably 10-12 a day from age 20-24 and then 20 every 24 hours since. 

Question: who else has a similar relationship with it? Where you can summon willpower every time and kick it for 4-5 days, not even crave it and go through withdrawal. Only to complete that process and then forget and crack. 

I know loads of people that smoke or have smoked and the big difference seems to be that they never took breaks, one friend even said to me wow you stopped for 3 days? I think I would stop forever if I did that. 

I HAVE DONE THAT OVER 100 TIMES!

I just promised my 2 year old son I will quit for good. I pray I can do it.

I kept telling to people and had little to no concentration while I worked.

I ate a lot for the first 2 days to surpress the cravings which worked out well. Day 3 and 4 I had no problem just ignoring the cravings till they pass.

What really bugs me is not the physical craving, but the incredible positive emotions I have towards smoking whenever I think about it. In my mind it feels so relaxing, safe and rewarding. Ofcourse I know all the negatives of smoking and all the positives of not-smoking but this only works on a rational level.  The emotional level is completely in favour of smoking and I see no reason how this would ever change? I can easily surpress these positive emotions in favour of reasoning, but that cant be it? It feels bad, which is exactly the opposite of what I thought it would be like.",1764704339.0,10,3,stopsmoking,substance

1pc3aui,Stopped smoking,So I’ve been quitting vaping a month and one week ago today and I’m feeling much better after horrible weeks with a lot of withdrawals. But can anyone tell me how long it might take for the ‘out of breath / hard to inhale all in-feeling’ to pass? I need to say it’s only when I’m outside in the cold air and with a high pulse. But it’s really annoying not being able to breathe like I used to. My doctor says it’s normal weeks will pass before it’s completely gone in cold weather. What is your experience ? ,1764664268.0,6,1,stopsmoking,substance
1pc2ysd,"3 years smoke free, this is how i did it","i hope this might be helpfull for some people, three years ago one day i said i will quit smoking today. Ive been smoker since i had 15 years, so was more tan 12 years smoking, at one point i was getting very sick every single winter, so i got tires and i said today i quit.  
Recomendations to make it easier, start something new at the same time you quit smoking, something that you like and its good for you, make a savings pocket every time you want to buy a pack of cigarrettes just put the money there, at the end of each month grab that pocket and go shopping something that you want it feels like a real reward. 

If you have heavy cravings those desperate days do excersice, this helps a lot do it until the point you feel really tired, your body will start producing dopamine its a body hack that we all can use. 

Track your progress in health, each month theres some improve ent for your body, research that.

And the most important try to avoid places where people smoke a lot at least for the first months, if someone is smoking in your house ask kindly if they can do it outside to help you, this is a big game changer too.

You can do it!",1764662958.0,38,5,stopsmoking,substance
1pbtffy,High blood pressure AFTER quitting?,"Hi all,

I quit smoking about nine months ago after quitting smoking weed about fourteen months ago. I quit marijuana first, as I had a massive panic attack. I had smoked weed for about two years and cigarettes for about three (but oddly never smoked more than 2-3 in a day).

In the aftermath, I kept having heart palpitations, so I consulted a cardiologist to be safe. Turns out, I had high blood pressure (which is NOT good for someone who is 26). I have been taking 5mg amlodipine for almost a year as of now, and my BP is still on the high end of ""okay"" -- supposedly. For the last week I've been having weird headaches and worried that something is wrong -- these have ranged from palpable ""ow"" type pain to just a mild annoyance.

I'm seeing my cardiologists tomorrow, but I'm curious to see if anyone else has had this experience.",1764634211.0,6,3,stopsmoking,substance
1pbtdak,Anyone quit Zyn or other nicotine pouches and get symptoms later than expected?,"I’ve been using Zyn and other nicotine pouches for a long time and stopped using them 100% last week.

I didn’t taper just quit on the spot and now my withdrawals are hitting me way later than what Google says.  
Day 7 and 8 were the worst for me. Felt sick, tired, sweaty, emotional, everything.

Is this normal for people who used pouches? 

I keep seeing mixed info about nicotine tapering versus cold turkey, so I’m curious what your experience looked like.",1764634064.0,13,8,stopsmoking,substance

Being around people who smoke and just talking about smoking and cigarettes tempt me to buy a pack. My fuckin birthday is closing in and i feel like celebrating with cigs. The cigs never lost their temper with me  just saying!!! And holy shit even when i surprassed the year wo smoking i was having pleasant dreams with all the colorful packaging and the aromas of smoke shops. These things are insanely difficult to get off your mind. How is it that my best dreams involve going into a smoke shop!?

1pbozkh,I'm a raging B-tch and don't know what to do,"Hi I know this has been posted about a million times here but i quit vaping about three weeks ago, cold turkey, and my withdrawal symptoms feel like they're ripping me to shreds.
I'm barely sleeping, but I'm chronically fatigued so this is quite literally destroying my body.
I have never been so consistently angry and irritated in my entire life and i think it's actually starting to hurt my relationships. I work with children and I don't know if you've ever been around multiple whiny babies or toddlers when you're irritated and overstimulated but I've hit my tipping point a few times while at work and had to go home early because it's been too much at times.
And I've hurt my boyfriend's feelings enough that he's literally walking on eggshells around me constantly because he's afraid I'll snap at him.
I'm trying so hard to keep it contained too. I'm working out, trying to eat healthier, taking alone time, nothing is working to help.
I've heard it can take months for some people to get back to normal after quitting and I just don't know if i have that kind of time.
I guess I just need any kind of advice? Like I *know* it will get better eventually, but I hate feeling like this angry, awful person all the time. I used to be bright and bubbly and I've been called a completely different person by those that have known me since before I started vaping. I was never an angry person before this, I don't know what to do anymore.",1764623500.0,16,12,stopsmoking,substance
1pbgzcc,Day 34 Depression and Anxiety,"Hey Everyone, just joined the group! I am on day 35 of my vape quit and have been feeling awful since about day 9. I am going through periods of manic depression and extreme anxiety. I am also having brief stints of clarity and elation. I am worried this is going to go on forever. When do I go to see the doctor? Just want to feel happy and excited about everything again. I just feel down and tired most of the time at the moment. I was finishing a Lost Mary BM6000 Cola every 3-4 days, which is apparently quite heavy usage. Should I expect to to be feeling like this right now? Any one else feel the same at my stage? Everything I read has people saying it only lasted 3-4 weeks. I am passed that now and still no better.
