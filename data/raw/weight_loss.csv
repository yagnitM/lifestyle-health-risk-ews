1qamz9y,i don’t recognize myself so i’m changing today.,"i did a 20 minute workout today & i’m actually proud. i felt confident when i was 170-190lbs at the beginning of adulthood then ballooned up to 240 in about 2 years. got diagnosed with pcos, developed severe panic disorder & agoraphobia & was basically bed bound for 2 years due to my mental illness symptoms so my weight has been stagnant if not gone up. i’ve also struggled with alcoholism since my teens. 

lately when i look in the mirror i think i’m bigger than ever, i have a double chin from every angle, i can’t even “fake,” being smaller by sucking in, & my stamina is awful. so today i made a huge leap; i got up & did a 20+ minute guided workout from a youtube video. i’m feeling really motivated & hope i can keep it up. i just want to at least recognize myself in the mirror. i want to be attractive for my partner like i was the first few years, attractive for myself, & be able to actually do things. 

any beginner tips for someone who has been basically sedentary for a few years would be much appreciated!

i drink a lot of water as it is & my food isn’t awful, i just struggle with movement & activity.",1768197253.0,6,0,loseit,weight_loss
1qamdx7,How do you deal with the anxiety that comes with trying to lose weight?,"At least the exercise part is fine and simple. I kind of hate it, but love it at the same time. You just have to do a few things a number of times and move on to the next one. The only bad thing is that is way too mental taxing. It drains me emotionally and mentally a lot.

But with the diet, it's very different. My nutritionist has given me a diet, but it has too many carbohydrates (at least that's what I think). I have to cut them in half because I think there are too many. My nutritionist told me I had to stop obsessing over weighing my food and counting calories. He even told me I had to quit as a way of exposing myself, but I can't. If I did, the next day they'd find me sleeping with the fishes.  

I need to keep track of what I eat and drink. I have to record all my macronutrients and even the calories I burn when exercising (I only count 60% of them because I've read that there's a huge margin of error).

It's too much anxiety and stress. It's making me much more depressed than usual. I don't even know why I doubt him. In the past, thanks to him, I lost almost 40 lb in less than six months. Even so, I can't stop thinking about it. Is he too permissive or am I too restrictive? Maybe it's OCD?

1qalz9s,"★OFFICIAL WEEKLY★ Day 1 Monday: Start here! January 12, 2026","# Is today is your Day 1?

​**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

​So you aren’t sure of how to start? Don’t worry! “How do I get started?” is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

# Why You’re Overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends (unaffiliated) apps like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit](http://loseit.com/) or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers. You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it’s own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn’t necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don’t need perfect. We just want better.

1qalv1e,overcoming food noise; seeking advice,"hello everyone, i hope that this post finds you all well!! this is my first time posting in this sub after lurking for quite awhile and reading the stories of other, and i suppose that my goal today is to seek out advice for a few things.

(this may have a bit of rambling so please bear with me lol) to start off, i am a 19 yr old female and weigh around 177 pounds at 5’7. to me, this feels like quite a bit and i have been beside myself with negative self confidence along with a slew of depression on top of my typical depression and anxiety due to this negative self confidence. this all somewhat began a few years ago, in my early teens continuing into my young adulthood. i weighed something similar at the age of 15 i believe, and had similar very negative feelings and issues with negative self image. due to that, i ended up dropping to around 145 lbs i believe was my lowest? this was accomplished through monitoring what i ate heavily mainly, and not too much working out. losing this weight made me gain a great amount of confidence and honestly made me feel so much better in my skin. however, i have since gained a lot of the weight back, which as i stated before, is leading me into such an awful mentality. this weight gain could be a mix of me recently starting birth control, however i am aware that is mainly due to the fact that i seem to have uncontrollable food noise and am constantly thinking about food which leads to great amounts of overeating and sometimes binging.

**to get to the point,** my question is, what are some strategies that you guys have used to overcome this food noise and lose weight along with keeping it off? i feel that i need some sort of mental reset, and i don’t want food to overcome me anymore. due to the slews of depression that i seem to fall into, working out also seems so daunting to me as well, however i would know to know if anyone has any tips on getting over that daunting feeling when it comes to working out as well.

i appreciate you taking the time to read this post and thank you!",1768193727.0,1,6,loseit,weight_loss
1qals0f,I didn't realize how much alcohol was sabotaging my progress until I stopped,"My last drink was on January 1st and even after only 10 days I'm realizing how much drinking was disrupting my ability to lose weight. Now I'm not so hungry all the time and I don't constantly crave junk food, I'm much more able to stop eating even if there's still more food in front of me, and I'm actually motivated enough to get regular exercise and cook healthy meals instead of ordering takeout or eating something out of the freezer. I did not realize how much alcohol was amplifying the food noise even days after I'd had a drink, not giving into cravings felt nearly impossible sometimes and I'd always find one way or another to rationalize my decision to eat something unhealthy. Really hoping this trend continues, I'd like to actually find long term success with weight loss this time",1768193467.0,19,7,loseit,weight_loss
1qalc6o,unhealthy relationship with food,"Please bare with me, as I think I'm at my wits end. 

I'm 24f who's pushing 250. 
I hate myself. I hate the relationship I have with food. 
I hate the way I feel the need to finish the food sat in front of me. THAT I SAT IN FRONT OF ME. 
I'm tired of making my self big portions, of horrible food. 
I'm tired of taking huge bites and chewing so fast. 
I don't know I why I do this to myself, I don't know if it's the stress or boredom. Or if it's the fear and loneliness I feel.
I was about 11/12 when I started eating more. Sneaking food at night to the point my grand parents put alarm locks on the fridge and it felt like a mission to crack the code to the fridge. 
When I heard food steps coming up the stairs I would run to my room and throw the food I took under my pillow. 

I don't like the way my tummy hangs or the way people look at me. 
Sometimes I love myself but most of the time I feel like a fat slob. 

I've done this to myself and I need to fix it before I have health issues someday. 

I just don't know where to begin. 

I want to be able to treat food as fuel for my body.. I don't know. 
I'm sorry this is such a mess. I looked at myself in the mirror and I just hated who I saw. 

I miss feeling pretty.. I don't know anymore. 😕

is there anything I can do to help myself, push myself more than ever? 

I used to dance and cheer as a child, till maybe 14. 
I found some dance workouts from the fitness Marshall and made a playlist. 
Im going to try and make it a point to dance an hour a day and start there. 

I'm sorry for rambling.. I just simply don't know who else to talk to or where to turn right now friends. ",1768192145.0,3,10,loseit,weight_loss

1qajf3n,Best tasting Whey Protein for weight loss?,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently walking 10k steps a day and trying to hit 100g of protein daily while staying in a calorie deficit.

I have to watch my cholesterol, so I can't rely on eating 3-4 eggs a day like I used to. I need to switch to Whey Protein to hit my numbers.

I'm looking for recommendations on which brand actually tastes good.

• My constraints: I need it to be relatively low calorie/low fat.

• The flexibility: I don't need it to be ""Zero Cholesterol"" or ""Zero Carb"" if that makes it taste like chalk. I’m okay with a small amount of cholesterol if it means the texture and flavor are genuinely enjoyable.

Questions:

1. What brand do you look forward to drinking?

2. Do you mix it with water, almond milk, or something else to keep calories low but taste high?

3. Any specific flavors that are ""safe bets"" (e.g., is Chocolate usually better than Vanilla for covering up the protein taste)?

* Gender: Male
* Age: 28 Years Old
* Height: 6 feet 2 inches | 187.9 centimeters
* Weight: 158.7 pounds | 72 kilograms



I wanted to reduce my belly fat and make my love handles least noticeable (it's pretty evident when I was leaning forward to play pool and they took a picture of me from behind). I was really self-conscious about someone taking a photo of me ever since I started getting belly fat and love handles in High School. And whenever I go to the pool or beach, I always have to wear my shirt on.

I'm at a lost on how to do it especially since I don't really have any knowledge when it comes to nutritional diet or stuff related to losing fat/weight. And due to work, I don't really have time to hit the gym. I don't really care if losing it takes a long time, a progress is still a progress no matter how small it may be.



Here is an insight on what my weekly activities (it's pretty much the same thing every week).

Job/Work

* 12 hours a day
* 5-6 shifts a week
* factory work
* mainly operating machinery all day, standing most of the time with sufficient walking

Routine (when I have work)

* wake up
* stretching then exercise
* wash and rinse face with cold water
* breakfast
* work
* dinner
* shock shower (slightly hot throughout and finish with cold water for 2 minutes)
* sleep

Routine (when I don't have work)

* wake up
* stretching then exercise
* wash and rinse face with cold water
* breakfast
* laundry
* lunch
* walk the dogs
* dinner
* shock shower
* sleep

Stretching (normally last 5mins give or take)

* right arm up and bend upper body to the left, do the other side after (25 reps)
* 1 full rotation of hips (25 reps)
* 1 knee up as high as I can while standing, and do the other side (25 reps), it's like when soldiers are marching
* both arms locking in front of the chest and then twist upper body as far as able (25 reps)
* back arm stretch (25 seconds each)

Exercise (normally last 20mins give or take)

* sit-ups (25 reps)
* knee push-ups (25 reps)
* crunches (25 reps)
* planking (50 secs)

Breakfast (I do switch them out, like cereal for today and then bagel the next)

* cereal (spoon of chia seeds, spoon raisins, oat milk, and 1 banana)
* or 1 ""everything"" bagel with cream cheese+dark chocolate chips as spread

Lunch/Dinner

* white+brown rice mix (2 scoops amount) along with any meat and veggies from the fridge
* sometimes, I used frozen veggies if there are no cooked ones

Everyday Snacks (1 fruit, 2 cheese strings, and flavored yogurt)

* banana, apple, or orange paired with 2 cheese strings/sticks
* yogurt with either blueberries or strawberries chunks in it



When I first started with this routine almost 4 months ago, I could barely do 10 reps on the exercise part before my body gives out especially planking. When I first tried it, my body started shaking after 20 seconds lol.

Also, I don't drink or smoke. Family also have Friday night (either pizza or popeyes paired with carbonated drink) that happens once a month. Other than that, I always drink 2 glass of water after every meal and 1 glass before bed.



I remember seeing several posts when I was doing some research and the most popular food that people recommend is chicken breast, steamed broccoli, brown rice, and a bit of hot sauce to taste. Is this this the mainstream meal when trying to lose weight/fat?

My plan so far is to powerwalk over 10,000 steps per day (and possibly jog a bit when the weather warms up. I may also bike) and monitor my diet. Want to be that weight be end of June. Diet is as follows:

Breakfast: Tea, a bit of half and half, a bit of sugar (less than a spoonful) - I am not a breakfast person and never regularly have it. 

Lunch: Salad, a few croutons, carrots, small amount of Lite Italian dressing. I might add a sprinkle of parmesan  cheese. 

Snack: Banana (only if I'm craving it)

Dinner: Baked chicken (various recipes) with 2 roasted vegetables. Might do a burger or pasta night on occasion. 

Also, drinking a lot of water at meals and during the day. 

I calculated my resting rate is 1,700 calories. The walking will boost me to around 2,000 calories. The diet will be around 1,000 calories. So, I should have a 1,000 calorie deficit. ",1768181090.0,0,4,loseit,weight_loss

It’s been about 6 days since I started this, but I was at about 1800 before that. I had been pretty good with maintaining this deficit and eating mindfully. I have lost about 3lbs since Monday. Things were pretty stable until today….I have been under a lot of stress. Between work, planning for the new school year, wedding planning, and the chaos of the new year, I am mentally drained. On top of that, today was the first day of my cycle, and my energy is tanked. We didn’t get a chance to go to the store, so my options for lunch and dinner were plain toast or frozen broccoli. Needless to say, I opted for convenience and comfort over my diet today and I’m definitely at maintenance. 

I know that tomorrow is a new day, but I am feeling pretty defeated. Does anyone else experience days like this? How do you handle them? I feel that my weight loss and maintenance goals are pretty reasonable, but at the same time, it feels so daunting. Like I’m standing at the base of a mountain, and I have to get to the top and I’m not sure where the trail begins.

1qah09v,Questioning weight loss coach,"
I started working with a weight loss coach about two weeks ago with the specific goal of losing weight. As part of her approach, she has me increasing my calorie intake before we begin a calorie deficit, which I’m struggling to feel comfortable with and honestly don’t fully agree with.

Her explanation is that I “wasn’t eating enough” prior to working with her, and that if she were to put me into a deficit immediately, my calories would end up being too low to be sustainable or healthy. While I understand the concern about overly aggressive cuts, this still feels counterintuitive to me.

My understanding has always been that weight loss fundamentally comes down to calories in versus calories out. Before working with her, I was clearly overeating relative to my needs, which is why I gained weight in the first place. Because of that, increasing calories now feels confusing and a bit uncomfortable, especially when my primary goal is fat loss.

I’m trying to stay open-minded, but I’m having a hard time reconciling this approach with what I thought was a straightforward CICO model. I’d really appreciate hearing if others have experience with a similar “reverse before a cut” strategy, whether it worked for them, and what the rationale or benefits actually were in practice.

1qaedn5,Tips for weekend eating?,"Over the last few weeks I have been a bit more mindful of what/how much I am eating; it's not been perfect, and I definitely over indulged a bit over Christmas, but overall it is better than normal, and I am down 5kg in just a few weeks.

My main problem is keeping on track during weekends and days off work. Through the week I will stick to the breakfast - lunch - dinner routine easier because I am busy at work or only have a few hours spare after work. On weekends, it's a different story. I dont have the routine of going to work, so my meal times are all over the place, and I snack a lot out of boredom. The easy answer to this is to go out away from food, but I have jobs around the house and college assignments to do, it's also the only time I get to play computer games. (Often the games can consume my attention, meaning I ignore the other tasks, but that's a different issue)

I really struggle keeping a routine on weekends, throwing off the whole diet consistency, and easily wipe out any deficit I have built during the week. Obviously this is frustrating, and is one of the biggest issues I have faced with my weight loss attempts in the past, so I need some suggestions for getting this under a bit more control.

One easy thing I could try is sticking to the same sleep schedule, bed at 11pm and getting up at 7am, as much as I hate getting up early. Right now, I generally wake up between 9am and 10am, which in theory means less time to eat, and less requirement for 3 meals in the day. In reality I either cram the 3 meals in a shorter time frame, or I don't eat any proper meals and just snack all day.",1768173427.0,1,5,loseit,weight_loss

For reference, I’m 26, 6ft 4 and weight about 115kg. Was at around 115/116kg all through 2023, then managed to lose about 6kg in 2024, then due to being away from home for a large part of 2025, have pretty much regained all the weight.

My biggest challenge I have is I don’t feel like my weight limits me much, so keeping the motivation to cut out/reduce food intake is challenging. For example, last year I played 3 rounds of golf in a day last year, 5 rounds in 2.5 days. Plus, I own a Peloton and have done multiple 2 hour rides, and been on many walks over 10km for example. 

Basically, I don’t necessarily feel ‘unfit’ and not being able to exercise isn’t an issue, and therefore I think I have a kind of mental block to keeping the motivation to put the hard work in to lose weight.

1qa4irj,In Scale We Trust - BIA Accuracy,"It's my understanding that Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) scales are better for tracking trends, which is what I've been doing since 11/29. I've also been tracking with a regular scale since I started the diet on 11/1, and I've been taking progress pictures since 11/3. I've been exercising every day, alternating between resistance training and zone 2 cardio in addition to getting an average of 12k steps. I've been eating \~1g protein per pound of muscle (not per pound of bodyweight) 

I'm a fairly intermediate lifter, and I've been lifting before starting this diet on 11/1. On 9/13, I was able to perform 6 chinups at a bodyweight of 199, and on 1/7, I was able to perform 9 chinups at a bodyweight of 187 with an additional 22 pounds of resistance in the form of plates attached to a belt. Another point of reference is that I was able to increase my 12rm on barbell bench press by 15 pounds since 11/28.

I started the diet on 11/1 at a bodyweight of 203 and am currently at a bodyweight of 183. My progress in the gym and my progress pictures are impressive. I'm just struggling with the BIA scale.

With my 20 pounds of weight loss, I wasn't using BIA the entire time. Since I started using it, the BIA scale suggests that I have decreased my body fat percentage by 1.8%, which is encouraging when I look at the numbers as a %. However, when I look at the numbers as totals, it suggests that I have lost 3.7 pounds of muscle and 5.2 pounds of fat.

That's discouraging. This is my first time using a BIA scale. Is it normal to lose nearly 4 pounds of muscle while doing everything optimally with my diet and nutrition, building strength in the gym, and seeing noticeable progress through my pictures? 

Most of the advice I see online is that you won't lose any muscle if you're doing everything right. I was told that on a cut, expect some muscle loss, especially with aggressive deficits or long durations, but you can minimize it by aiming for 0.5-1% bodyweight loss per week, prioritizing high protein (around 1g/lb), lifting heavy, and keeping cuts under 12-16 weeks to preserve muscle and strength. Expect strength to dip as you get leaner, but slow, steady fat loss keeps muscle intact.

I currently have another 2 weeks to go before I give myself a break. I took a mini break over the Christmas holiday. I have been losing about 1% bodyweight per week, and I started at 20% body fat, for reference, according to the BIA scale. I also realize that not all of the 20 pounds I lost is tissue, as significant water loss (often 2-4% of body weight) happens due to depleting glycogen (which holds water). 

What do you think? What should I think? I will post body progress pictures separately in a couple of weeks when it's all over, if that is something people are interested in. Thanks.

I am getting desperate. I have reached the highest weight I've ever had in my life and it feels like I can't do anything right.

I have PCOS and I have had little to no help from my doctor. I just got back and they're pushing for me to get an injection. I think it's a GLP-1 but I can't remember. I am nervous about this and would like to avoid it if possible. I was also recommended to try their weight loss program but I tried that during my ED and all I got out of it was going in every two weeks to track my weight and being told I'm not trying hard enough.

I have been struggling for years and developed an ED that nearly ended me. So I'm trying to figure out how to do this because I am given so much ""advice"" that I don't know where to even start. I keep everything in Samsung Health but I feel like I'm estimating a lot because I don't have the nutritional facts there. I also cannot achieve 10k steps a day because I work in an office that demands I stay at my desk. I've tried going for walks on my lunch break but now I'm finding out skin cancer is an active threat in my family; I've done sunscreen but between that sitting on my skin and the sweating, it makes me feel disgusting for the rest of my shift.

I'm sure I left things out but I am at a complete loss as to what to do.",1768150666.0,0,12,loseit,weight_loss
1qa4173,When measuring/weighing everything & making sure you have a balanced meal feels like too much work,"I'm hungry but I don't really feel like eating because I have to measure and weigh everything and put thought into making something that is well-rounded, with protein and carbs and fiber. I have some go-to meals that hit all of those marks really well for a good calorie count but I don't feel like eating those meals. 

And what's even more annoying is that I have low blood sugar so I can't really skip a meal for too long before I feel sick. 

I miss being able to just sit down with leftover pasta or make a baked potato and call it a day and not worry about adding protein, etc. ",1768149739.0,15,14,loseit,weight_loss
1qa2usq,Denial.,"I’m having trouble accepting my progress? This is the first time of trying to lose weight that I have had any success at all. Today I have officially lost 20.5 pounds. I actually can not believe it. Not in the excited, like wow look at me go, kind of can’t believe it. Like I actually don’t believe it. I’ve weighed myself 5 times, I put my dog on the scale to see if it weighed her correctly, I’m considering buying a new scale because there is just no way.

I don’t know why I feel this way. Maybe it’s because I can’t physically see the change? I still have a long way to go. My start weight was 286 pounds and today I am (allegedly) 265.5 pounds. Or may I failed so many times I accidentally convinced my subconscious that I could never do it?

At some point i looked at myself in the mirror, and I noticed i didn't look like someone who's been working out a lot. Some muscles show, its clear my overall frame has somewhat reduced, but overall I still look chubby. And as I was having the look, a flashback of last night hit me. 

I had pasta, some snacks and some chicken. Then I remembered I had a cider, and there was some raspberry cheesecake I had a bit of as well. It really is my diet, and I'm realising no matter how many times I come to the gym or go on walks or runs, if I don't fix my diet it will almost feel like I'm achieving nothing.

1q9vhir,Would a almost entirely fruit diet be good for weight loss?,"I love fruit, but my understanding was always that you should not eat too much fruit because of high sugar content. However, I’ve just checked the calories of fruit. Most fruits are 50-60 calories per 100 grams. That would mean that you’d need like 3kg of fruit to reach 1800 calories. You could never eat that in a day. How can a fruit diet NOT be good for weight loss? At such a low calorie count does it still matter that fruit has high sugar?

I know there’s also the question of macro nutrients, and this shouldn’t be ignored, but for purposes of intellectual curiosity maybe we can ring fence that as a seperate point for a moment and address the weight loss point separately?",1768125046.0,0,18,loseit,weight_loss

1q9t5cu,Locking in - any advice for my plans to lose 50lbs by the summer?,"Weight has always been a struggle for me - I've weighed between 180-200lbs ever since I was around 12-13y/o. Now I'm a 29 year old woman who *still* struggles with weight. For a few years I dropped, one of those years being down to 125lbs but it was stress induced, didn't last and I felt like garbage. Honestly, I'm less concerned about the number on the scale and just want to feel and look healthy again - my goal weight is where I'm comfortable.. I've always had a lot of muscle mass so 130-140 is ""small"" for me. In an ideal world, I'll hit my goal weight by July. 

Height: 5'2""

SW/CW: 195lbs

GW: 140lbs

I struggle with cardio - between the cold weather and the weight, I think I'm getting asthma... will be checking in with a doc soon to see if I can get an inhaler/check in, but alas, I don't have a family doctor. So in the meantime I'm doing ""careful"" cardio, not pushing my lungs but trying to get 15-30min of cardio with my heart rate 150-160bpm, along with 45min-1hour of strength training. Realized today I sit in the hypertrophy weight lifting with 8-12 reps where I'm hitting muscle tremors at the end of a set, if that makes a difference.

I'm going to start tracking my calories again... I'd say I average 1500-2200 calories a day, generally healthy eating but there's room for improvement. I'm considering doing alternate day fasting because I find that I feel physically better if I go long stretches without eating anyway, so it seems feasible for me. 1200-1500cal on feast days, 500 on fast days. 

I want to keep going to the gym 3-4 days a week to rebuild muscle, but I feel like I'm not helping myself by only doing 15-30 minutes of cardio each time. Once winter breaks I'll be adding more hikes, but until then, most of my exercise will be at the gym.

1q9s3pi,How I finally lost weight eating basically only prepackaged food,"I’ve lost a bit of weight and then gained it back countless times. I would get too ambitious and try to recreate all of those high-protein, low-calorie recipes I saw on Instagram and they would just take up too much of my time after work. I also hated eating the same meal prepped food and didn’t like taking the time to divide every recipe to make it fit one meal rather than a meal prep either. I realized my downfall was that cooking was just taking up too much time/brainpower, making ordering/high-calorie snacks the easy option. 

So, I made eating low-calorie, filling, high-protein meals the easy option by choosing healthyish prepackaged food. This method also made tracking so much easier and increased my diet’s flexibility. I got healthyish precooked protein (minimally breaded chicken nuggets, chicken sausage, chicken meatballs, turkey bacon, anything with more protein than fat or carbs basically) For carbs I got: precooked rice, pasta, oats, low-calorie wraps. For vegetables I exclusively got frozen bags and only ate them steamed in the microwave (saves so much oil and allows me to eat fattier meats). For my meals I would mix and match my carbs, proteins, and veggies into a slop bowl of whatever I felt like at the time and fits my macros. I also had a wide array of low-calorie sauces (hot sauce, mustard, G Hugh’s sweet chili (my fav!), etc.) cooking each meal took less than 10 min, which was the amount of time it took to microwave my veggies, carbs, and heat up my protein.

I do yoga most mornings and have been trying to get back into running so I dont really know how much I should be eating or what food is good for trying to lose weight when most of what the recommendations are not something I can do.

1q9p9kg,What are realistic expectations to achieve with a better diet / exercise after 1mo?,"I'm curious what thoughts are on what could be realistically achieved if I actually started exercising/working out, and eating better. I just want to have good expectations going in.

Currently, I don't exercise, and all foods I eat are processed / fast food.

I eat something small in the morning around 10am, like a 2 pack Fiorucci panino. Then something like chips at 2pm, and then dinner at 7pm is 90% of the time just a standard combo from a fast food place.

At most, I will drink 20 - 30oz water. And always an addition to an equal or slightly greater amount in soda. 20 - 40oz. I've realized I eat more in response to stress, and also just boredom. Weekends, but today specifically, was especially worse.

And I just feel sick.

from 4:30am to 8pm, I have consumed:

calories: 3370 (700 of this is guesstimate average on unmarked sweets)

sodium: 4870

sugar: 116

Average for most week days:

calories: 1860  (sometimes add +230)

Sodium: 2840

sugar: 75 (sometimes add +60)

I'm 5'10"" (177cm), 174lbs (79kg).

5 years ago I weighed 135lbs (61kg).

A bit ago I did try to eat less and lose some weight when I was at my most (183lbs/83kg). But what really got me was uhh some bad stuff that happened. I basically didn't eat for a week (I'm fine now), and I was down to 165lbs (75kg). But obviously, started to gain it back, cause I went back to eating more. and that's not a great way to do things anyways. (I didn't do it to lose weight, I know that's bad, it was just a side effect).

Anyways.

Basically, I'm wondering what's normal amount of fat/muscle distribution change and weight change, to expect in 1mo time.

1q9nttp,Struggling to consume more than 1k calories a day. Is it safe if I don't really feel hungry?,"I gained 30 lbs in the last year. I'm 5'11 and typically weigh around 165-170. I've always generally eaten healthy but the weight gain was due to just extreme binge drinking. I've stopped drinking since the new year and started back on counting calories. 

Every day, I eat 2 russet potatoes, 2 eggs, 1 cucumber, 1 banana, and bowl of rice/beans/corn/garbanzo beans/tomatoes/mock chicken. Depending on the size of the banana and potatoes, this hits about 900-1k calories. These are 100% accurate as I don't use any oils and weigh everything. The only other things I add are hot sauce and garlic/onion powder. 

The problem is, I know that eating this little is not ideal but I just don't feel that hungry. If I do feel hungry, I typically eat a cucumber or banana and that fixes it.

1q9njut,Frustrated/tired of weight loss,"I (28M 5’9) started my journey from about 210 all the way down to about 147 at my lowest around a year and a half ago. Got super healthy with lots of cardio and more lifting again (been lifting for a long time) 3-5 times a week. Tons of steps etc. 

I think I’m at a decision point though. I’ve been hanging around 150 for like 4 months. Sometimes above if I have a cheat day or two and sometimes below if I’m serious about trying to get to the next low weight. My girlfriend and family say I’m so skinny now. I never thought I’d see that as a rude comment. I feel like I lost a tad bit of muscle. I’m not super muscular but I’m also not a noodle, more like a runner build or slightly stalkier than that. You can see my cheekbones if in depleted of glycogen and water. When I do get that low I do think to myself that I look rather skinny, but my abs still aren’t defined fully unless I flex, and the bottom two just don’t exist. But I have veins all over my calf’s, arms, and even thighs sometimes… I guess I don’t store fat well. 

My goal was to get visible abs, and although I kinda have them if I am depleted but I feel like I can’t go lower, I’m super skinny and at my height and weight if I go below 147 I end up binging and yo yo ing. 

Never really took a proper diet break and I think now might be the time? Or even a lean bulk to build up muscle?

I’m 5’5” SW 205 CW 187, female, but I’ve teetered between 189 and 187 the past two weeks— score I was steadily dropping 1.9 lbs per week then suddenly I haven’t seen any real weight loss for the past 2. I have a long history of eating disorders so after years of therapy, I am being extremely intentional not to drop too low with my calories or do anything too aggressive. I love to exercise, but at this point in time to avoid disordered thinking, I am simply doing calorie restriction with about 10,000 steps four times a week and the other three days I am at work, but my job is on my feet a lot.  I am looking forward to adding in weightlifting once I am closer to my goal weight, but I know myself, and if I do that now, I am definitely going to get in my head and fall back on old disordered patterns.

I almost always consume between 1350 and 1470 cal a day. I eat primarily whole foods, I love vegetables, and I’m consuming 100-110 g of protein each day.

I think I just need reassurance that plateaus are normal. I saw in another post that if I continue to just stay in my healthy deficit and don’t make any changes, it will eventually break, so I would love some input from you. Based on physics alone, it has to eventually break, right? How long does it typically take for that to happen? I think knowing that will help me relax a little bit.

Is it possible that the calories I shared are too high already? I keep hearing that when plateaus happen it probably means you aren’t in a deficit any longer, but if that were the case, wouldn’t the plateau have come on gradually and not all of a sudden? And I feel like less than 1300 is too low realistically for a person who gets regular movement.  Like, it doesn’t make sense that I am in a calorie deficit one day but the next day I suddenly am not any longer.

Thank you so much for reading! It’s just so important to me to see this through in a healthy and measured way. I plan to be in it for the long haul but just want to ease my fears that my body is somehow broken or never going to lose the weight I want to lose so badly.",1768093920.0,0,16,loseit,weight_loss
1q9l75w,"Obesity cost me more than $33,000","I have never properly looked at my finances. I would glance occasionally at my banking app and notice my uber eats order was a hefty amount on the receipt but I was more focused on the list of tasty food that I was about to feast on. Today, after spending around 10 hours learning a few things about spreadsheets, I finally looked into it.

I went to the website version of my banking app and looked to export all the transactions for my current account. The app was able to go back to the start of 2022, so I downloaded everything from the start of 2022 to the end of 2025. I put it all on google sheets, did some fancy spreadsheet magic, and put every transaction into a category and subcategory. For me, the main thing I cared about was the food costs so I had a category for food, and within that category it was split into Groceries, and Takeout, my only two sources of food. After putting everything into their categories, I made a waterfall chart to show the sum of all transactions within each category so I can see the overall impact they had in those 4 years I won't be able to share the chart here because of the image restrictions but I hope you'll believe these crazy numbers:

In those 4 years:

||Spent on Food (in GBP)|Spent on Food (in USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Takeout|24,413.75|32,731.52|
|Groceries|480.80|644.60|
|Grand Total|**24,894.55**|**33,376.12**|

Seeing this number made my heart drop. What was I doing with my life? Why was I so oblivious? This was *just* the last 4 years? How much was spent before then? I didn't just gain tons of fat. I paid thousands upon thousands to gain tons of fat. Fat that is ruining my life. Fat that is making it hard to move, hard to breathe, hard to **live**. I spent an unthinkable amount of money to make my life harder.

When people usually say obesity will ruin your future, they are talking about your health. They are talking about the diabetes, the heart attacks, the strokes, the organ failure, the bone and muscle breakdown and so on. They talk about the cost of health, but I have not come across anyone who mentioned the cost of money.

If anyone thinks this is a bit of a myopic capitalistic lens on the issue let me remind you, money defines your future health too. It determines your ability to afford healthcare costs, it determines your age of retirement, it determines your very ability to shape your environment, one of the most significant factors for losing weight.

When I got to 22 years old at 127kg last year, seeing that number on the scale and myself in the mirror was my wake up call. Today, seeing this number on my chart, was the caffeine that will keep me awake for the rest of my life.

People may lie to you, but the numbers never will.

P.S I'm seeing a recurring response that the numbers don't look correct so I want to clarify a few things. I don't live alone, I live with my family. This means that they already get most of the groceries and I occasionally chip in. This calculation is not an estimation of how much money **total** it took to gain all my weight, but rather **how much money I personally spent on food beyond what I already had**. I was not only ordering all this takeout, but I was eating whatever my family made for me on top of that. So when you think about it, this number **is actually an estimate of the minimum amount of money that has went towards my weight**, which makes the statistics more concerning than face value. Another response I'm noticing is ""If you don't spend that money on the takeout, you'll still end up spending just as much on the groceries"". I completely disagree with this. I haven't made the exact calculations, but in my time learning how to cook a few things in the past few months, I've noticed how little I actually end up spending per number of servings when I buy the raw ingredients which yield me multiple days worth of food compared to an individual takeout order on Uber Eats / Deliveroo. For example, I could order a 2pc chicken meal from kfc for £7.99 (This is the meal itself, it doesn't include the exorbitant fees Uber Eats adds on top). Alternatively, I could walk to Lidl in about 15 mins (already losing calories lets go), get a whole chicken and 2kg of potatoes (which matches up the macronutrient profile of the kfc meal while still being healthier because \*im not frying\*) which might cost me around £7 total, but provides at least double if not triple the calories of the kfc meal. I know I did not include the cost of other ingredients but I'm sure a lot of money is saved. I think I'll go as far as to say that $33,000 figure could be cut in half with a good meal plan and capitalizing on good deals but maybe I'm just too optimistic for my own good :)",1768092874.0,244,82,loseit,weight_loss
1q9kbpa,Stuck- how to stop bingeing?,"Hi everyone! I (25F) started my weight loss journey in January of 2025. I started at 230 pounds, and through walking and a healthy diet, I landed at 186 by April. I got to 181 before rebounding… the fall/winter season brought travel and thanksgiving meals and cookies… I’m scared to weigh myself but if I had to guess, I’m back at 190-195.

I have been eating A LOT. I have always been a binge eater, and I was really good about it until a few months ago. I will eat when I’m not hungry. I will eat bad foods when I have healthy ones in the house. I will eat just to taste something/chew something.

I walk 10,000 steps a day (actually average 13k) and have done so every single day for 1 year 🎉. That’s probably the only reason I haven’t shot back up to 230.

Every day, I think “I can do this, I’m motivated, tomorrow I’m going to eat X for lunch and Y for dinner and that’s it!” Then I go and eat whatever’s in sight or give into cravings.

Honestly, when I’m PMSing, my cravings are what really breaks my healthy habits. I also start craving salt and feel like I NEED some chips or something to be satiated.

I feel a little lost on what to do. I would be really happy getting down to 170, but it feels like there’s such a long road ahead. I briefly got into running, but my doctors told me to stop due to my asthma. I play pickleball too, but have to hit the inhaler multiple times when I play.

But I noticed an issue where I was becoming a bit skinny fat, not saying I’d lost a lot of weight yet, since at 164 cm I’m 56 kilos, I just was struggling with the fact that outside of clothes I wasn’t happy with how I really looked.

For context, I'm 4'11 and (last time I weighed) 71kg. I've always felt that my weight has stopped me wearing the clothes I want and ruined many a girls-day out. So I've taken 2026 as my year to change.

My initial plan was to do 30 mins on the cross-trainer every day and try to cut down calories by going low carb, high protein. I've been consistent and it gets me sweating and moving which is good! The only thing I'm worried about is that apparently it's a very slow way of losing weight... Only 1 week in and already feeling de-motivated! Maybe it's unrealistic, but I'd love to see real progress by the time the 6 month mark rolls around...

So I made the decision this evening to try changing every other day of cross-training into a HIIT YouTube video instead. It's a \***lot**\* harder, so I'm hoping it doesn't make me lose more motivation! Just doing push-ups on my knees makes me want to give up...

I'm still to scared to go into a gym and try messing with the weights. Not because I'm scared of the people in there judging me, but more the fact that I'd just end up staring at the weights rack. I have no clue about form, what exercises do what, what a rep is? I most definitely can't afford a personal trainer...

I like making salads (Lettuce, diced chicken, red onion and avocado with a mustard salad dressing is my current fav!) but looking for a hot meal that I like enough to be repeatable has been TOUGH!

I am currently 235\~ lbs at 5'3, 5'4 on a good day and hopefully I can hit like 225 considering healthy weight loss is around 1lb/week. 

I have no plans of bettering my health in any other aspect. I'll add walking in spring and working out in summer. Maybe. I don't know, we're still balls deep in winter.

""But why wait until then? You can be a better person now!"" I know, but I don't want to so therefore I'm not going to. I'm just going to start with the absolute basic item which is counting calories and then move on from there. 

It's not my first time either, I've went as low as 180lbs and I'm really kicking myself for allowing myself to get back up to like 240lbs but whatever, we're here now.

If you also have goals or would like to set any goals for the rest of winter please share below as community helps a lot.

1q9dmty,weight loss ads,"I went on a successful weight loss journey from March to September of last year, from 174 to 150 pounds. Unfortunately I got complacent and now I'm back up to 156. So here I am again! My original goal was 140 and I obviously didn't even reach that but I was pretty happy at 150 so I'd like to get there again, at least. 140 might be too low for my frame (my face starts looking a little skeletor-like lol).

Anyway, my question is really, I'm wondering if anyone else noticed a shift in their social media advertising around the new year? I try to stay off instagram but around late December I noticed that all of a sudden 90% of the ads I saw were either for GLP-1s, some other weight loss program/app, or plastic surgeons. Like literally bombarded with before and after pictures. I tried blocking every account when they popped up but then I realized that's probably hurting, not helping, the algorithm cuz I was visiting the pages. It seems to have slowed down now and is kind of back to giving me more regular ads. But wow, that was intense, and wildly triggering!! I don't know if they targeted me because I'm just a 30-something year old woman? I hadn't been searching for weight loss related anything, anywhere, and I certainly have never looked into plastic surgery. 

Anyone else get targeted for ""body-changing"" ads around the new year? And how did it make you feel? I obviously tried to ignore them but in general I was still feeling that ""New Year New Me means your body is wrong and gross and terrible and you need to change it"" thing I get every year so I feel like those ads somehow work even if I tell myself to ignore them.

Trying to come from a place of love, not hate, to get back down to my preferred weight. Sometimes I just struggle with the whole thing, though. ",1768074483.0,0,6,loseit,weight_loss
1q9dc2d,Always Hungry After Extreme Dieting,"I’m 23F ,5'3 and 60 kg I was on and off in a calorie deficit for about two months. Then a few days ago, I did an extreme diet where I only ate 600-700 calories a day and I lost around 4 kg in few days. I had to lose weight urgently for a specific reason, and I know it was unhealthy and not a sustainable way to lose weight.
Now that I’m back to a normal diet, I feel extremely hungry all the time. Even after eating full meals, I still feel unsatisfied and want to keep eating. I try to eat healthy foods like fruits, chicken, eggs, and other nutritious options, but the hunger doesn’t seem to go away. Because of this, I feel like I’m overeating and losing control of my appetite.
I want to understand why this is happening to my body after dieting for so long and how I can fix it in a healthy way without gaining too much weight back.",1768073787.0,0,22,loseit,weight_loss

Ive been trying to go from 56kg to 52 for the past two months and whatever i do, i cannot go that low for the life of me. I’ve managed to go to 55 but not lower than that cause i end up binging and undoing all my progress. I workout 5 times per week on average and i still dislike the way i look.

1q99p4j,Desperately need motivation,"Male, 32yo, 21 stone 4lbs (135ish kg), BMI is 46.7. I’ve been overweight for a very long time. As a kid I was bullied for being overweight, lost it all in my late teens then from around 20 onwards I’ve just piled it on. 

Every time I get motivated to do something about it, I do it for a month or so (gym, eating healthy, walking, working out at home) and then something will come up (e.g I’ll be sick or stressed from work or something) and I’ll just go back to eating rubbish. 

I’ve never had a healthy relationship with food, that on top of my lack of motivation I just don’t know what to do with myself. 

I’m at the point now where I’m feeling so run down and got multiple health conditions (like GERD) which I’m 99% sure are down to my weight. 

I know if I carry on I’m going to end up in an early grave, which should be motivation enough, but even that isn’t giving me a kick up the ass. 

The slightest inconvenience in my day causes me to eat something rubbish.

1q994mr,Low cal sub for calorie dense foods,"I binge HARD on the weekends and it's a habit that is hard for me to switch. I'm hoping to get some low cal subs that are good to binge on! I dont find celery or pickles that tasty so im hoping for some more creative or tasty ones that can sub my junk foods.

The ones I am LOVING so far are:

1)70 cal ice cream bars- they are SO good! Normally one is good enough but i love having the capacity of being able to eat two if i want (i mostly do that on a Saturday)

2) Diet 7up: Absolute game changer. Really enjoy it!!

3) Popcorn: i love popcorn but find the dry ones with no butter make me choke (lol). So hopefully trying to find better subs for that

I don’t binge at all, but I will eat things I don’t consciously want to eat in terms of my goals (like pastries, snacks, etc) because my brain wants some dopamine so bad. I’m on Wellbutrin right now for adhd along with extended release adderal, and that helps a tad, but I’ve been curious about contrave, or adding naltrexone to my Wellbutrin. Obviously I’m going to talk to my doctors abt it, but I’m wondering if anyone has any experiences with this medication, positive or negative.

I have strength trained for 2.5 years and was in very good shape, but due to a few personal issues, I had to stop going to the gym, and that led me to gain so much weight.

More than anything else, my biggest issue is my sugar addiction. It has improved to some extent, but I want to completely go cold turkey. I can't recognise the person I see in the mirror anymore. Not only has my body changed but my skin has gotten so bad I just don't know what to do. For the time being, my plan is to focus on eliminating sugar and include whole foods in my diet, start doing pilates at home and do 10k steps, and might as well try doing IF since i have done it in the past as well.

1q94jf1,Plateau.,"‼️Starters I’m going to be 24F Next Month! I’m 8+ Post Partum. ‼️

5’1

160lbs , previous 140lbs. 

I suck at explaining myself so Bear WITH ME IM SORRY. 

I’ve got my blood checked and my heart etc. everything checks out. 

Although I came back for a Hyper- thyroid. (A few months back) 

I notice I only get the symptoms when I’m extremely stressed. 

The hospital here sucks so I haven’t been able to return and before I left the doctor who checked me told me, “don’t let them hear it from me, but you can control this without the extra needed medication, through diet etc.” 

Here’s the thing. I cook, love to cook. I do (season my food) with that being said I don’t mind super healthy tasting foods or anything bland. 

I have all that down. When I eat. I eat well, stacked with nutrients. Maybe to well. I drink atleast 3 32oz of water a day. 

When I was loosing weight in the beginning it was going great.  Then I’ve been stuck at 165 for 6months and now for the last 2months stuck at 160 flat. 

Here’s where overly fed health from online has me overthinking especially for being a woman.  My body looses weight well when I allow myself to feel hungry, and I eat 1 small meal and 1 medium. And a couple snacks here and there.  Nothing extreme I loose 1-2 1bs over the span of 2weeks.  I know my body well. 

But, this is where I’m stuck, I’m scared to eat less and follow what I know my body wants or how I want to loose weight. Because of the fact of “destroying my body” I have far from an eating disorder and I allow myself to eat what I want if I do want it. 

I move moderately throughout the day when taking care of my baby. 

I will not work out until loose weight ! 

So what should I honestly do? Or what would people recommend I should follow. Etc etc etc 🥲",1768053006.0,0,7,loseit,weight_loss

1q8zml1,Discouraged by weight flactuation,"I am very short - 160cm and starting weight was 72kg in the middle of November. For the first 2-3 weeks I wasn’t weighing my food, so I don’t know if I was in deficit. I started with strength training 3x a week, speed walking, horse riding, hiking and bouldering. 

After seeing that in that time I actually gained weight instead of losing it I started using the scale for everything I eat (chewing gums included). My daily kcal intake is 1200kcal. 
I was happy to get down to below 70kg, only to see that the next week I was 70.7kg.  A week afterwards (on 22nd December) I was 67.2kg, then this Wednesday I was 66.5kg and today I weight 67.7 again. 

I feel like I am making zero progress and I truly want to just give up. I find it easy to eat those 1200kcal, so it’s not that I am overeating- I have to eat in the evening sometimes to actually reach my kcal goals. I do intermittent fasting (as it’s the easiest way for me to reach my goals) and don’t snack during the day.

1q8yef9,Boring meals,"Hi! (Sorry for formatting I’m on mobile) 

I am wanting to lose about 10 - 15 more pounds. I started at 153, got down to 139 and have hit a wall. I know it’s because I need to start actually exercising to help burn the calories I’m consuming but I also NEED to fix my diet. 

However, I am a very boring person. I like eating basic food. For example, my lunch every day is blueberries and cottage cheese. I don’t get bored of the food I’m eating. 

So, for dinners, I want simple high protein low cal meals. Like salmon and rice. Stuff like that.

1q8u824,I genuinely don’t know if I should keep going or try and maintain current weight,"So I, 24M; 5’8”, started at around 205-210lbs last spring and since then have cut to 140lbs as of today. 

Mainly I do CICO, am in the gym 3x a week doing incline walking, and light resistance training. Though admittedly, I could be more consistent with the resistance training than I currently am. 

Ideally I just want to get rid of my remaining stomach fat, though I fear about cutting down too low from where I’m currently at. I’ve already lost significant fat in my face and waist, and I know that the midsection is probably next to go. 

It’s not like my goal is to have visible abs or anything, and really my midsection has lost some fat since I’ve started losing weight, I just want things to be a little flatter than they are right now. 

I know according to a BMI calculator that the lowest I could go before being technically “underweight” is around 125, I just am worried that this might be too low. 

I guess should I try to maintain my current weight and try to be more consistent with the resistance training, or should I see if staying on the cut will deliver my intended results? ",1768018322.0,13,12,loseit,weight_loss

However, I am having some issues with nausea when I haven't eaten for a while. For the past 9 months this hasn't been an issue--only this past week as I re-entered my routine.

I wake up between 5:45-6, I drink a coffee with almond milk & sugar free syrup around 6:15-6:30. Then I leave for work around 6:50 and arrive around 7:10. At work I get settled, bop around, and usually eat between 7:45-8. I drink a protein coffee throughout the morning and eat a snack at 11ish and lunch at 1:45. I go home at 4 and eat dinner between 8-9 pm. This has been my schedule for the past 9 months (mostly, not in the summer).

However, this past week I have felt extremely sick and nauseated around 7:30. It's to the point where I don't want to eat, but I know I have to. After I eat I feel better. Then when I go home, I get so, so hungry around 5-6 pm that I feel sick and nauseated again. What is going on? Is it that I ate badly over the break and now my body is used to more sugar and calories? I was prediabetic last March but I have lost weight and cut down sugar a lot since then.

I am 2,5 months into my weight loss journey and I lost almost 13-14 kg (30 lbs) so far, so it’s pretty fast. My problem is inside of me there still is the voice telling me “we should just binge”. It’s like a little devil on my shoulder. I am doing good at ignoring it but I feel like I can’t do this forever, it costs so much willpower not to listen to it. It takes so much time to plan my meals. I have food noise constantly, I have to plan my life around my diet and I know that’s something I can do for a while but there is no way I can do it for longer than 6 months or so? I have to “control” myself around food and my diet feels like restricting “too much” even when I still eat pizza and other things, I don’t cut any food group completely, I just eat small portions. I learned to eat some chips instead of whole bag. But there is still the voice ? The monster ?in my head being like “we could just eat the whole bag and nobody can stop us”. Since 2,5 months I never gave in to the binge urge but it start to feel like it’s only matter of time where I am gonna ruin it. 

Intuitive eating doesn’t work for me as I did that for years and it resulted in me just gaining weight. 

I don’t know what to do, I am on my period rn so it’s not making any of this better, i really hope the hunger and urges will become less after a few days. I think I can reach my goal weight in 5-6 months or so and I really wanna get there. But I am so scared to not being able to continue the healthy lifestyle. I know I shouldn’t worry about it yet, and take it one step a the time.

1q8pm3y,I'm hating the Lark App,"I'm hating the Lark app. I've been using it all of 5 days and I am so tempted to just drop it.

I had lost 65 lbs in 2024, but watching my mother die in 2025 broke me. I gained back that 65lbs plus 6 more for good measure. 

I've been doing a lot of work with my therapist and social worker, and I've been reading some books on grief. I decided it was time to try to take control of my weight again. Sunday I downloaded the Lark app and went grocery shopping for some veggies. I also found a video on YouTube for a 5 minute workout. 

I was pretty proud that I was working out for 5 minutes a day. I'm huffing and puffing at the end of 5 minutes, but it's better than the nothing from before. After two days of tracking Lark started pestering me about working out more multiple times a day. It feels so discouraging because 5 minutes is the increased activity. Eventually I will do more, but I'm just getting started.

Previously I would eat 4 double cheese burgers and a large fry for lunch. That's 2240 calories and 40g saturated fat. This week for lunch I've been eating 1/2 bag of salad, 2oz smoked salmon, 3 peices of rye bread, and 1 oz brie. That's 665 calories and 10g saturated fat. Way way way better than what I was eating. But Lark will not shut the heck up about saturated fat. I'm aware that eventually I should eat even healthier, but I think a 75% decrease in saturated fat is a good start.

Or I have a box of no sugar added ice cream bars for when I need a treat. It's only 3 grams of sugar, but Lark yells at me for eating too much sugar when I have one. 

I know my current diet isn't perfect, but it's loads better than it was and I've lost 5lbs in 5 days so I'm moving in the right direction. It feels like Lark expects perfection from day 1 and I don't like it. I'm debating on dropping the Lark app and finding something different.",1768005621.0,20,10,loseit,weight_loss

1q8lza3,Is it possible to take the 'sustainable' approach or is that unrealistic when you're obese?,"Long, rambly post ahead! Hi all, I've posted in this sub before and received some super helpful advice, so with the new year upon us and me trying yet again, I thought I'd ask something that's been playing on my mind. 

For background: I've lost 50lbs previously, currently around 210 from my highest at 256. Since I lost the initial 50 (which was 2022-23), I've yoyoed mostly between 185-210. The first time I lost weight, I just cut out junk food and walked. Initially I didn't even really count calories, just cut out takeaways, treats, chocolate etc. and that was enough. The problem is that I've never managed to regain that level of discipline. I'll be disciplined for a while and then there's a birthday or Christmas or holiday or whatever and it just derails everything. 

Now, a couple months before Christmas, I decided to try and see if I could just maintain my weight and get over the binging behaviours. What's reassuring is that, when I was building in a couple of indulgent meals (takeaways, higher calorie stuff, desserts etc) per week, it massively reduced my cravings and I genuinely didn't have binge urges. It was the most incredible feeling, I genuinely can't remember feeling that much peace around food in my adult life. The problem is that it just doesn't work for weight loss. I was maintaining/probably gaining very slowly, I wasn't weighing myself as frequently, but it absolutely solved the binging issue and made me feel so much calmer. 

Anyway, I came to the conclusion that the only way I'm gonna lose weight is by just doing what I did in the beginning and cutting all junk out like I did in the beginning. That worked the first time, right? But I'm five days in and I'm so fucking miserable. I'm starving hungry even though my deficit has been extremely small (like 300 calories a day deficit) and the food noise is constant. I'm so tired and fed up. Allowing myself more food I like brought me mental peace, but it didn't allow me to lose weight. Now there's a part of me that's wondering whether the only way to actually lose a large amount of weight is just to accept the constant hunger and misery lol.

So I guess what I'm asking is, has anyone had a similar problem/situation and did anything help you to overcome it and lose weight while not worsening binge eating or just generally being miserable? I'm at a loose end here. I want and need to get this weight off, but I don't want to spend however long it takes being miserable and never enjoying the food I love. I'm also conscious that if I lose the weight, I need to somehow find a way to not regain it all at the end. Any advice here would be so gratefully received, thank you.",1767996611.0,3,21,loseit,weight_loss
1q8ktxr,"Pain Flare messing with WL, could use some nice words","Hi, 

TDLR It's been 11 months since I guess I decided to just suffer and stop eating to cope with the chronic pain I'm in to call the doctor's BS. I've lost about 23kg/50lbs and am solidly in the ""healthy zone"". 

I've been trying to get to a lower body fat %, since while I am OK for that I don't look like I am spending a lot of time working out. My body is such a source of pain, I'd like to at least feel good about something you know? 

The last 3kg has been a bear. I've had a massive pain flare (gets me up in the middle of the night, multiple times and prevents me from sitting down) that's just eating my life. Because moving helps, I do think that's buffering a bit for the emotional eating I'm back on. 

Logically, I know spending a month stalling is fine, especially around this time of year. It just hurts that I am trying to hard only to have that counterbalanced by eating. I got patient dumped by my PT earlier this week (she says I'm fine even though I haven't met the goals she established for discharge) and that's just not helped either.

I'm very happy with my overall progress and I dont plan to stop anytime soon BUT my weightloss has slowed to a crawl and I cant figure out why. I typically weigh myself once a week on Monday mornings and almost 2 weeks ago I was 276 and now Im 274. Its by no means the worst weightloss in the world but I feel like at my weight I shouldn't only be dropping 1 lb per week. 

My maintenance calories is estimated around 2200-2300 for my height and weight. I also walk 10k steps Monday-Friday which should net me around another 500 calories at least due to my current weight. That gives me 2700 calories to work with most days minimum, however, I never even touch 2000 on any day so even on weekends if I dont get a lot of steps, I never go over maintenance. Most days I land around 1400-1600 calories, always aiming for 1500. Ive worked a WFH desk job for the last 4 years which is how I got to be so heavy, Ive been completely seditary.

Been tracking my daily calorie deficit of 1640 and have found high volume foods that I enjoy eating. I also try to hit a protein goal of 90-100g a day.

Lunch: Usually leftovers from the night before. Last night was soy glazed tofu with broccoli over rice 

Dinner: I was craving something sweet so I made Madelaine Rascan’s pancake recipe and topped it with berries and sugar free maple syrup (it was SO GOOD). Normally I’ll have another meal of protein, vegetables and rice 

Dessert: high protein zero sugar chocolate yogurt pudding

1q8f4ig,Calorie deficit and exercise,"This might be a completely stupid question so no hate please 😭😭

My TDEE is 2,220 , my calorie deficit is 1700 and today I’ve eaten 1900 cals. For context I’m 165cm, 65kg and I want to be 60kg (I used to be but in the last few months have gained a bit of weight). I’m very active and do a lot of competitive sport.

Today I’ve exercised and burned about 900+ cals does this add onto my deficit like can I eat in theory 2600 cals today because I’ve exercised??

( my exercise is competitive swimming and gym workout)

If I’m looking to loose fat and build muscle is this even a good deficit?? I’m really un knowledgeable about this stuff and I’ve tried to research but there’s such a variety of info out there and some of it’s really confusing and it all contradicts each other.

Also if I’ve gone over my deficit today, should I eat 200cals less tomorrow?

I guess I’m basically asking that can you exercise out the difference when you go over your calorie deficit. 

Idk if this makes any sense but grateful for any help and advice anyone can offer!! ",1767981064.0,3,6,loseit,weight_loss
1q8ed8f,Are the Premium versions of Dieting apps worth the $,"I'm really focusing on my diet rather than exercise at the moment, and I'm curious what everyones thoughts are on paying for the premium version of different weight loss apps or calorie tracking apps like Myfitnesspal and Loseit. I'm sure some people like it because once theyre financially invested then they will take their diet more seriously, and I'm sure others like it because it does make food tracking easier with some of the features like scanning labels, etc. However, I'm a little skeptical that its worth the $80 or so each year.



Of course, everyone has their own preferences and what works for one might not work for another. But I'd love some input on if the premium version of these apps were a gamechanger.",1767979396.0,2,62,loseit,weight_loss
1q8e671,Struggling to resume my diet in the new year,"Hello everyone. So since the new year I’ve been really struggling to continue the diet I was on before Christmas. I let myself go a little over Christmas with the aim of restarting calorie counting in the new year, however so far a week in I haven’t been able to restart it. I’ve struggled with binge eating and food noise in the past, eating way over my calories for the day, and it seems I’m picking up on old habits. Before Christmas I was aiming to eat 1700 calories a day and for two months it was working (I started my weight loss journey in mid October) but with the binge eating it’s increased to probably around 2200 (170cm, current weight 70kg). I’m worried I’m going to regain the weight I’ve lost in those two months, what with the excessive eating over Christmas and binge eating/ food noise. 

Does anyone have any tips/ advice on how I can resume my diet and go back to eating 1700 calories a day again? Any advice would be appreciated. I’ve tried starting a new hobby so I’ve got less free time to think about food so as to minimise the binge eating and constant food noise, but as of yet it hasn’t been successful. I’ve also tried not buying junk/ high calorie food in the first place, but my cravings are too strong and I give in every time I go grocery shopping.

1q8dp6a,"Anyone else avoid ""healthy"" versions of food while losing weight?","I don't really care for healthy/low cal versions of common stuff. Things like kelp noodles to replace regular noodles, ""low fat"" ice cream/cheese, high protein sweets, ""cauliflower rice"" over regular rice, healthy veggie chips, spaghetti squash over regular squash, etc. You know what I mean. I have tried so many, and I just can't stand it.

 I lose weight perfectly fine eating the higher calorie/normal versions of everything. I don't skimp on meats, and I eat many servings of veggies for my meals. My milk remains whole, I use lots of spices, etc. My chocolate is dark. I use canola/olive oil regularly. I pour sauce on my fish. I make HELLA soup and stews because they're basically veggie and hydration reservoirs. My pressure cooker and I are basically married.

I feel like this helps a lot with my weight loss because I don't fear tasteless mealtimes and end up binging later, and if anything I am eating ""more"" than before since I stuff things with veggies at every turn and healthy fats from yogurt and oil, which means I am satiated for at least 6 hours at a time. I eat super chocolatey brownies and ice cream, just by the spoonful instead of bowlful. 

I eat everything at its highest calorie potential, but just less than before, and it really helps. I lost 20lb doing this and it is amazing. ",1767977961.0,135,126,loseit,weight_loss

1q8d0e6,CICO works.,"I never post here. But I read. I just wanted to share my success and hopefully some folks enjoy it.

At the start of the year, I (male) was 275 lbs. I work a physical job that would keep my weight down for a long time. But eventually I moved up into a more management and therefore sedentary position. I was overweight, drank too much alcohol, and overall knew I wasn't healthy. An ultrasound found mild fatty liver and I knew I had to make changes.

The changes I made: eat in a deficit, eat clean whole foods (Mediterranean diet), and intermittent fasting. I eat 1700-1800 calories a day, don't eat after 6pm, don't eat again until 10 am, and no longer drinker alcohol. 

I currently weigh 213.2 lbs. I feel like a completely different person. 

I give myself some grace. Every so often I eat about 2000 calories for the day. I find it actually helps recalibrate my body. And I'll have a cheat meal here and there but will still be sure to stay in my deficit. I'll also change up my fast windows. Sometimes only 12 hours, sometimes 18 hours. More often than not it's 14 hours. I also found my diet is naturally low carb. Often about 100 g a day.

1q8cuy9,Trying to lose weight but food feels like the hardest part mentally,"I know how weight loss works in theory  calories in vs calories out, moving more, eating less processed food… I get it.

But mentally? Food is exhausting. I’m 28F, 5’6”, currently 160 lbs, and I exercise 3–4 times a week, yet I constantly struggle with emotional eating.

Some days I do everything “right”  eat balanced meals, drink enough water, track my calories. But then emotions hit: stress from work, boredom at night, or just feeling lonely. Suddenly, I find myself raiding snacks without even realizing it. It’s not hunger, it’s comfort, it’s habit, it’s something else that keeps sabotaging my progress.

It’s frustrating because I know my body can handle the calories, but my mind seems to have its own rules. I’ve started wondering if weight loss isn’t really about food at all, but about understanding the mental triggers behind it.

Does anyone else feel like this? How do you cope with those mental cravings without feeling guilty or like you’ve failed?",1767976115.0,0,8,loseit,weight_loss
1q8ccq6,When Do You See It?,"Howdy y’all, I hope you all enjoyed the holidays and are killing it in the new year!

I just need a little reality check, I think, because I’m having a hard time with not actually seeing results. I have one of those fun ADHD brains that is so immediate gratification and reward-focused that staying motivated through slow progress is something I constantly battle.

I’ve been chubby since I was at least 9, and obese since high school. I (33F, 5’8) was 208 going into college, had a bit of trauma and the ol’ depresh and ate my way up to 286 by the time I finished grad school in 2024. From 2024-2025 I kind of regulated back down to a steady 260 without much effort, just less stress from school. Now, I’ve actually made a conscious effort to lose weight in the last three or so months and I’m down to 231 as of this morning.

So that’s 55 pounds down from my very highest weight, but I’m mostly thinking in terms of the 29 down from 260 as I was 260 for a long time and thats when I consciously began trying. What I’m struggling with is that I don’t see it. At. All.  Even a little bit. And I know, when you have this much weight to lose, 29 pounds is a drop in the bucket, but I thought maybe I’d have less of a double chin or maybe my clothes would fit less tight. They don’t.

I know about the paper towel effect and all that jazz but I don’t know, I told myself that if I made it to 25 pounds, thats how I’d know I could do it. I’d never stuck with it before and 25 seemed substantial so it seemed like a solid mile stone. And it’s not that I’m going to give up now or anything, it’s just that it would feel better if there were some marked difference. My next milestone is 200, but what if I feel the same way then?

1q8abzx,when did you know it was time to stop losing weight?,"after years of yo-yo diets, eating disorders, and living in extremes, i have somehow miraculously finally managed to lose weight in a slow, sustainable way that i know i can maintain for the rest of my life. for context, i eat consciously but don’t count calories (and i think a lot of you could benefit from doing the same but that’s for another post…) and i maintain a very active lifestyle (9.5k steps average, 3-4 days in the gym). with all of that, i (5’5 F) went from 179 lbs in 2024 to 139 lbs today so i’ve officially lost 40 lbs and am now starting to feel like…. okay, when do i stop?

my original goal weight was around 135, but now that i’m so close i’m starting to realize that the lean look i want would be closer to 125 probably. but then i’m also wondering if it would make more sense to stay at 135 and just get more toned? or maybe all of this is in bad faith and stems from too much comparison to fit insta baddies and most healthy bodies don’t look that good? 

so i turn to you, r/loseit: how did you know you were actually done losing weight or if you should keep going when you started getting close to your original goal weight? and is there anything you changed when you got to those lower numbers where it can get a lot tougher to lose?

1q89off,Starting over... Without the scale.,"Long story short, two years ago I went on a journey and lost over 90 lbs within a year. While I was fit and healthy, I was obsessed. I was obsessed with the scale, I'd check it multiple times a day, and be emotionally hurt by it often. I was obsessed with protein and working out- if I missed a workout or was under 140 g for a day, I'd be sick to my stomach with guilt. My every thought was consumed by my need to be physically fit. 

Fast forward a year and half, and I have gained 40 pounds back. I stopped working out consistently (more like once every two weeks), and started eating food I loved again. Cause let's face it, while grilled chicken with seasoned stir fry veggies is delicious, it's simply not a homemade raspberry danish. Which, as a baker, I have often in my house. 

But now I feel gross, slow, tired, and I am aware of how unhealthy my habits have become. Laziness is bleeding into every aspect of my life. I skip showers sometimes, or don't brush my teeth. Or I'm always running late to everything. I need to change back to a healthier lifestyle to keep me on track. 

But I'm not getting on the scale this time. I went to the Dr, and saw my weight there. I have another appointment in eight weeks, where I'll see it again. But I'm not going to obsess, or kill myself trying to meet my macros. I'm going to try to work movement into each day, and eat mostly whole foods. But I will not fixate and let it control my life until I'm burnt out again. 

I just want to say good luck to everyone. I hope you reach your goals this year, whatever they may be, safely and mindfully. Happy 2026, everyone. ❤️",1767968897.0,37,18,loseit,weight_loss
1q89jm1,i think i might be addicted to food,"EDIT: I want to clarify something. I know I’m close to being underweight but that’s not my point. I know that if I ate every time I thought about food, then I would definitely become overweight, given enough time. What I’m so tired of is having to stop myself most of the time. I think of food constantly and it’s exhausting having to remind myself to not eat every 30 minutes..

EDIT: I'm 24yr , 160cm , 50kg.

So, I'm a normal sized female. Healthy BMI of 19.5

But lately I've been thinking about food CONSTANTLY. Even when I'm not remotely hungry. It's 1pm right now and I've already eaten over 1000kcal. Which is quite substantial for a girl my size.

I feel so fucking jealous of those girls that *fOrGEt To EaT uNTiL tHeYre aBOut To pASs OuT.* Like, fuck off. The other night i was lying in bed and the thing I was most excited about for the next day was having lunch.

When I wake up in the morning I think about food, when I'm sitting at my desk (i work from home) i think about food and what snack I could eat. It's constantly in my brain and I'm so tired of it.

I know I'm not fat, but I'm scared that I'm going to become it. And yes, I know I could just NOT EAT and refrain from the urge. But how the fuck do I just STOP THINKING ABOUT FOOD.

I guess working from home doesn't help, because when I'm bored and food is nearby I just get off my chair and open the fridge.

I don't know why I've become like this.. My boyfriend is the complete opposite of me. He doesn't have breakfast most of the time. If he starts feeling full while eating a meal he'll slow down or just stop eating, like any normal human being. But not me, no. I keep eating even if I'm about to explode. Maybe I'm addicted to the taste? I don't fucking know.

I can't even get Ozempic to reduce food noise because I'm not heavy enough.

My apple fitness app says I’m burning roughly 3400 calories a day.

On January 1st, I was 177lbs. (I’m 5’7) and today I’m 176. How is it possible I’ve lost less than a pound?

1q88vxy,Reassurance on Calorie Maintenance,"Hello,

I know similar posts have probably been made hundreds of times but I’m just looking for a bit of reassurance on my current plan from people who know more about handling caloric deficits than me.

For context I’m a 22 year old male, 82kg 5’11. Id consider myself fairly muscular, max bench press is 135kg and can do 12 wide grip pull-ups (i know its probably not entirely relevant but I’m just not sure how much muscle mass affects weight loss).

My goal over the next 5-6 months is to cut down to about 76-77 kg, while maintaining as much muscle as possible. I’ve used maintenance calculators online but I’m just not entirely sure what category I fit into. I work an office job which requires 0 physical activity, but since i started the cut, which was last week, I’ve been aiming for 10k steps a day. I also weight train 4-5 times per week and incline walk 30 minutes per day at 12% incline 3mph, these steps are separate to the 10k walked per day. 

I have asked ChatGPT for help and it says that 2.1-2.2k calories per day is too aggressive of a deficit for me, is this accurate at all? I’ve read a lot on here that I shouldn’t be counting exercise calories so I am not sure how legitimate these claims are as I don’t fully trust ChatGPTs opinion on the matter. It says to aim for 2.3 at least, which I plan on doing but I would just like to know if thats too many calories if I am aiming for a 500 cal deficit per day.

1q88nu4,The Mental Aspect of All of This,"Hey! long time listener, first time caller.

This is my first time actually committing to something to try to lose weight. It’s gotten to the point that I feel so disgusted and ashamed when I see photos of myself. 

I decided that January 1st I was going to just go hard into CICO and start losing weight. (We’re also taking my kids to WDW in July and I want to not be as disgusting as I am so that I can move around the parks in 100 degree heat chasing around 3 small children more easily).

The thing I’m finding most difficult is the mental aspect (it probably doesn’t help that I also am going for dry January at the same time as starting a calorie deficit.) But mentally this is rough.

There’s so many time that I am not realizing I would turn to a sweet treat. Sad? Chocolate. Minor inconvenience? Latte from Starbucks. Weird social interaction that has me questioning my well being? Plate of midnight nachos.

I tied all of the negative points of my day to food and now I don’t have that. And it’s January, so I can’t go outside and touch some grass. 

I guess I’m just curious what you all do to replace those little rewards you once gave yourself especially when sunshine and nature is limited.

It’s been noticeable and I love getting compliments and people asking what I’m doing to get there. But it’s created a beast in me I think, where I’m terrified to eat out and drink alcohol, too. 

I have plans to get tacos and margs with friends tonight and I’m so scared about the scale. It’s bounced around the past two months honestly, oscillating between 183-187. Can’t seem to get under 183. I traveled for several weeks not at my own place during large parts ofthose months, and I was under some stress, so it makes sense. 

But now I’m back at my house the past few days, and I’m at 185.0 and I just want to cancel all my plans. I cried so much last night because I was so hungry and I’m still seeming to plateau/oscillate. I go to the gym 5x a week, strength training 4x and cardio after almost every lift and have a designated cardio day (I mainly do incline treadmill and stairmaster). I tried to do this as much as I could while traveling, and now that I’m back I’m trying to do it again.

I want to lose 20lbs in 10 weeks for a trip. (Bought all my swim trunks when I was around 180-185ish) 

I work construction and eat pretty healthy foods. My issue is sauces, chilaquiles for breakfast and milk/sugar in my coffee.

By switching to black coffee, just eggs for breakfast with hot sausage and also hot sauce/low cal sauce for other stuff I’m able to cut out close 2000cals a day but pretty much only sacrificing sugary drinks and sauces. 

I’ve started biking 25kms a week as well on my smart trainer. Online says 1-2lbs a week is healthy but I figure I’ll be closer to 3-4lbs a week. I was 175lbs in good shape from the gym 3 years ago.

Girlfriend is in medical school and doesn’t have an answer for me so I figured I’d have to trust Reddit for advice.

1q85tzs,Quitters Day,"The definition of Quitters Day is: ”The second Friday in January has come to be known as Quitter's Day. Less than two weeks into the new year, this is where many people give up on their New Year's resolutions.”

If your New Year’s resolution is to lose weight, this is the time to keep going.

The early weeks of change are uncomfortable for a reason. Your body is adjusting, your mind is learning new habits, and nothing feels automatic yet. Progress can feel invisible, which makes it easy to question whether the effort is worth it. It is. This phase is where foundations are built, even if you cannot see them yet.

Weight loss is not about being perfect or staying motivated every day. It is about consistency over time. A few imperfect meals or missed workouts do not erase progress. Quitting does. The people who succeed are not the ones who never struggle, but the ones who keep showing up despite the struggle.

Your brain prefers familiar routines, even unhealthy ones. When you change how you eat or move, resistance is normal. Cravings, doubt, and low energy do not mean something is wrong. They mean your habits are being challenged and reshaped.

Remember why you started. Better health, more energy, improved confidence, or a better quality of life. Those reasons still matter today. The benefits of better health are long term, and they are built through small, repeated choices.

Good luck!",1767958007.0,541,52,loseit,weight_loss
1q855px,"Dating after weightloss, any advice? Feeling lost","Hello! Just wanted to share my experience with weightloss and dating, hopefully get some advice from someone that has gone through sometimes similar.

Some backstory
Im a male, 32 years old and 191cm tall (6ft3). Over the course of 1.5 years Ive lost about 29kg (64lbs). Went from 117kg to 88kg(194lbs). Currently content with my weight, but om working on losing some more, slowly. Before losing weight i always felt really ugly, discusting and unwanted. I never got any attention from the opposite sex. Yes, large part because of my confidence. But at the time it felt like someone being attracted to me was impossible. 

Dating
Been using dating apps since mid september last year. Currently sitting on 60 matches. Most conversations fizzle out. I've gone on dates with 5 different women, one of them I rejected after the first date because i didnt feel anything romantic. The other 4 we went on 3 dates each. So a total of 13 dates. We talk, we laugh, we have fun. I give compliments. Nothing sexual happened, just hugging and holding hands. Which i initiate. Somehow it always ends with them telling me they just want to be friends. Which i of course accept. It just hurts, especially my last interest. We texted everyday (20-30 messages) for 2 months. We would even talk on the phone for 2-5 hours a couple of times a week.

Im just exhausted, i spend so much energy trying to get a connection. Just when i get hopefully and start to feel something, its suddenly over. And it is VERY sudden. The though of doing it all over again just sucks. Ive never had a long term partner before, only a few one night stands from drinking hookups. Its not their fault, i realise im the problem. I just dont know what to do. Im fit, i feel like i look good. I just dont know how to interact and take it further because im so used to feeling unwanted and unattractive. 

Sorry for the long post, just looking for some advice because im hurting right now, and i feel a bit lost. A large motivator for my weightloss was to find love, but its just so draining.

Has anyone experienced something similar?",1767955688.0,2,19,loseit,weight_loss

1q7zyyv,Lost weight after not exercising for a week. Should I start exercising again?,"Hi! I’m 19, 150cm and 63.9kg, thought a lot of it is muscle due to almost a decade of figure skating. I’m also 4 months on testosterone (I’m trans) 

I started trying to lose weight about a month ago, when I was 65kg. I started by lowering my caloric intake to around 1300 (my sedentary TDEE is 1500) and burning about 600-800 calories by figure skating three times a week for two hours. 

Even with the cal deficit and the exercise, I didn’t lose weight. That is, until I didn’t skate for a week. I also kept my intake the same. But today, I stepped on the scale and finally lost a little. From 64.9kg to 63.9kg! 

So I’m wondering if I should start skating again, or if that will make me gain/maintain. I know that I’ve been counting my calories more or less accurately, and anything I ate would have been made up for with the exercise anyway, so I’m really at a loss. 

Advice would be appreciated! ",1767937060.0,0,6,loseit,weight_loss
1q7zjgj,Tips on how to stop binging,Hiya! I’ve lost around 15kg this past year and I need to lose a couple more kgs before I’m at my goal weight. However I’m in uni right now and it’s been getting harder and harder to stop binging let alone eating healthy like I used to. I’ve been able to maintain my weight but if I continue like this I might start gaining back the weight I lost. I noticed i dont binge throughout the day. I eat a healthy amount when I feel hungry and I can stop when I’m full. It’s at night time when I’m home from school that I can’t stop myself. Im not even hungry. I just feel bored or see something and all of a sudden I find myself eating until I’m so full my tummy hurts.

1q7z18v,I realized I can fit into a smaller clothing size today!,"Hey all! I'm 26F, 5'1"", and started out around 200-180lbs 3 years ago. It's been a very long, rocky ride full of ups and downs, but today I tried on a small cause I was sent the wrong size and... it fit?? I was kinda confused cause I've been fitting into mediums for a while, but I realized it fit better than they did, more flattering and not so baggy. 

I took my measurements cause I haven't done that in a while, referenced a sizing chart and realized I'm riiight on the cusp of being firmly a small, save for the waist being one inch higher than the others. 

I'm not at my GW yet (120lbs), currently 135lbs, but it was so very exciting to me. At the start, I was a L/XL and this is like... insane to me. I look at old pics a lot and sometimes don't see much of a difference, but this really felt like the first ""I'm almost there"" moment for me. At the start, I couldn't fit into this beautiful dress that now is too baggy on me (I'll see if I can tailor it a bit) I don't think I've ever been anything but a medium/large since I became a teen.

My goal isn't to just fit into smaller clothes, but it's so encouraging, a non-scale reminder that it *is* working. Finally being consistent about eating healthy/exercising has been such a massive improvement on my physical, mental and emotional health these past few years, going from absolutely hating myself to being happy when I wake up and treating my body like I care about it. Not starving myself, not exercising as a punishment, but nourishing myself and making myself stronger little by little.

But yeah, just sharing a win! ❤️",1767934227.0,54,3,loseit,weight_loss

**Current stats:** *147.7lbs, 29.5 inch waist*

**Starting stats:** *134.6lbs, 26 inch waist*

**25F, 5'4**

Image on **left** is my starting photos in the end of *Oct. 2025*. The **right** is today (*after a full day of eating*)

I've been going to the gym trying to do a recomp but I feel like I just did negative progress?

I don't see much of a positive differences besides a SLIGHTLY perkier booty than when I started, but otherwise *everything is bigger in a fat-gain way...not a muscle-gain way.*

**Exercise:**

I go to the gym 4 days a week with 1 upper, 2 lower, and 1 full body day...all have 10-30 minutes of light cardio at the end depending on if I feel well with my POTS. **(All lift sessions include multiple compound lifts and multiple isolation lifts each session. The weight I'm able to lift has gone up over the months too)**. I usually stick to machines for better form since I'm still relatively new.

**Food:**

*I will say, the holidays threw me off track. I ""gained"" 6 lbs in the week of  Xmas and haven't been able to get it to go away. I definitely ate more/had more sweets than what I was sticking to... and now its like I have to accumulate my tastebuds again to less sweets and less calorie crazy, yummy foods to be okay again with protein powder and less sugary/yummy foods for my goals - when before the holidays I was doing SO good.*

2 eggs, 2 bacon, cottage cheese, half a banana for breakfast. Protein and either rice or a sweet potato for lunch with either fruit or veg. Protein, rice and veggies for dinner. Then protein filled snacks like a protein bar, protein shake, protein pudding, etc. One between lunch and dinner, one after dinner.

I eat 1750-1850 calories with 130-145g protein daily. Even on rest days (rest days are sometimes slightly lower cal tho).

So.... **BEFORE** the holidays, I didn't really binge or crave chocolates/sweets much at the end of my day. But now I often give into chocolates before bed which destroy by calories for the day. That mixed with the ""6lbs gained"" from the holidays... now I'm here :/

Any advice? I know a body is made in the kitchen, and I truly do eat well all day long until stupid bedtime with chocolates lately... I know I'm stressed because a new semester is starting in a few days, and my period is 100% about to start too. But I can't help but feel so discouraged because I look worse than when I started :/",1767930827.0,23,66,loseit,weight_loss
1q7wopk,My breaking point,"I think my breaking point with my weight last year was when I went to Walmart to buy a belt and pants.

In the past three years I’ve gained weight rapidly. I went from the 170’s all the way back up to 250 in May of last year. So I basically gained almost 80 pounds in less than two years from binge eating due to trauma.

So anyways, I went to Walmart and I was looking for pants when I realized that a size 22w was too small on me again! I almost couldn’t find pants to wear. Then I went to find a belt and NONE of the women’s belts fit around my waist.

My friend suggested I look in the men’s section. When I got to the men’s section I was trying them on and none of them fit around my waist either 😭

I finally found 2 pairs of 24w jeans and the largest men’s belt that barely fits around my waist.

This made me feel so embarrassed and discouraged. I cannot believe I’ve gotten to this point again after losing a significant amount of weight just 3-4 years ago. 3 years ago I weighed in the 170’s after losing almost 90 pounds in a year and a half. I remember my pants were falling off of me. I was on my way to a healthy weight and only had 40 or so more pounds left to lose.

Now I’m back to where I started again…

I’m proud to say I lost 15 pounds last year and that for the past 5 days or so I’ve managed to eat in a calorie deficit successfully.

I want to lose at least 40-50 pounds this year (more would be great but if that doesn’t happen 40-50 is a great start!)",1767927559.0,114,18,loseit,weight_loss

1q7vqdp,Drinking more water is helping me not snack constantly and idk why,"F 5'6"" SW: 185 CW: 178 GW: 145

One of my goals for losing weight this year was to stop snacking so much between meals bc thats where most of my extra calories come from

Ive been tracking everything in mfp and doing okay but kept having these moments where i'd feel absolutely starving at like 3pm even though I ate a good lunch then I’d drink water and suddenly the hunger would disappear which seemed weird

I realized maybe I'm just thirsty or smth most of the time and my brain interprets it as hunger?? Ive been actually tracking my water with waterminder and on days where I hit 2,5-3L I barely get those fake hunger signals and its so much easier to stick to my calorie goal

Its only been like 3 weeks but already down 2 more pounds just from not snacking when I'm actually just thirsty. It feels like such a simple fix i wish I’d figured it out sooner",1767925023.0,43,8,loseit,weight_loss
1q7vkax,Can I consume most my calories at 6-8PM?,"So, basically, I'm 162 centimeters (5'3 feet) 83.5 kilograms (184 pounds). I eat 1200-1500 calories per day. 1200 on days when I don't move at all, and 1500 on days when I do go for my usual walk or two. If I don't go for my walk, I burn 1900 calories per day, and if I do go for my usual two one-hour-long walks per day, I think I burn around 2500 calories, if my step-counting app is correct. 

The good thing is that I barely get any cravings at all until around 6PM. Then, at from approximately 6 to 8:30 PM I get the worst, most voracious hunger known to man. Yes, this happens even if I eat enough and properly with lots of protein and fiber during the day to keep me full. I still get those evening cravings. 

So, I have decided to leave 1000 out of my daily 1200-1500 calories until the evening, so I can satisfy that hunger (because I really can't just ignore it, I will end up overeating lots if I try to ignore it). My question is, does it matter? Will my weight-loss progress slow down at all because of this? Or is *when* I consume my daily calories completely irrelevant, as long as I'm in a calorie deficit? If you're wondering if I don't feel tired during the day since I leave most of my calories for the evening, I do not. I feel great. Way better than before.",1767924580.0,1,5,loseit,weight_loss
1q7vbpm,How tracking made my weight loss journey actually sustainable,"Hey everyone! Figured I’d share something that’s really changed how I approach weight loss. I’ve been working with an online program through Fo⁤und for a few months now. They combine GLP-1 meds with a metabolic health plan, it’s been a total shift in how I manage progress. Before this, I’d go through the whole cycle of calorie tracking for a few weeks, getting burned out, then falling off, rinse and repeat. What’s made the biggest difference for me lately is tracking in a way that feels less obsessive and more like data collection, if that makes sense. Fo⁤und has an AI coach (in addition to real clinicians) and a pretty good app that helps me log meals, workout sessions, and even mood patterns. It’s not just about the number on the scale anymore. I started paying attention to how certain foods affect my energy or sleep and that’s helped me figure out patterns I never noticed before. I think having accountability without feeling judged has been key. The AI feedback thing sounds cheesy, but it’s been decent at giving me nudges when I start slipping into old habits. I’ve learned that consistency > perfection, which was something I definitely used to struggle with.  I’m curious how others here handle tracking long-term. Do you all use apps, spreadsheets, or just intuitive eating?

1q7rqby,Not seeing results,"Okay so bit of a weird situation really. 

I’m currently sitting at about 99-101kg and my goal is about 88-90kg but nothing seems to work. 

I’m currently working as a postie so I’m walking about 10 miles a day plus about 100 staircases. I also go to the gym 4x a week for at least an hour. 

I also track my calories and protein intake. I struggle to hit the 180g mark of protein so I aim for 150g minimum and that does seem to work on the days I struggle to hit 180g. 

I don’t eat takeaway much if at all. I allow myself one cheat meal per week. Most days I’m aiming for about 2000 calories and add in slightly more carbs than I would if not a working as a postie based on how much cardio I do. 

I was initially at about 107kg and dropping that was relatively easy but now nothing is changing. I’ve been stuck here for about 6 weeks and absolutely nothing is changing. Can someone please help! 

I’m currently looking into alternate meal ideas that could maybe help but I really don’t know what’s going with my body at this point. People have mentioned that my metabolism may have dramatically slowed down. But still not sure how I’d sort that out without just eating bigger portions. Which I did at one point to try sort it out but then put another 2kg back on. 

I really don’t understand what I’m doing wrong. 
please help wherever possible and all

1q7qpxn,"Lost 10kg and almost nobody noticed, is this a height thing?","I’ve lost about 10 kilos recently, which is roughly 22 pounds, and what’s strange is that most people haven’t even noticed. It’s a pretty significant amount to me, but externally it seems to have flown under the radar.

For context, I’m 173 cm, so around 5’8”. 24F. Went from 185 lbs to 163 but still continuing the journey cause i am still overweight by BMI standards. Would like to achieve my former weight which was 150 lbs. I’ve never really considered myself tall, but apparently that matters more than I realised. What’s even weirder is that when I was gaining the weight in the first place, almost nobody noticed either. Literally the only person who clocked it was my mum. I was still fitting into the same clothes for the most part, except for evening gowns, and even then it wasn’t super obvious to others.

What messed with my head a bit is that I noticed the weight gain quite late myself. Then I started losing it, and again, no one really noticed. It feels odd because I’m very aware of the change, but socially it’s like nothing happened.

I’m starting to think this is a tall-person thing, or at least a longer-limbs thing, where weight distributes in a way that makes changes less visible. I’ve seen other people mention similar experiences, where fairly big fluctuations just don’t register to others.

Has anyone else experienced this? Especially people who aren’t extremely tall but maybe tall enough for weight to spread out more evenly.",1767912466.0,163,175,loseit,weight_loss

Then I started losing hair and struggling mentally so I ended up stopping the gym and I realised it’s probably because my calories were at 1000 ish and I was training 5 days a week I burnt out.

Around 4 months ago I started with a new PT and her goal was to raise my calories and gain muscle. I’ve slowly went from 1500-1850 calories 150ish protein a day with 3/4 training days. My strength has really jumped the past month and I’m feeling strong but im really struggling with the mental side. I feel like I look huge. I feel fatter and lumpier and even though I can see muscle shape and I have lost around 1 inch on my waist and gained 1 on each leg and glutes I know it’s muscle but mentally it’s really hard.

1q7pxu0,I dont know what im doing wrong.,"Hi everyone I’m looking for some advice, I’m trying desperately to loose weight but for some reason I’m not. Im 5’3 and at the beginning of this i was 63.7kg but now I’m 68.5 kg. I haven’t been going to they gym mostly because I’m too poor for the membership but I’ve been going out on really long walks (1hr-3hrs) at least 3-4 times a week AND I’m in a calorie deficit (1200cal atm) but for some reason I’m gaining?? I honestly don’t know what else I’m meant to do I’ve cut out sugar, increased my protein and vegetables starting cooking healthier but nothing seems to work and im really really struggling. Anyone who might be able to help me figure out whats going on?

Edit: okay so I started this weight loss journey about 4-5 weeks before Christmas and originally I was on 1400 cal I realised that was too high and the week before Christmas I went down to 1200. (I used a website to figure out my deficit but later found out that was incorrect and went lower)

Since starting this, I’ve also experienced other issues like and eczema flareup (I literally haven’t had eczema since I was about 10)

All around fatigue and my hair and nails has really taken a hit for some reason (they’re really brittle and break quite easily)

I’m using Yazio to track my calories and yes, I’m weighing things like cooking oil, seasonings, sauces etc.

I genuinely don’t know what else to do. I really feel like I’m failing and I’m feeling completely dejected. cutting out sugar has made me miserable but I know if I have it in the house I’ll end up binging on it, I’ve tried different “high protein” “low fat” substitutes, but all of them seem to really upset my stomach so I’ve had to cut out pretty much everything i used to enjoy, I’m eating TINY portions so I’m always hungry and i don’t know what I’m doing wrong",1767910639.0,0,32,loseit,weight_loss

1q7oa2g,"I hear starting a more intense exercise regimen leads to temporary water retention/weight gain, which eventually comes off in what has been dubbed the ""whoosh"" effect. Can anyone share their experiences with this? I think I'm going through it right now and it's messing with my head.","I've lost 12 lbs the past few weeks by eating 1200 calories. I was losing 1-1.25 lbs/week like clockwork. That led me to believe I'd been in a 500-600 calorie daily deficit, so my maintenance calories are roughly 1700-1800 calories.

I got down to 120 lbs a couple weeks ago and decided it was time to start exercising and increasing my calories. My plan is to increase my daily calories by 100 every two weeks. So the past two weeks I have been eating 1300 calories, which should still be a 400-500 calorie deficit. But I've gained 3 lbs over the past two weeks. My jeans are tighter.

For the past two weeks I went from no exercise to (what I thought) was a very reasonable beginner exercise routine. I'm doing daily mitt work (boxing) with my SO. In addition to that I am doing a Caroline Girvan circuit training dumbbell routine twice a week. These sessions are high intensity but only 20 minutes in duration so I didn't think it would be ""too much.""

Is this amount of exercise enough to cause water retention/inflammation? I have a lot of muscle soreness. And I think a mild shoulder injury.

The rational part of my brain knows I haven't gained 3 lbs of fat from eating 1300 calories. But I'm still like WTFFFF! Sticking to my plan, I'm due to increase my calories again to 1400 tomorrow. I have some trepidation now because I've gained weight. I was so sure my maintenance is 1700-1800, but now I'm not so sure.

Can anyone share their experience with this phenomenon? How long did it take after you started exercising for everything to equalize? The ""whoosh,"" so to speak.

Thanks!

1q7mik2,"I lost 100 pounds in 8 months and I feel better than I have in years, I wanted to share my experience in case anyone else is struggling","Apologies for the long post incoming, but I want to give the appropriate context. Just for clarification, I am currently 29 years old (about to turn 30), 6’4, 325 pounds (down from 425). 

I’ve struggled with weight my entire life, and I’ve been at most weight stages (from lean and athletic to morbidly obese), and I understand the struggle very well.

My latest bout of weight gain started around 2022, not get to much into it but a relationship I had been in for years fall apart and it was the start of me not caring about myself. I don’t want to blame it all on that, I’ve had a bad relationship with food and struggled with depression and anxiety forever, but I think that was just the straw that broke the camel’s back. Fast forward to 2024 and I was deep in depression and putting on weight like crazy. I was doing nothing except drinking, vaping, snacking and eating fast food. It got so bad where I was only eating fast food for about 2 months straight. 

Every facet of my life had gotten demonstrably worse. My joints hurt, my body felt awful, I was breaking out, losing hair, getting 3-5 hours of sleep a night, libido and sexual performance were nonexistent, constant panic attacks, I was avoiding any and all social contact, and I constantly thought about death and felt like I would be off dead (my therapist later described me as ‘passively suicidal’).

Mid 2024 I was missing work coming in late, and my manager brought me in to a private room and asked me is everything was okay. He talked to me about how he was worried about and at that moment I realized I needed to change because it must’ve been incredibly obvious if he was noticing. 

I’m lucky enough that my health insurance covers mental healthcare, so I started attending therapy and got put on antidepressants. We worked through a lot of past trauma and understanding why I was addicted to these destructive habits and coping mechanisms, but admittedly I was kinda just going through the motions and I didn’t take it too seriously to start with.

Come mid November 2024, my father (who is diabetic) has a heart attack. This was incredibly hard on my family, especially my mother and sister, and my mom sat down with me and told me she was really worried about me as well. I promised my mom at the new year I would go see a doctor and get a health exam. 

January 2025 I was at a very low point (arguably my lowest), I was deep in debt and then come to find out I was under investigation at work for missing and being late to work so much the year before (this would get resolved a month later but I was put on probation for 9 months). I felt like I was at the end of my rope, and I didn’t know what to do. Luckily my mom was there for and helped me stay strong. 

I kept my promise and got a health exam from my doctor. At this point I was 416 pounds and I found out I was pre-diabetic… This was very devastating to me as diabetes has killed multiple people in my family, and I decided I finally need to start seriously trying to change. 

The first few months were rough. I tried hiring a personal trainer and although I liked the guy I just did not enjoy the experience (I’ve always worked better on my own). I also fell on and off the wagon and I actually put on 9 more pounds for a peak weight of 425. 

Come June, I had gone to the dentist and they took my blood pressure while there. They took it multiple times with different devices and I asked what was wrong, and they informed me that my “blood pressure was way too high for someone my age”. 

This was very scary to me and the final straw. I made the decision to start going to the gym the very next day. I signed up for the one down the road from me (a Gold’s). This wasn’t too hard of a choice since I had always enjoyed lifting weights (I was fairly lean and athletic in high school/college), however the night before I was so nervous and anxiety ridden about going that I had a panic attack and wandered around my neighborhood for 2-3 hours starting at midnight trying to calm myself down. I got maybe 2 hours of sleep that night, but I still went the next day.

I was very nervous but the gym staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating, and I realized people weren’t judging me. I started going 3-4 days a week and eating better, but I realized that my diet needed some serious work. Luckily I found out my health insurance also fully covers a nutritionist, so I started seeing them and I’ll be honest, I think this is the thing that really changed my results.

The nutritionist helped me form a nutrition plan and get my calories and macros in check, as well as explaining to me the importance of a calorie deficit and protein intake, and this is when the weight really started to melt off for me.  Just so we’re clear, I don’t believe a nutritionist is necessary for weight loss at all, as most of the stuff they taught me is just freely available online, but since it was fully covered by my insurance I thought why not. 

I also started seriously strength training and doing 30-40 minutes of light cardio (walking around my neighborhood or work office), and it felt like a light switch flipped in me internally.

It wasn’t an easy or linear process by any means, I learned motivation is the most fleeting of fuels for making a lifestyle change, and that weight/strength fluctuations in the short term are completely normal, but I just kept going and consistent, sticking to training and nutrition plans. 

Fast forward to today; I’m 100 pounds lighter, I’m no longer pre-diabetic, and I feel more hopeful and ambitious than I have in years. I knew something had changed when I no longer fear public outings or seeing my reflection. I could finally dress for fashion as opposed to comfort. My pain is almost completely gone, my sleep is much better, and I look better than I have in years. No panic attacks in months, and no alcohol in half a year.

This time last year I was wondering if I would be better off dead, now I finally feel like I can do anything. I’ve still got a long way to go to reach my goal weight, but it’s never felt more possible.

I do recognize how privileged I am to have my mom and friends as a support structure, and that my health insurance covered the therapies I needed, but I just want you to know change is possible. 

If you have any specific questions about nutrition, training methods, how to stay consistent, etc., I’ll try to answer them in the comments.

In the meantime stay strong guys, it’s absolutely possible to change, you guys got this.

1q7m2cn,Pushing Through Self Doubt.,"I wanted to share some of the unexpected struggles I’ve faced during my weight‑loss journey, and how the brain can try to sabotage you even when things are actually going really well. I’ve been working on losing weight for six months now, and the phases I’ve gone through have been… interesting. The mental battles show up when you least expect them.

**Background**

I’m a 32 year old guy, 185 cm tall. Over the last 12 years, my weight went from 100 kg all the way up to 163.7 kg. I knew I was getting bigger, but I kept ignoring it and telling myself I’d “fix it when I reach X weight,” then moving the goalpost every time. I had lost weight before with unsustainable methods like Herbalife, but I always regained it.

**Self‑Doubt**

Every single day, my brain tells me what I’m doing isn’t working and that I should just quit. It reminds me that I’ve tried before and failed. But the truth is, this is the furthest I’ve ever gotten. I’m in the best shape of my life, even though I’m still overweight. I’m currently 143 kg, down from 163.7 kg.

**The “Failing” Moments**

After being on a 1k calorie deficit for a long time, my brain absolutely freaks out when I eat something that isn’t macro friendly. If I have one burger, I feel like I’ve ruined everything and gained all the weight back instantly. I know this mindset isn’t healthy, but right now it’s something I’m aware of and working through.

**Mental Fights**

I learned the hard way that I’m not a robot. Taking a refeed phase is necessary for me. At one point, I became extremely emotional, had mood swings, and even cried over not getting the food I wanted. That was probably the closest I’ve come to giving up. I train four times a week doing powerlifting while on a high deficit, and I guess my hormones just took a hit.

**The Urge to Bulk**

Powerlifting on 2,350 calories a day can be draining. Sometimes I catch myself thinking, “Maybe I should just bulk.” But then I remember I’m still at 44% body fat (down from over 50%). Why my brain thinks bulking at this stage is a good idea is beyond me.

**Lessons Learned**

Keep pushing. It’s okay to take planned breaks to maintain, “*planned”* being the key word. After getting advice here and talking with my trainer, we picked a date and duration for a break well in advance. When the time came, I was ready. It’s way too easy to say, “I’ll take a week off starting tomorrow,” and then never start again. Having it scheduled made all the difference.

These are just some of the hurdles I’ve run into while being in a deficit. I’d love to hear about the unexpected challenges you’ve faced during your own weight‑loss journeys.

1q7khiv,Worry to start,"13 years ago I went from about 220 lb to 160. The next year I got pregnant and gained most of it back.

Now I am 45 and I'm a single mom and I recently gained about 15lb over a month and decided I finally need to get it together to lose the weight. 

I started calorie counting and over a few weeks lost about 10 lb but I started getting seriously light-headed after eating and I almost passed out and kind of freaked out and abandoned my plan. Since then I've gained even more weight and I'm kind of freaking out because my body is having all these other issues now and I'm also just pretty overwhelmed with life stuff and it's been really difficult for me to plan my meals ahead like I did previously. I feel like I have no attention span and find that on days when I am trying to watch my diet I end up not eating until the afternoon because I don't have groceries or Im too busy or anxious to cook or my kitchen isn't clean or the dishes aren't done or I just can't see myself eating what I had planned to eat, and then I get shaky and dizzy and desperate and just eat whatever. I have gotten prepared salads that I have been eating for breakfast everyday but it's to the point where I just don't want to eat them anymore.  I'm basically not eating carby food at all until sometimes in the evening and that seems to have fixed the passing out feeling.

I feel like my life is out of control. I was regularly exercising for a while and I injured my foot probably because I've gained a lot of weight so fast that my arch just failed. But that kept me off my feet for a good month.  Now I just get panicky trying to make a plan again and trying to exercise indoors has been extremely difficult because I get distracted, time passes, and then my kids are at home and I can't leave my son alone due to his disability and I'm constantly interrupted.  

Everything is way harder this time but it feels like it's extremely urgent now. I worry every day that I'm going to die young and my son will have noone.  I'm 235lb now and 5'1 but it's not like I have any illness and I can get around fine so I don't know why I'm so obsessed and frightened when it's something that I absolutely could just deal with. I already walk 40 minutes a day most of the time because I walk my kid to school 10 minutes back and forth twice a day, so it's not like I'm completely sedentary either.  

I guess you could say that I've already begun to do this, but my attempt so far have been such a disorganized fruitless inconsistent mess that I feel like I haven't really. I can't really afford a counsellor or a gym membership or helper and I don't really have any family or friends either to help with the logistics.  So I'm not sure if this is a vent or a cry for help. Do any of you have suggestions for how to feel less scared and doomed? Or to get it together and finally just power through the difficulties?

Our kids are not at all because besides sweet tea, we've been very intentional about them eating healthy and whole foods. My husband and I have definitely realized this week that you have to have better portion control even with homemade meals using almost exclusively whole foods. 

This week we've had nothing but water and milk for the kids. My husband and I have had nothing but water, except my husband has fit in a glass of milk into his macros a few times this week.

And now the children ask for water. It's always been a fight to get them to drink water because they have always wanted tea or juice or milk, but usually tea. Turns out not having it in the house at all eliminates the bartering we've had to do in the past because eventually they get thirsty enough. Seems simple enough.

I guess this is where your brain comes up with excuses. I believe that because the children's food diet has been so healthy that I just overlooked the liquid sugar that they were having daily. That we were having daily. And now I can't unsee it. Can't go back after this. My husband can't either.

Since I already cook almost 100% of our meals from scratch, it hasn't been too big of a deal to incorporate the kitchen scale and weighing everything for husband and I out in grams. What I've done this week is portion out our individual servings before cooking and then cooking the food for the kids and then our portions individually. It barely takes any extra time, and only a few extra dishes (and isn't that what a dishwasher is for?). I already had a kitchen scale for making homemade bread, so I'm very familiar with its use. My husband has started using it as well to make sauces.

The first two days I would say were the biggest mental game so far. It sounds silly, but I've always had a problem drinking water. It made me nauseous. I got better at drinking it in my most recent pregnancy, but that first glass always made my stomach turn. I guess not drinking anything else this week has made a big change, because I easily downed 32oz of water before breakfast this morning. Not because I HAD to (most the time I try to get 16oz in before breakfast), but because I felt like that was what my body needed. I've gone from very little water daily last week to achieving 80oz with great difficulty earlier this week to now easily clearing 120oz daily without even feeling like I'm trying. I always have a glass of water within reach and as soon as it empties, I just fill it up again.

Having not just a supportive partner but someone who is JUST as invested as I am in our long-term health has made this SO much easier. It also helps that besides liquid sugar and portion control, we've already been eating very nutritiously. My husband casually lost 20 pounds this past year because of our diet change (very little ultra-processed foods and focusing on whole foods), and I dropped 16 pounds since our baby was born in July. We've also never been alcohol drinkers, so that is not a lifestyle change we have had to make.

Our motivation for weight loss is not being because of how we look (though that is a nice side effect). Ultimately, we want to age well. My paternal grandparents are very overweight and have had numerous health problems. Though not diabetic, they have really struggled. Health issues are worsened by their weight and recovery after surgery has been much more difficult due to their weight. They have very limited mobility now.

Back problems also run in that side of the family no matter the person's size, and I've struggled with back pain since I was a fit teenager. Unfortunately even my siblings who are at healthy weights deal with back pain. I've dealt with chronic back pain my entire adult life. My father, his sister, his parents, and most of his uncles have all had back surgery. Even my great-grandfather had intense back issues that led to his early retirement. My dad is overweight and has yo-yo dieted my entire life. As he's gotten older, I've seen his weight take a toll on him and his various recoveries.

I can't ignore the fact that even when I am at a healthy BMI that I will likely need back surgery. However, I keep asking myself what I want my recovery to look like. I want to give myself the easiest recovery I can. Beyond that, my husband and I want to spend as much time together healthily that we can. He works from home and we have 4 children together, and yet it still doesn't feel like we get enough time together. We've been best friends for almost 13 years. After our children are grown and building their own adult lives, we are looking forward to all the things we will be able to do with each other. That will be significantly less if we are experiencing weight-related health problems. We want to be more active parents for our kids and active grandparents for our potential future grandchildren. We want to be better role models.

All of the healthy older people that we know are healthy weights and tend to piddle around outside, usually in gardens. We are already gardening, but I want to be able to do so even when I'm 80 or 90. That movement is so important! That is my next change that I want to implement. I am more sedentary than I like. Yes, I am chasing after the kids and on my feet cooking, but I'm also spending a lot of time sitting and nursing the baby or driving the kids to activities (we are a homeschool family). While I am frequently moving, my heart rate stays pretty calm. I need to incorporate more activities that cause my heart rate to go up for sure, even if that is just jumping on the trampoline with the kids.

This week we both dropped a significant amount of water weight, both at about 10 pounds lower than we started the week at. This week we ate at an average of 750 calorie deficit (my husband) and 800 calorie deficit (me). My advantage is that I am exclusively breastfeeding, so my TDEE also includes calories lost from breastfeeding (the calculator Weight Loss In Lactation on the website InfantRisk is perfect for figuring this out!).",1767893527.0,8,2,loseit,weight_loss
1q7hhk4,Started at 163 pounds (158 cm) and now I’m at 119 and feel worse,"lost it and now my body feels worse!!

hi 24 f, started the year off at 163 pounds (158cm) in June now im at 119 pounds but my body feels so much worse!

I want to exercise but my body feels too weak to even do that my hands and feet are perpetually cold in 27 degree Celsius (like freezing cold) and I wear 3 layers to sleep with no fan or air con. It feels like I want to lose another 10-15 pounds ish but my body is beyond weak. I used to be able to swim a good 40-50 minutes and today I tried again and I couldn’t even manage 7 minutes. High intensity is terrible and my body aches even on a daily basis my body doesn’t feel up to the demands of day to day life.

Is there anybody who’s been through the same and can help?

EDIT : I think I stopped calorie counting but I eat around 12-1300 on certain days and 17-800 on others!",1767892267.0,224,76,loseit,weight_loss

1q7gqy1,I need some advice…,"When I was in highschool I weighed 270 and I heard about keto. My biggest obstacle to weight loss was being a picky eater but when I realized I could pretty much eat meat to lose weight I knew I could do it. I got down to 220 pounds and then my mom passed away to breast cancer, this kinda broke me.
I was able to maintain 220 into college but my self esteem was the worst it ever was… I had to meet new people and I couldn’t make friends… I blamed it on my weight and tried to lose more but I couldn’t… I went into a cycle of trying and failing and eventually gaining weight.
Now I’m at a point where I don’t believe in myself like I used to… I know how to lose weight it’s just my emotional stability is up and down and I don’t stick with it for more that two weeks.
When I lost weight in highschool it was the most fun thing in the world to me… I would brag about it and jump out of bed in the morning to weigh myself and see if I lost another pound, I guess I wasn’t even ashamed of my weight at the time, or not as bad.

What should I do from an outside perspective, I’m thinking I’ll probably go to therapy because it is mostly a mental block… but if anyone has went through something similar and has some advice it would be nice

1q7fmke,Can the risk of loose skin be calculated?,"I’m wondering if there’s a way to estimate the risk of getting loose skin after weight loss.  
Is there something like a ratio or formula (pre/post-weight) that can help predict it?

My stats:

* Height: 178 cm (5'10"")
* Current weight: 106 kg / 233.7 lb
* Goal weight: 85 kg / 187.4 lb

On top of that, I have eczema, so my skin is not the same as a healthy person, it's more dry, more prone to cracking, less elastic.

What I know so far is that I need to drink a lot of water, not loose my weight too rapidly, preferably build some muscle that will make up space of lost fat and supplementing collagen won't hurt either.",1767888165.0,0,10,loseit,weight_loss
1q7fcwk,kicking sugary drinks was easy,"Why was kicking sugary drinks so easy but I can't kick sugary foods 🤦‍♀  I drink nothing but water now, no juice no soda no energy drinks no alcohol anymore. The alcohol part was a little hard but I did it because I realized it's poison and it also just doesn't taste good lol I was just chasing a high. I might have a breakfast shake but that's it I really wish the candy bars and bread and pasta were so easy but no cigar. I'm diabetic so this really needs to change because this needs to be a life style I'm sick and can't eat what I want to I realized that after learning what diabetes does to your body and that diabetes can't be cured only put into remission so to speak.

1q7f7v8,"When it comes to dating and romance, do you try to seek out people that have the experience of having lost weight?","I've had this question rattling around in my brain for a while: When you're on apps, meeting people, or just dating in general—do you tend to gravitate toward people who've never really struggled with their weight, or do you find yourself more drawn to those who've been through a big weight loss transformation (like dropping 50+ lbs and keeping it off)? Or does it even really matter to you?

For me, as someone who's made a real lifestyle change and lost a significant amount of weight myself, I honestly lean toward people who are either currently on that journey or have already crushed it. There's something incredibly attractive about that level of discipline, self-awareness, and personal growth—it’s the kind of resilience that I deeply relate to and respect just because physical health is something I’ve struggled with almost my entire life and sharing your time with someone who’s had those types of battles.",1767887250.0,2,4,loseit,weight_loss
1q7f1m3,Lost 8 lbs so far! SW: ~185 lbs GW: ~145lbs,"I (28F) have been overweight my entire 20s. Basically from that point on, I have avoided showing my body in any way to anyone out of shame. At the end of 2020, I reached 180 lbs and have been around that weight since then.

In November, I came across a reddit post about a study that essentially redefined the criteria for obesity based on body dimensions rather than BMI. Based on BMI, I’m in the overweight category, rather than obese, but under the new criteria, I am obese. This was a wake up call to me - I do not want to be obese. I want to be healthy. I want to be proud of my body and even show it off a little in the right circumstance.

My main issue was soda. I LOVE coke. It has such a strong flavor that it overpowers over flavors and textures and makes eating easier. (context: I absolutely hate eating. If I could be on a nutrient drip, I would do it). It’s my main vice and as someone with ADHD, it’s one of those dopamine-seeking behaviors that we do. My worst days, I would drink 1 L of coke but most days were closer to 500 mL max, usually less. Obviously this is very unhealthy.

So I quit drinking soda, initially I allowed myself to have a can a week, but eventually stopped that, too. What helped was buying sugar-free water flavoring. I know that’s mega cringe to not just drink water but I genuinely can’t force myself to drink plain water unless I’m outside or doing something sweaty. I also have allowed myself to drink sweetened chai tea once a day. Which admittedly isn’t perfect, but improvement is improvement. My ADHD meds also mean I can’t have caffeine which is another barrier to drinking coke…

My diet has also improved because of this! Often, I’d buy junk food just to have rationale to drink coke as I don’t keep soda in the house (it would disappear too quickly.) I’ve also begun to count calories in a rudimentary fashion, being mindful of portions and controlling myself when hungry. Substituting carbs for lower-carb options has helped in that regard, too. As have protein-rich breakfasts.

I still have a lot to go and my goal weight is a rough estimate, we’ll see how that weight makes me feel. I want to add more physical activity to the mix though winter makes that difficult and I’m terrified of gyms. I need to eat more fruits and veggies and that’s hard because cooking makes me so frustrated and I tend to eat very repetitively (I’m autistic too) and that’s a goal I’ll have to work up to.

But I’m happy with the progress even if it isn’t really yet visible. Maybe my neckline is a little more defined and my waist a tad smaller.",1767886860.0,9,2,loseit,weight_loss
1q7f1hp,How to not feel bitter about skinny friends,"For context I (23F) am overweight, have been trying to be more conscious about my diet, been working on feeling better about myself and just generally trying to lead a healthier lifestyle. My best friend has low normal weight.

Some scenarios that have happened:

- It's 12am and we're both in a voice call. I'm peckish but I drink some water and tell myself that I don't need a snack. My friend then says that she's craving instant noodles and goes to make a pot.

- She calls me asking for advice. She was on a diet previously and reached her goal so she's back to normal. She's eating all the junk food she wants and every time she feels peckish she'll grab a snack. But the weight keeps dropping. She's trying to eat more but she just feels full. She just can't gain weight even though she's trying.

- We're on a holiday together overseas. We eat very similar meals. I eat more than her but I snack less than her. We're both averaging 20k steps a day. 2 weeks in she tells me that she's concerned because her pants have become a lot more looser. When I weighed myself back home, I had gained weight.

Now, I know that I don't see everything, our bodies are different and that I shouldn't compare. We have a very close relationship, I know that I'm the only person who she trusts to tell me about her insecurities and I know that she also admires me for my (comparatively) healthier lifestyle and my (outwardly) positive attitude.

But despite knowing all this rationally, some deep part of me becomes bitter/jealous that my dream is her worst. And that she can eat whatever cravings she wants whenever she wants without a thought about being healthy. It makes me feel like a shit friend.",1767886852.0,145,66,loseit,weight_loss
1q7efxe,I need help with choosing the right meals,"I (f22) would like to loose 20 pounds in 3 months. However, I can't seem to put my cravings aside. Also, I can't go to the gym in these 3 months, I would like to loose the weight only by diet and walking around 5000 steps a day. What meals do you usually make that are low calorie and that help you get through the day? Do you have any specific life hacks that you use to cut down the calorie intake?

I am not tall, I am also a little chubby. Right now I cant go to the gym like I did before because of some obligations that I have. These days I tried some healthy meals but it's not really it. For example i would love to make something new every day, and i dont want my immune system to drop since Ive had some health issues in the past few years. 

I dont have heart problems, nor diabetes, i am not on any diet right now, I only wish to fix my eating habbits and to drop the weight since this weight doesnt suit my height. I would like to read everyones recipes, whether its about making sweet or salty meals. 

For a lot of people (including me) water retention is a problem and it makes my face puffy, hence why Id like to avoid too much salt and spices. ",1767885460.0,0,7,loseit,weight_loss

1q7dmen,Best way to handle food when partner likes having bringing in food and using me as a “vacuum” for junk food,"Hi all, 

Last few years ive gone on an uptrend in weight. Went from weighing 190 in 2020 to recently getting on a scale and weighing 250. The most ive ever weighed. Most of that weight came in the last 2 years. Before i started ti date my gf i was around 220 but it was pretty stable. 

We had a good trend of not eating out and it went well. But then We had a few stressful months and started to binge eat. Im normally someone who doesnt like having junk food at home because i know ill just eat it when im stressed but she likes having frozen food to heat up late st night (i.e. chicken nuggets), random snacks always available, or even when she goes out with people will bring home random junk food. Or even if we are out and about she will just say how she wants a burger, ill mention how we have done so good on our diet and she’ll will nonstop beg for one until it sounds like a good idea to me. Sometiems she will just be on the couch and will just start begging for junk food late st night. I know i need to be stronger and i try bjt at a certain point i just give in.

I work from home so ive had some struggles not snacking so much. And my gf sometiems axts kike im a vacuum for food. Like the other day she brought pizza home because she was out with her sister. Next day while she’s at work she basically texts me to have all the pizza (4 slices) for lunch. For me i had no plans to do that but i got pretty hungry and ended up eating a slice for lunch then 1 for dinner. Im still in the transition where im trying tog et away from that but still have a bit of struggle. Plus i started at a crossfit gym last month so my body has been begging for food because ive been burning a lot more calories recently. 

My gf knows im trying to lose weight, she is trying to lose weight herself. But i feel like her and i have different views on how to lose it and im struggling to not eat certain junk food. 

Has anybody been in a similar situation with a partner? If so how did you handle it.",1767883556.0,7,24,loseit,weight_loss

1q7cqb1,Recomp or Cut?,"Hello everyone,

I’m a 19-year-old male, 5’10” (178 cm), currently weighing 166 lb (75 kg). I used to weigh around 215 lb (97 kg) back in May 2024, which I lost over different periods (with ups and downs). My lowest weight was in August 2025, when I reached 158 lb (72 kg).

Because I was overweight for most of my life, my main goal was always to be as skinny as possible. However, I’m not feeling great with my current physique for a few reasons:
	1.	I’ve gained about 8 lb since my lowest weight, so I look a bit bigger and some clothes don’t fit the same anymore.
	2.	I don’t have much muscle mass — my arms are skinny, and I lost most of the little muscle I had during repeated cuts over the past year.
	3.	My belly has always been soft/flaccid, and abdominal fat has been my biggest insecurity.

Considering all this, recomping seems like the logical option. However, I’m unsure whether I should lose more body fat first before trying to build muscle (cut → bulk), or if recomposition would be better in my situation.

Has anyone here been in a similar position? Would you recommend recomposition, or cutting first? Any advice or personal experience would be really appreciated.

1q7b4o7,Motivation for new GW after reaching first GW,"25F 5’6 SW:213 GW:155 CW153

How do yall get motivated again to reach a new GW after reaching the first one?? When I started my journey last year 155 seemed so far away, and I felt like it was almost impossible to get there. Well in seven months I managed to get there, and I’ve been there since. When I first started losing I was meticulous with my calorie counting, cut out almost all sugars and breads and rice, was extremely consistent and also walked around 2 miles a day. Since hitting my GW I’ve definitely been in maintenance mode. I went from a more active job where I worked 12’s and had time during the week to work out, to a mainly sedentary job where I work 10 hour shifts and feel like I have no time to move my body before during or after work. I also stopped counting my cals meticulously and ate intuitively, using the habits I started during my journey. I have managed to maintain my loss (which I’m really proud of) but the longer I sit at this weight, the more unhappy I am. I am just under the overweight threshold for BMI and since I don’t workout, I still have lots of flab all over, especially in the belly area (have had 2 babies). My new GW is 135. And now it seems even MORE impossible to reach. When I was 213 weight obviously came off a lot easier, now it seems like pulling teeth to even get the scale to move a pound. I know I need to be more precise when counting my cals, and I have started that this past week. But I just feel like I have no room in my schedule to exercise and that’s not helping the situation. How do yall get motivated when you’ve reached a goal you once thought unobtainable and want to move on to the next? Especially when the new goal is objectively harder. Meal prep tips, motivation, and good workout routines I can squeeze in to a super busy day would be greatly appreciated!! ",1767877124.0,8,12,loseit,weight_loss

1q77kdq,Facial hair removed much of my motivation to stay lean.,"Trust me, I don’t wanna get fat again, but for a long time I was very insecure about my chin and jawline. It’s a bit recessed and I store some fat under it, giving me a double chin in certain situations. I remember pushing past the “no longer fat” category to try and really lean out, but I never got where I wanted to be. I grew a short beard a few months ago, and since then my insecurities around my chin almost completely disappeared. I’ve found that I’m much less motivated to get lean than I thought I was. I’m realizing that it was never about abs, it was about having a face that didn’t bother me. Now that I have that under control, “no longer fat” is plenty for me.",1767865094.0,8,19,loseit,weight_loss
1q77ax9,Frustrated rant from a Yo-yo dieter,"I have been on and off diets from the age of 11. I was always 5-10 kgs above my ideal weight. I would lose the 5/10 kgs and then re-gain it once I hit the weight. Like sabotage all of it. 

It’s been 20 years in this cycle. I have again lost and gained the same 10 kgs in the last 1 year. I have taken therapy, I have worked on the emotional reasons but still feel stuck. I know it’s a psychological gap somewhere but I haven’t been able to understand or fix it. 

Currently I would say I am 20 kgs over my ideal weight. I diet for some time and then once I lose a few kilos I start over eating. It’s maybe binge eating cycle - whatever the tag is - I don’t know - but it WEIGHS HEAVY. My life is just stuck on those kilos. My identity core is the person who can’t keep the weight off. I’m sick and tired of myself and my excuses. My inner critic goes so loud and then I eat again to soothe myself. I feel ashamed to even type all of this out and share it here - but it is what it is. I need help, and I don’t know what would help. 

It feels like food addiction. I met a nutritionist recently who said the only way is to detox and eat only fruits / vegetables/ no grains/ no meat etc. I did that for some time and again relapsed. I have tried every thing under the sun - including restrictive diets like keto and more of the no rule diets like intuitive eating. 

I refuse to give up on my dream of having a fit body. But my discipline and excuses and laziness is extremely shitty. I feel like an alcoholic who says I’ll do better from tomorrow, only to slip back into the comfort of eating. 

I can’t imagine life without food. Food taken away from me would feel like my safety and comfort taken away. It feels pathetic to say all of this - but I need to get over this shame and get actual ways of getting help. ",1767864084.0,8,20,loseit,weight_loss

1q75zne,The League of Extraordinary Goalsetters: Week 2,"The league of extraordinary goalsetters: week 2 

Welcome to the League of Extraordinary Goal Setters! The idea of this weekly thread is to write down goals, and break them up into 7 day chunks by figuring out what specific part of the goal you’re working on during the week.

Obviously, if you’re here, one of the goals is probably to lose weight. Whether that’s 2 or 200 pounds, it’s not going to be accomplished by doing one single thing today. However, losing weight is absolutely the product of a million small changes replicates over time— the small things we do each day add up to big changes over time. So, let’s start breaking it on down! 

Let’s kick this off by writing down our goals for this week (if you’re new) and then picking one or two things to work on THIS WEEK. If you’re returning, how did last week go? What went well? What could go better? 

Remember, all threads live and die by comments, so please jump in and support your fellow League members! 

I’ll go first with this weeks prompt: evaluating week 1

My activity goals went out the window; there’s been a giant snowstorm in the Netherlands this week. Biking to work was not a reasonable option for me. Instead, I walked to the grocery store a few times. It’s not as much as I normally do/what I was hoping for, but it is something. This week I am accepting that I probably won’t be very active again either. 

My calorie deficit goals were the real star/difficulty of this week. I have lost a lot of weight, and kept most of it off for years, but it feels like I’m a total noob again. The first weeks of a calorie deficit are always brutal, and this was no exception. My work schedule was especially irregular, which also added to feelings of fatigue and hunger (and also ended in poor sleep). My kid is having some kind of sleep regression, so that hasn’t been helping either. My only goal here is to keep going, and log completely and honestly. 

What went well: I managed to log completely and fully. I avoided a few known snack times for myself. I weighed myself every day. I stuck to what I planned for dinner this week, and have planed next week. 

How did this week go you for you? ",1767859129.0,6,15,loseit,weight_loss
1q75pa7,Need help understanding calorie tracking app,"Hi!
Sorry if this has been asked before.

I use lifesum to track my food and calories. I have been for a while, but I realized recently that I have no idea if the number I get from the app (2095 calories) is supposed to be my maintenance calories or the goal I should be shooting for. I have just been eating like 1500-1600 calories (unsuccessfully mind you. I binge during the weekends...) and hoping that's enough. 

Now, I know I need to do something about my weekend binge no matter what. But since new year I have been wanting to take things more seriously. So what number should I aim for to lose around 0,5 kg/w? Is it 1600, or 2095?

For reference I am male, 31 yo, 181 cm, 118 kgs.

1q75mtx,New to working out and need advice,"I have a new rowing machine and a treadmill with incline at home now. I knew it would allow me to not stress about making time for the gym and committing to going. It’s here and at my disposal for daily use. I’m a beginner at working out. 

I am 5’6 and 151 lbs now. I am 35 years old. I was 160 (my heaviest) as of two weeks ago, but I’ve changed my diet and I’m drinking tons of water. I cut soda and sugar,  and I am following the same kind of diet I’m cooking for my husband since he has ulcerative colitis, and I want to help him too so he’s feeling well and happy. So mostly low Fodmap diet and Mediterranean meals. 
I lost weight fast it feels like in just two weeks with just that change alone. I feel mentally better and physically better since that one change. 
I haven’t been super active in a few years after several health issues and surgeries/complications from surgeries, etc stemming from the birth of my son, to my heart and so on. I had ALLOT of stuff happen and almost died twice. 
Prior to that, I was always small and limber until my body decided to freak out on me. I actually felt too small-too frail and would get made fun of for it constantly. (I’d cry like a baby over it) I was always around 118-120. Now that I’m heavier, even though I only consider myself a bit overweight, I have had relatives make comments on that too. I know I let myself go. Can’t win. It took me a long time to get back on my feet after my health struggles and physical therapies. No excuses now! 

I need help knowing what to do to get down to at least 140 by June. I feel that would be a good middle ground for me. How often do I work out, how long, and any other advice helps. I’d like to really tone up my body and work mostly on my tummy. I have the square mom belly and I want to get rid of it. Will it ever go away? My metabolism isn’t the same and I’m only getting older. I want to feel strong again and in control of myself. What should a workout look like for me with these two machines? I’m feeling confident I can do this. And I’m at a point in my life where I do like myself and I’ve started to just not care about comments, whereas I used to cry about them. I just want to do this for me so I feel better physically better. I’m not complaining anymore, I’m just doing it.

Now after 7 months of 1000-1500 calorie deficit and daily gyming I’ve dropped down to 71 ish kilos. My goal is to drop down below 70, then afterwards have a celebratory cheat week. I’ll be eating to my hearts content whatever and however much I want whenever all according to my whims and desire.

1q756dz,Can I please sanity check my methods.,"28F, 5’9, 300 lbs. 

My husband and I joined some friends for a 75 hard challenge. I’ve been so looking forward to this. I lost 50lbs a few years ago and found what worked for me - calorie counting everything that went into my body in a 500 deficit, eating whole foods prepared in an ‘exciting’ way, and walking for an hour or so each day. The weight dropped off.  I maintained the loss for a while before gaining it back due to illness and lifestyle factors. I wasn’t eating right, I wasn’t tracking, and I wasn’t out walking. Sedentary lifestyle and convenience foods took their toll and now following pregnancy, I’m higher than I’ve ever been. 

However, my husband keeps telling me my plan for this isn’t ’enough’. He said I can’t be eating as many calories as I am, that I need to cut down as much as possible. I need to be eating plainer meals, I can’t have a spoon of Nutella with my yoghurt or a Coke Zero with my dinner, because that’s not what people do to lose weight. I’m also breastfeeding right now and need to be careful with supply but he points out women in his family who restricted a lot while feeding and had no problems.

The main thing is the exercise. He gets really weird about the fact I’m only walking and doing Pilates. He keeps saying it’s not enough and I need to be doing CrossFit or HIIT workouts. I’ve tried saying they don’t work for me and that I know what I’m doing and could he please trust me in I know what’s best for my body, but he says it’s not going to work again this time around because we’re older now and life looks different. He’s getting frustrated with me.

The thing is, I’m a big big gal. My Pilates (which he struggles to finish when I get him to join me) gets my heart rate hella up and I sweat a lot. Walking leaves me puffed and sweating. But he says Pilates won’t help me lose weight at all, will only be good for toning and not even muscle building. 

Idk what to do. I love body positivity but am also aware there’s a tendency to kind of wish-wash bigger people that just drinking more water or swapping white bread for whole grain will magically change their lives, and I’m worried I’m now carrying that sort of mindset. 

I’d appreciate any opinions and input. Thank you. ",1767856099.0,31,61,loseit,weight_loss

Wondering what sort of exercise I should be doing, I know cardio is important but not sure how I should start, take treadmill as the classic example, whats a good time split between low speed and high speed for beginners? I was thinking like 5 min run 1 min walk repeating or smth? Not sure.
I dont know if i should be focusing on like heavy weights as well? 

I also just naturally run at a calorie deficit a lot fo the time. Maybe consume 1000 a day? I know that aint healthy and have been meaning to try focus on fixing it more. But honestly, I kinda just forget to eat? If anyone else has had similar experience in thst regsrd and has some advice it'd be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

1q70aoe,Is anyone else’s hobby basically ‘not to get fat’?,"I like to run a lot and work out. I have a busy life, a career, husband, home owner, parent. I put a lot of work to mentally inspire myself to workout and diet. I’m not particularly passionate about running per se. I don’t have a strong desire to go on scenic runs or run races. I’m perfectly fine running on the treadmill and watching sports or videos. It’s all mostly just to not get fat after years of trying to lose weight and succeeding. It’s basically my hobby. My art and craft. But to not sound totally psycho I just say I like to run as a hobby. But it’s mostly so I don’t gain weight and can eat more on cheat days

1q6zqev,How many calories isn't enough/how to eat more?,"Hi everyone!

So I've been trying to get into shape for the past two months, currently I'm 23f, 5""6, and 208 lb. I do about 8-10 hours a week of dance and other cardio/strengthening classes at my studio, I stretch and do calisthenics about 5 nights a week, and just recently started going to the gym again with a goal of going at least twice a week. I also go on a few walks a week (when the weather isn't horrendous). Safe to say, even with a margin of error on my Apple Watch, I've been burning a lot of calories.

I've been doing really good at tracking my calories for a month now. I spent the first couple weeks just getting an understanding, and the past two weeks I've really been focusing on my macros (especially prioritizing 100g protein). The thing is I have a super small appetite. I rarely even come close to the 1800 Lose It says I should be eating. I'm probably averaging around 1200 a day on days when I don't exercise, and on days when I do, it's super hard for me to eat enough properly to sustain my body through three hours of dance and eat back any amount of those calories after. Yesterday, I burned almost 600 calories in my classes and my net calories for the day was 553 and I went to sleep not starving at all. I'm not even dropping a significant amount of weight from this.

So how many calories is not enough? I've barely changed anything in my diet other than adding more protein. 90% of the meals I eat are home cooked. Is there a certain point where I should be forcing myself to eat more food? If so, how do I eat more food without making myself nauseous and uncomfortable? 

I'm mainly concerned about ""starvation mode."" I've heard some people saying it's real, and others saying not to worry about it. I've also heard people saying they weren't able to lose weight until they were eating enough of their calories. And I've been losing weight at a super slow pace. Maybe .5 lb/week.",1767839673.0,0,11,loseit,weight_loss

1q6yvo7,"Are Amazon Fresh frozen meals (Healthy Choice, Lean Cuisine, etc.) worth it for weight loss?","I’m a 25yo male aiming for \~1400 cals/day. I’m super busy and cooking is what makes me fall off, so I’m considering using Amazon Fresh frozen meals like Healthy Choice Cafe Steamers and Healthy Choice Power Bowls (and Lean Cuisine) as my default meals.

From the labels on the ones I’m buying (Healthy Choice General Tso’s, Healthy Choice Power Bowl Beef Teriyaki, Lean Cuisine Herb Roasted Chicken), the average per meal is about:

* Calories: \~213
* Protein: \~16.7g
* Sodium: \~547mg

* 5 meals/day: \~1,067 cals, \~83.3g protein, \~2,733mg sodium

1q6vxtd,First few days of eating better,"Hi all, 
I'm 20F 125 kg at 5""6. I don't want to make excuses as I know I'm going to seriously harm myself if I carry on the way I'm going with my weight. I have dyspraxia and unmedicated ADHD which means both the moving my body part of loosing weight and the appetite/impulse control part is going to be incredibly difficult. 

Never the less, the past 3 days I've managed 3 30g protein shakes a day, and kept my calories below 1900. (My BMR is 2184 and at the moment I'm not very active due to studying for exams). I've swapped to purely 0 sugar energy drinks (and cut down) over the past 2 months to deal with that issue before I dealt with my one true vice/main source of dopamine seeking food. Because I'm trying high protein the food noise is so much less than previous times I've tried to loose weight by just eating in a calorie deficit. 

How I got here, I was put on a medication as a toddler that caused me to put on weight rapidly. I wasn't taken off it until I was 4 then I bounced between a house with zero food restrictions and a house which was abusive and controlling especially regarding food. My brain basically got the memo of ""you eat what you can or you might not get fed again"" which then caused the inevitable binge cycle that I have been struggling with for years. 

What's changed? Decent therapy and a supportive therapist means my anxiety and insecurity levels are at an all time low after 18 months of consistent sessions. What actually flipped the switch for me wasnt actually the desire to loose weight (although that is a desire) but the constantly feeling hungry all the time when I eat like shit. It's a vicious cycle. I'm using the macros app to track it as it is the most straightforward to use (in the past used my fitness pal but redownloaded it and the macros tracking is now behind a paywall which isn't what I want). 

I am primarily focusing on high protein (aiming for 150g+ a day) and relatively low calorie. Where I'm scared I might backslide is post my exams in a couple weeks when I go back to full time in person uni. I'm not a massive breakfast eater or morning person so I vicious cycle when I'm at uni between not eating because I'm distracted and don't feel hunger cues to then having my brain going ""I'm starving"" to binging on dopamine foods like crisps and chocolate because they are easily accessible and doesn't require decisions because I know I like them.   What I'm planning on doing is filling my shaker up the night before and preportioning the powder so all I have to do in the AM is dump it in and shake. I might even trial making the night before although I've heard that can effect taste. 

I am planning on incorporating some increased exercise but with everything going on with exams and uni I need to find a rythmn again before I add something else - the diet changes alone are going to be difficult let alone getting my brain to purposely exercise (because I'm uncoordinated and struggle I've got a negative association I need to break down both in therapy and hopefully at the gym at the start of February as I'm planning on starting after the new year rush fizzles a bit)

I'd love some guidance if possible and someone to tell me I'm not crazy 😂. 

I'm also doing this quietly in real life because I don't want the attention on me. My family goes overboard at everything and if I ""fail"" I know I'll be less likely to get back on it if the attention is there. I do need some support though I'm not crazy in believing I can do this 100% unsupported hence coming here.

1q6vtd0,"NSV: 1,000,000 Steps down. Fight NEATer not harder.","I hit my 100 day streak of 10k steps a day today. (Actual total was 1,224,028)

I actually started about two week earlier but my watch didn't sync right, and restarted the streak. That annoyed me, but for simplicity I'll just stick to the current streak in my watch's app.

I started it for a couple of reasons, first of all, I noticed that on days that my partner did the dog walks, I barely moved, my job is sedentary and even though I do go to the gym every day, outside of that I just sat at my desk for hours on end. Knowing that NEAT declines the longer you diet, I knew I had to find motivation to actually move otherwise I was going pick up even worse habits and never keep the weight off long term.

The second reason, and why I picked 10k steps specifically (yes I know it was japanese marketing), was because you hear about it a lot, and I was curious what it meant for a sedentary person to achieve that, I know it's trivial for people who work on their feet all day. Well it turns out, at just over 100 steps a minute give or take, which is reasonable pace, you're looking at an hour and a half of purposeful walking. Every day. Thankfully we've got a dog who absolutely is loving life with that.

The other thing I noticed, was that I found excuses to get my steps in, instead of dropping of a parcel 5 minutes away in the car, I'll instead walk 20 minutes there and back for 'free' steps. In the gym in between sets I walk about backwards and forwards - makes me look a little psychotic like I'm patrolling the equipment... but at least I'm moving and it's not impacting me, I would have just sat down instead.

I was estimating what I think it's contributed to my weight loss in the last 100 days, and I think, considering where we walk is reasonably hilly, that it has probably accounted for **5kgs** above and beyond what I would have done sticking under 2k steps most days. I think that's a conservative estimate, as well. NEAT reduction is no joke in diets.

Other things I've learnt: 

* Trolleys can go screw themselves, resting your hand on a trolley doesn't trigger the watch as much, so twenty minutes in a supermarket can lead to only a couple hundred registered steps. That's infuriating.
* The trolley experience was compensated by my daughter's nativity and an offspring concert when each time you clap you get a step. (I definitely still did the steps on those days)
* Cardio on a bike (which I do): 0 steps. Running (which my partner does): lots of steps. Not fair.
* It's totally ok and normal to do laps of the kitchen to get those last 500 on those days you're a bit short. Right?
* Just learnt today in the ice; walking gingerly across slippy paths seems to also not count very many steps..

Wierdest thing I've done besides the kitchen laps to get my steps in?
* 15 Loops of a motorway service station. Travel days to visit family many hours away left little opportunity, so looping the food court had to be done. Definitely would have looked insane.

On to the next 100 days, and I highly recommend incorporating a non-exercise activity (as in something that's movement but not directly cardio - my way of judging it is something you would neccessarily get changed to do counts as a non-exercise activity) goal of some sort that gradually ramps up in your weight loss - I also played a lot of ryhthm based vr over christmas which is good if you have access to it.",1767829589.0,3,5,loseit,weight_loss

That alone feels like a big accomplishment, but now I’m facing a mental hurdle I didn’t fully expect. I stepped on the scale recently and realized I’m only about 3 pounds away from my goal weight. Instead of feeling proud or calm, my first reaction surprised me. Almost immediately, I opened a fast food app and started loading up my cart with all the things I’ve been avoiding. Then I switched over to my grocery app and started adding chocolates and snacks I haven’t eaten in a long time. It felt automatic, like my brain went into panic mode.

I didn’t actually buy any of it, but the thoughts are loud and constant. I can’t stop thinking about food, cravings, and the idea of “finally” letting go once I hit my goal. It feels like being so close has somehow made everything harder, not easier. Part of me is scared that once I reach my goal weight, I’ll immediately undo all the work I’ve put in over the past year.

1q6s5ph,Beginning Weight Loss and Feeling Discouraged,"This post is for me to work out some thoughts and get some other people's point of view.

I'm starting to take my health seriously this year. My starting weight is 202 lbs. The plan for now is for eight weeks eat at a calorie deficit, eat high protein, and walk 8000 steps a day. Then a month at maintenance calories and re-evalute for the next eight weeks. 

I've been consistent for a week and a half. This is the longest I've really done for a health change. So far I have technically lost two pounds. But that is the two pounds that I alway fluctuate with. The scale is moving in the right direction. I feel confident that I will do this for the eight weeks.

But I feel so discouraged. I know progress is slow day to day. I have barely started. The two pounds I lost don't feel like a win because I'm still in my normal weight range. I know change will come with consistency. I wish I was further along to see my weight outside my normal range so I could know that it's going ok. I just feel sad about losing weight. Maybe the sadness is from being in this position to begin with. I feel like I'm grieving.

I'm proud of myself for being consistent and making a change. It's hard to change your habits. But that feeling is over shadowed by some cloud of sadness.

Has anyone else felt this way when starting weight loss or during the process? I don't really have the words for how I'm feeling so I can't really talk about it with the people who support me.",1767821051.0,8,17,loseit,weight_loss
1q6r0ag,Feel older since losing weight?,"I’m 35 years old, 5”3 and have lost 31lbs. I was 189lbs, I’m now 160lbs and I plan to lose 10lbs more.

I’m over the moon and couldn’t be happier it’s honestly a dream come true.

But I’m really struggling with feeling and looking older in my face. I had such a lovely plump face before! 😆 It’s really affected my confidence. I was almost more confident before the weight loss.

Has anyone else that’s lost weight, seen the feeling of age, facial sagging and neck sagging improve once it “settles” after a few months or years? Any treatments you had that helped? I live a toxin free life so no fillers or Botox but happy with non surgical options.

To be honest, I’d like solutions or advice. I don’t need self worth advice lol. I know getting older is a part of life, that its inevitable when losing weight when not in your 20s and I should learn to live with it. 😆",1767818463.0,35,38,loseit,weight_loss
1q6qys0,When will I get my projection?,"Over December I overate a lot, like thousands of calories over per week, but I still tracked everything (& switched to maintenance on the app although I was obviously eating in a surplus). January I’m back on track and eating in a deficit.

When I click “done logging” though on LoseIt, it doesn’t show a specific date anymore and just says: “On average, you are 575 calories over budget each day for the past 28 days.”

I know that isn’t actually accurate for right now, but I weirdly still find it motivating. When will it go back to showing a daily number again? Is it once it’s been 28 days since my last overeating day?",1767818364.0,1,5,loseit,weight_loss
1q6qaoe,I went for vacation for 2 weeks and only came back 2lbs heavier!,"Sounds like success to me tbh! I went back home for vacation with my family 2 weeks ago. It was definitely a last minute decision too so I wasn’t really mentally prepared. I mostly ate what family cooked or street foods or whatever we could afford. The time zone differences were definitely messing with my sleep and functioning too lol. The 2-3 7-8 hour flights were exhausting. We did a lot of walking but also a ton of more driving. The heat was too strong and I felt puffy most of the time. I did my best to be mindful of how much I ate and what I ate but same days meals were just not in my control and I had to make do with what I had. Other days I just decided I’d do my best to stay in maintenance. I was convinced that I’d be up at least 4-5lbs and I was fully prepared to accept that. Then I got my period yesterday which adds even more noise on the scale. And I also ended up getting sick 2-3 days before leaving and am just now starting to feel a bit better. But I weighed myself today and I was up 2.2lbs which put me at around 160lbs! I’ll take it! Also I bought new workout clothes while I was away so now I get to start the year fresh and ready. 

In my country you’re often encouraged to eat more and to finish your plate. I kept getting told that I shouldn’t lose any more weight or I would be asked if I even ate food at all lol. But I enjoyed some wine with my family, cake, yummy traditional food, etc. And I don’t regret it at all! 

I think past me would’ve been so down and upset at myself. But the only direction towards progress is forward. 

I made tremendous progress in 2025 and 2026 is just another year for even more growth and excitement. I’m excited to try new exercises, new ways of moving my body, new foods, and to adopt new mindsets and perspectives! 🎊💃🏽",1767816861.0,23,2,loseit,weight_loss
1q6px08,I'm finding it very difficult to sustain a calorie deficit while being very physically active,"I've (32m) become much more physically active in past 1.5 years than I've been in the past. I went from running 2-3 days a week and only running 4-6 miles total per week to running 5 days a week and doing 20-40 miles per week (depending on whether I'm training for a race or just maintaining). Similarly with weightlifting, I went from being very inconsistent and kind of half-assing it to do intense full-body workouts twice a week, including the big three barbell lifts (ideally I'd lift three days a week, but that's not feasible right now with my schedule). I also occasionally do physically active hobbies like bouldering, yoga, or volleyball which I didn't do in the past.

I'm 15 pounds overweight, but I have not lost any weight despite all this activity. I'm certainly a bit leaner than I was a couple years ago, but when I look in the mirror I still basically have a dad bod, just a somewhat fitter version of it. I'm not a guy who's so muscular that BMI is misleading.

Now, I know that diet is more important than exercise for losing weight. As they say, you can't outrun a bad diet. But here's where I'm struggling. When I'm this physically active, I feel like absolute shit whenever I try to maintain a caloric deficit for more than few days. I'm talking fatigue, loss of motivation, decreased performance while exercising, decreased libido, carb and sugar cravings, intense hunger, and more frequently and intense negative feelings. When I start eating more again, I start to feel better, but then I'm once again not losing weight.

None of this happened to me when I went from 30 pounds to 15 pounds overweight a few years ago, and was exercising much less than I do now. It required a little discipline to resist snacking, but I didn't experience any negative side effects.

I'm currently training for a marathon in February, so I'm not looking to lose weight until after the race as doing so will probably hurt my performance, but afterwards I'd like to really try trimming off this fat once and for all.

Any advice for sustainably maintaining a caloric deficit while exercising frequently?",1767816036.0,10,15,loseit,weight_loss
1q6p30w,Attempting to figure out how to go about losing fat while gaining muscle,"Hi all, I (22M) am a college student right now in my senior year, and I’ve never really been active.  I played a little football in middle school but quit, and really ever since havnt worried about physical well-being.  I’m an absolute nerd so most of my time is spend programming computers or building electronics, among other things like reading and playing video games, so as you can see I’m quite sedentary.  

A little about my body; I am 6’8” (yes I know very tall, DONT ask if I play basketball I’m too uncoordinated LOL), and weigh about 280 lbs.  I do work a job in maintenance/grounds right now where I have to lift a lot, so I do have a somewhat firm basis of muscle in my legs and arms.  I am very skinny-fat; whenever I have clothes on you can just slightly tell I have some chub but whenever I’m bloated or take my shirt off you can tell I have a bad beer belly

Part of the reason I’m starting a fitness journey is because as of recent I’ve become engrossed in self hatred over my body and I actually only used to be 250 lbs; however, because of a lot of personal stuff I’ve gotten deep into alcohol abuse and drug use this year which have led to me destroying a lot of my academic life and physical life, as well as putting on almost 30-40 lbs.  I can also feel my health deteriorating, and I feel like I could have a heart attack any day now.  After having some severe alcohol withdrawals the last week I bought a gym membership and said I’m turning my life around before my last semester of school for my own confidence.

The problem is, I don’t know where to start! I’m going to the gym tonight for the first time since middle school and I have no idea what to do.  I’ve also tried to cut to only 2000 calories a day the part 3 months but have failed miserably.  My current dilemma is I don’t know whether to cut calories or to eat more calories to support weight lifting.  I want to get primarily into weightlifting as I look up heavily to characters like Guts from the anime Berserk as well as figures like Zyzz.  Also I have the stature to become ripped if I just actually worked out and got my posture right and better form and muscles.

I also don’t know if I should do any cardio or if it would kill my gains.  I’ve heard a lot of weightlifters put down cardio, and I personally hate it but I don’t know if it’s necessary or not.  I’m trying to find a good gym routine but it’s a lot more difficult than I thought it would be.

1q6o8g7,"[Progress Pics] M/31/5’10 [315lbs>170lbs] (12 Months)… Yes, I know it’s long….","https://imgur.com/a/c82sLtv

I will start this by saying that I never within one single fiber of my being, thought that I would be sitting here typing this out for the world to see.

I lived my entire life overweight, from a very young boy - 30 years of age. I vividly remember being TERRIFIED of seeing my weight on a scale, but remember being forced at 13 years old, due to joining a boxing club, step on said scale… I weighed 193lbs that day, ingrained in my memory for the rest of my life… I remember thinking “you’re almost 200lbs… When are you going to do something about this?”….

Well, little did I know, I would go another 17 years of my life very obese and unhealthy. All while convincing myself that I was perfectly fine, and happy the way that I was. This “happiness” truly could not have been further from the truth. Yet I did truly believe I was happy with myself, this was not a lie. I had developed hypertension, high blood sugar (very close to diabetic), gout in both of my feet, severe joint pain, and a lower back that I would be thrilled to have only go out once per month. I also was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome at 7 years old (which may sound out of place, but does play a massive role in my story).

I have always been a researcher, a learner. I would say it’s truly, deep down, my favorite hobby as an adult. Theology studies are usually my go to, throughout all aspects of life. When I stumbled upon fasting and what a single ingredient, near “ancestral” lifestyle “Could” do for you. I decided to for the 4,560th time, to try another “diet”. These rules felt super simple, because I mean… they were… If it doesn’t have an ingredients label, and is a natural, whole food, it’s fine. Otherwise, don’t eat it…

I went into this as I always do to a new “diet”. Very motivated, very pumped, and ready to overdo the absolute hell out of it for a few weeks, then crash back out and eat 8 honey buns mashed up in a half gallon of bluebell ice cream (true story….. sadly)…….

The first few weeks of this were honestly super easy, and you guessed it, I seen absolutely zero results in regard to weight loss. However, for the first time in my life. I felt “different”. I was aggravated, yet super calm (more of both than usual). This feeling, this change, was something I hadn’t felt, and it went unexplained for quite some time for me. But the feeling beings so unique, I continued this “diet”.

Fast forward to 2 months in….. This guy is fu\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\* DYING, I do not want to continue doing this. (This was addiction kicking in full force). I was driving down the road, between two local towns and I said “I’m weighing myself when I get home, if I haven’t lost any weight, I’m done with this and I’m going to have pizza tonight.” Keep in mind like I said earlier, that childhood fear of scales still existed for me… I knew how much I weighed when I started the fasting. I was 303lbs (I always fluctuated between 300-315lbs). But I had not weighed myself in over a month in this instance of almost breaking.. I arrived home, and aggressively pulled the scale that was laying vertically against the wall onto the floor and stepped on it… 289. 2 months in, and I had lost 14lbs. This was JUST enough to keep me going, but I still thought about that pizza and spicy ranch that night…..

I began to hone in on this “feeling” that I spoke of earlier. It was alignment, it was restoration of frequency, it was me healing from fasting and a natural diet. I started to compare what I was feeling to the countless theological texts I’ve read throughout the years, and THIS is what they spoke of. Consciousness, frequency, peace. It took 4 months before this had sat in with me. I knew at that point, nothing would stop me, I could finally see the metaphorical forest for the trees, I no longer needed motivation, I (me) became the motivation. I was healing from no longer poisoning my body, and allowing myself to heal.

At around the 6 month mark into this journey, decided to really understand the gym, strength training and this was where I discovered a passion for running. Never in my 30 years on this earth, did I think I would ever be running, unless something was chasing me (I’ve used that ole line a few times). 1 mile per day, turned into 2, then 3, then workin my way up to 7. I jogged/ran 5-7 miles per day, 5-6 days per week, while strength training 3-5 days per week as well. How you may ask? Why? Why at 30 years old would you possibly want to starting running that much.. How can you possibly get your mindset wrapped around that? This is what I mean when I say I discovered healing through fasting. It rewired my brain, it made replacement theory so incredibly easy to do that anything became possible. I read a story of Nikola Tesla walking around his office building 3 times, opening a door 3 times while consciously thinking of a negative connotative behavior and positive one in which he wanted to replace it with. I applied this and watched my subconscious begin to stop thinking of the negatives which doing the positive. This in turn swapped the mental energy I had for lazy or lustful activities, and re-manifested them into positive, healthy actions. 

Weight loss became an after thought soon after,  as I began to feel better and better every day. I get very emotional talking about it now, but this became a chase to see just how sick I was before. To prove a point to the people around me, my loved ones, my friends, that you can naturally heal yourself. You do not “need” pills, you do not “need” shots (while I do not in any way condemn anything like that, whatever makes you truly reach your higher self, by all means, your journey is yours), you can heal your mind, your soul and your body naturally. By controlling what you put in it. It all began to make sense at this point. This DWARFS the feeling of any food I have ever tasted at the Michelin star restaurants, or even my grandmothers homemade German chocolate cake. NOTHING tastes as good as I feel. NOTHING tastes better than waking up every day with a pure heart, a healthy body, mind and soul.

You’ll face persecution through this journey. You’re going to find out who your friends are very fast. You’ll notice how supportive everyone around you is to begin with. The more you evolve, you’ll know the ones that truly support you. You’ll know who truly means it, and you’ll know the ones who push you away, as it is a reflection of what exists within them. Friends will come and go, please do not let this lead you astray, because it’s ABSOLUTELY heartbreaking. But you must do this to discover your inner peace, to find true happiness. Your friends parts in your story are simply over, you should not stray just to keep them around. This is an unnatural phenomenon made to lead you into a left hand path, which will lead you right back to where you started. If they’re meant to be in your life, they will return.

\*\*In reference to the issues I had before changing my lifestyle.\*\*

\- Tourette’s - 98% cured (if you have Tourette’s you understand what this actually means for you)

\- Blood sugar - cured

\- Hypertension - cured

\- Gout - Cured (over a year now with no flare up)

\- Lower back - Cured through training my lower back in the gym

\- \*\*knocking on wood\*\* I have not been sick since changing my lifestyle. Not a cold, not anything. I was a very regularly sick human being before. Amazing what only putting good foods in your body and moving every day can do for your immune system. We aren’t fighting the poison we ingest, the fasting allows me to heal and fight infection now. Why do we lose our appetite when we get sick? The body’s most effective way of healing is through fasting. Your body is telling you to stop eating and using its resources to digest food.

07/15/2024 - 303lbs

07/26/2025 - 170lbs

I ended up going down to 162lbs at my lowest, but I have since rebuilt muscle and I am currently sitting at 173lbs with a body fat percentage of 12.1%. (The goal is 10% body fat and 175lbs.)

I have ENDLESS energy, I WANT to workout every day because I actually FEEL GOOD…. I HATED anything to do with moving before, I liked gaming and watching TV… Now I only want to workout, play golf, be active and healthy.

This is a lifestyle, it’s not a “diet”. I still only eat eggs, beef, chicken, fish, low carbohydrate vegetables, and fruit. Nothing else. And I absolutely thrive doing it. Without any form of craving whatsoever for bad food. I never think about eating unhealthy or processed foods. I can have a great time out with my friends at dinner at a bar, I won’t drink a drop of alcohol, and what they only have burgers? Great, give me 5 burger patties and that will be all. You don’t have to conform to society to enjoy yourself and the people you’re with. If the people you’re with do not support that, or peer pressure you to do something. I have news for you, the company you’re keeping is a MASSIVE issue you’re having with more than just your weight. If your friends don’t support you in a super positive change you’re making for your life and the betterment of you………. They’re not your friends. Reevaluate.

I’m asked very regularly if I’m “carnivore”,  “Paleo”, “Keto”.?? “What exactly are you?” Well that answer is simply, I’m nothing. I eat for what works for ME.  What I mean by that is, I will forever add natural foods, meats, vegetables, fruit in and out of my life, based on HOW I FEEL EATING THEM. Nothing else matters when you’ve arrived at that level of sentience in your body. You know what is and isn’t making you feel at your best. While you’re eating any and everything under the moon 3-5 meals per day, you have zero clue which combo of the 3000 chemicals and compounds you ingested are making you feel bad, you cannot possibly know. Hell, the odds are, you probably don’t know just how bad you feel anyway.

In no way shape or form am I sitting here writing this to push you into doing it exactly how I did it. That would undermine my entire belief system of what I’m covered here.  I am only here to say, this is about a mental shift if you want true, long lasting, permanent results. You have to become a more conscious being to truly become ready to do it. You don’t get to cheat nature, as popular of a belief as that may be today. You CAN blossom, you CAN discover you, in YOUR way. For me, it was a mental awakening triggered by fasting and discovering how to realign my energy and my frequency to life in general. Realizing I am in full control of my manifestation. We create light and darkness, and both MUST exist.

YOU are the creator, all things are possible. All you have to do is manifest your reality. Believe it before it’s even there. I walked around at 260lbs, fully believing and visioning my self at the 170lbs I currently am.

My DM’s are ALWAYS open, I’m here for absolutely anyone who needs help. I want you to know, you’re not alone, and if this guy can do this and become reborn, so can you.

1q6o3iy,Weight Fluctuation,"I've started my weight loss journey and my weight seems to be fluctuating like crazy (well, at least to me). Is this typical for a week or maybe an issue with my scale? I'm confused about what I actually weigh because 219 vs. 213 seems pretty different. Maybe I should just take an average of the two?

1/1 - 215.6

In the past when I've lost weight, it has seemed more consistent (i.e. losing 1 or 2 lbs per week or just staying the same). I will say this is my highest weight, so I'm not sure if things tend to fluctuate more when you weigh more.

1q6ny8k,My Goal,"Last year I closed my business the week before my wife had a major surgery. This has been a huge rollercoaster. She's fine now! And the stress is slowly leaving my body. During that time, though, my heart problems came back and got worse. I was stress-eating and literally working from 6AM to midnight daily without breaks for days at a time. I was not healthy. My wife got a virtual personal trainer that has been helping her lose weight for the past several months. It's been great for her! I decided I wanted to do the same thing. So this is my goal for 2026: To lose 100 pounds by December 31st and go from 282 to 180. I'm down 1 pound after the first week, and keeping myself at a 1k calorie deficit daily.

1q6nqqn,Picking back up after the holidays,"After 20 years of eating in a very unhealthy fashion I finally got things under control for the first time in my adult life at the ripe age of 42. For almost a year now I've been trying to treat sugar more like an addictive substance and less like a coping mechanism and voila - about 23kg/50lbs down after about 7-8 months. Well, that, and, healthier eating habits in general, you know? More vegetables and fruits, less sugar and meat. Healthy carbs if possible, poultry instead of red meat if possible. Stuff like that.

When it became cold outside, I got hungrier. I started eating more sugar again. I gained a few kilos. I've been scared of the yo-yo effect, ngl. I'm well acquainted with that one.

The last few months have been an exercise in moderation. I ate too much, but not as much as I used to. I enjoyed the treats that show up for Christmas. I indulged for a while. I told myself this is fine as long as I don't overdo it too much.

But I've always told myself that this is temporary. Now that the holidays are over, I've climbed back on the train. I haven't eaten any sugary foods/sweets for over a week (started a bit before new year's). My plan is to go at least 2 months without any sweets, just like last year when I started this journey. That includes cake and cookies. It's not easy, but it's also not as hard as it used to be. I most certainly need the reset that comes with abstaining.

Beyond that I'm also trying to make better decisions every day. I just finished cutting a fruit salad to carry me through my sugar cravings for the next few days. Doing these things for myself makes me feel content, something that does not come naturally to me.

I really want to know what it's like to be slim. What if I actually manage to pull this off? I have come so far and now I know what to do...

Last year was amazing all things considered, what if this year turns out to be even more amazing? Still down 15+ kg and now I am back on track. Let's go.",1767811354.0,5,0,loseit,weight_loss

I lost 100lbs from 2023-2024, which was great, but I gained RED-S in the process. To get my period back (hard to get motivated about, btw -- I didn't miss her) I jacked up my calories to 2300cal on workout days, 2000 on rest days, and I successfully got back into a cycle for three months.

I'm selling them to the highest bidder whoever wants em) and want to be back to my initial low, but I don't want to have to start this process all over again.

My potential plan is, now that I've got my period back three months in a row, I'd like to slowly start losing, with a week-long break every month.

1q6masp,I realized I was using a food scale incorrectly for months,"This is very embarrassing to admit, but I’ve been on a weight-loss journey since September 2025. I’ve lost 20 pounds so far. Recently, I came across a video scrolling on Instagram Reels about how to use a food scale and realized I’d been using it wrong the whole time. 

The way I've been using a food scale is, I turn it on, put my container on the scale, record the initial weight with my phone calculator, when I put my my ingredients into the container I record that with my calculator, and then subtract the new weight from the initial weight. So complicated for no reason. 

But the correct way to do it is, turning your scale on, adding the container, then pressing the power button to tare, and then adding your items, because the scale literally subtracts it for you. Like duhh!!! I feel like such a knobhead. I've been doing the job of the food scale for months and years. I could have been saving minutes from my prep time. 

You live and you learn, I guess, so I feel less alone in my foolishness. What is something you found that there was an easier way to do it? Also, trying to gauge if I'm doing anything else incorrectly.

I do the usual chicken thigh/breast, rice, veggies but I have to use protein shakes too in order to hit my macros. Some days it feels like a lot, others I just am in flow state and get it done like nothing.

1q6kn6s,Gained 6 pounds in 2 weeks,"I’m wondering if anyone can offer some insight here, I’ve been on a weight loss journey for a little less than a year now and have lost around 20 pounds, I was maintaining at around 113-115 right before Christmas. On Christmas morning I weighed in at 112.8 which was the first time I had gone under 113 so I figured it was a fluke. On Christmas I had a “cheat day” but nothing too insane I definitely did not binge or eat past the point of comfort. And starting the next day I went back to my usual 1450 cals a day. On the 27th I weighed in at 116.4 which I was pretty surprised about I expected a couple of pounds but not almost 4 pounds, I continued as normal and instead of my weight going back down to my usual it has fluctuated like crazy for the last 2 weeks and now I’m up to 118 this morning… here have been my weigh ins from the 24th to now on January 7th

1q6k7pv,why does eating healthy seem so hard?,"i'm currently 265 lbs and trying to get under 200lbs this year.

i gained a lot of weight over the years eating out excessively. i'm trying to cut out on fast food starting this year because i want to loose weight and save money. but god, it is so hard. fast food used to be my way of getting dopamine. it is so hard to stop. but the only reason i'm stopping right now i guess is i need money for dental work. and i'd rather not eat out and invest in my dental work. (i don't have dental insurance)

also, there's an aldi nearby and i'm trying to plan my meals. it is so hard to meal prep and plan what you can eat around 1800 kcals and prioritizing protein and fiber. i'm also a broke college student and i don't eat red meats and i have texture problem with chicken breast. i don't eat turkey as well

i guess i just wanted to rant a little bit. 

i want to eat as much as my heart desires but god this holiday season i felt terrible because i didn't have anything i could wear. i went out shopping for clothes and i was so discouraged. ",1767803834.0,13,40,loseit,weight_loss
1q6k11j,Extremely Difficult Weight Loss,"Hi all, hope this is ok to post here. I’m looking for some input or advice because I’m truly at a loss. I’ve always been around 129-135 pounds pretty much my whole life. A few years ago, I went from  bedside nursing to a sedentary job and gained about 25 lbs. I was definitely moving less but never felt as though I was eating much more or worse. Since then it has been a nightmare trying to lose this extra weight gain. I’ve been working out, bought a standing desk and walking pad, take breaks throughout the day etc. I use noom to track all my food intake. I went vegetarian and focus on veggies and protein intake as well. My thyroid was a bit off and I was started on synthroid, but this has been stable for the last 2 years. The only thing that has helped me lose weight is a glp 1, but in 7 months I’ve lost 5 pounds. It seems the only way I can lose the weight is eating about 800 cals a day, but that’s pretty unsustainable for me. Also, as soon as I lose a couple pounds and go back to normal eating, I immediately gain weight back…like I’m talking pounds in a week per my scale. I’ve struggled with body image and eating disorders in the past, and although I’ve worked through some of that, it’s still extremely difficult for me to be confident or feel like I’m doing my best when I feel uncomfortable looking at myself or disliking how my clothes fit etc. Does anyone have experience with this or know what could help? Certain types of diet or exercise? Have tried weights and keto. Is it just my 30s metabolism kicking in? All my other medical testing has been totally normal.

1q6jyw4,Losing weight but I'm so scared I'm going to yo yo again. Any advice?,"So, I'ma type 2 diabetic.  I recently got a lab back that said i'm 8.4 A1C whereas before I was a 7.4.  The doctors are changing my medicine to something that is way more expensive and my insurance is awful so I have to pay for it out of pocket.  I say all this to say that I am seriously trying to lose weight in order to reclaim my health.  

I have lost weight before.  Down to 170 from my normal 200 and my symptoms went away and I was really happy with the way my clothes were starting to fit me.  I've been big all my life so it was nice to be able to shop wherever I wanted for a change.  The problem was that this was during the pandemic.  So it was easy to avoid eating out. Obviously I wouldn't be writing this post if I had not put a lot of that weight back on lol. 

I was hoping that someone could give me advice on how to keep it off.  I'm tired of yo-yo'ing.  I have lost weight again but slower this time.  I am down to 186 now and am working on staying on target.  How many calories can I eat if and when I reach my goal weight?  Since I am diabetic and have a slew of other health issues, I want to keep tracking even after I hit goal. 

P.S.  I have constant food noise in my head but I try to channel that into ideas for recipes that I share with friends or in creating baked goods for other people to eat.  Sucks when your hobby is baking but you can't eat any of it. I still love to bake even if I can't eat it. ",1767803289.0,2,11,loseit,weight_loss

1q6i8hw,I fainted for the first time a couple of weeks ago,"Hello. I have lost roughly 25 kg now. Still 1kg left before I’m no longer overweight according to the BMI scale. Weight loss has definitely been slowing down, especially after I upped my calories to 1200 or even 1400 on some more active days after struggling with lightheadedness. Lightheadedness was getting better, or so I thought.

One evening I ”woke up” on the floor. One of the kitchen chairs was on the floor next to me. My cats were starring at me. I had no idea what happened until I tried to get up and felt incredibly lightheaded. Was forced to lay down again. Figured I’d probably held on to the chair when feeling lightened earlier but it didn’t work and I fainted, taking the chair down with me. I had to crawl to the bathroom and brush my teeth laying down because I felt like I was going to faint when standing up. When I finally did stand up to get on to my bed my heart was beating so fast and my eyesight was fading away. I must have fallen asleep after that.

I haven’t been experienced it again since but the bruises I got when falling still hurt. And I still sometimes feel lightheaded.

I don’t know if I should tell anyone about this? I am eating enough, over 1200 kcal. Maybe it is stress related? Am I not drinking enough water? What is wrong? I don’t want to experience this again.

Edit: I am seeing my doctor in a few weeks or so to discuss test results for an unrelated issue. Will ask him then if this is something I should be worried about.",1767799475.0,1,32,loseit,weight_loss

1q6hebd,should I increase my calories?,"(tw: mention of previous unhealthy weight loss)

Hello everyone! My pants don't fit anymore so I decided it was time for me to lose weight lol. I started 3 days ago and let me be honest, I'm so EXHAUSTED. in all my previous experiences dieting I just starved myself and called it a ""diet"" but this year I decided I will do it in a healthy way. So I planned, I counted my calories and I meal-prepped, but still, it's not been even a week and I'm exhausted, in the sense I'm very tired and I really need a nap. Up to what point is it normal? like, since I've never lost weight in a healthy way I don't really have a baseline of how I am supposed to feel. I also have been waking up an hour earlier to go for a walk in the morning before my day starts, but I'm also going to bed an hour earlier. I'm so tired that when I sit down to work I can't concentrate for too long nor I have the will to do stuff. Am I eating too little? is this like an adaptation period?

I'd appreciate any advice.

edit: since someone asked I'll add my stats: I'm 170cm (I think that's 5'6 for the Americans?) and I weight 63kg (absolutely no idea how much that is in pounds, sorry).

1q6h6er,Losing weight (again): Those pants 2026 (and adventures),"I love buying second hand - it‘s often good quality, cheap but more sturdy than new clothes these days. Normally I like to wear dresses and skirts - freedom of movement and having like a huge blanket all the time is a plus for me. They cover well. Too well.

So I got myself a pants. Second-hand, something brandy. Good deal. I love hiking and I would love to do it more this year and a good trousers is nice to have (and also I‘d love to live a bit my adventure fantasy). I picked them up today. Tried them. They don‘t fit as well as they should - the size is right. I blinked into my mirror. Oh no.

Got on the scale, and alas - there were the kilos I thought I lost, mocking me for my bad life choices and an unhealthy liking to bell-pepper tasting salty snacks. I should cut those. 

——

So this is some kind of a weight loss diary. I‘m not doing well on goals when I keep them to myself, therefore I‘d like to trick myself in staying by putting myself in front of an audience. Hey to everyone who reads this!

I‘m 25, female, currently on 71kg (around 156 lbs I think), 1,73 m tall (5,6“ I guess). I lost weight in 2024 already, from 75kg to 63kg, which is definitely the weight I feel the most comfortable. Currently I‘m aiming for 65 to 63kg, maybe going down to 60. I also want to lose more fat and gain more muscles, to be prepared for my summer adventures. I‘ll use my pants and a scale for measurements (I know - the clothes should fit the person, not the person the clothes, but it‘s my other silly little motivation and I can‘t give them back and they are really nice pants so bear with me). It‘s also about having a better mindset - I‘m struggeling with completing things and avoid ending things too, so I want to tackle that habit, as well as trying to consume less, which also needs a lot of discipline. Two birds, one stone?

Also - I‘m eating a mostly plant based diet, so there will be a lot of beans. I‘m grateful for any tips regarding other protein sources. I‘ll document everything related every week in short form with a goal for the upcoming week (Wednesday to Wednesday). 



So my goal for week 1 is:

\- daily movement (either a workout, a run or a long, long walk)

\- drinking at least 2 litres of herbal tea and water, better 3

\- counting calories for a deficit 

\- no snackies other than gherkins because I currently like them and I will get sick of them soon enough

\- not buying new stuff, rather raiding my cabinets and freezer for food and stuff (got a lot of beans to use)



So, hopefully see you next week!

1q6gzpn,"[Progress Pics] F 36 (260 lbs - 190 lbs, and more to go). Here are some of my absolute favorite tips so far!","TW: BED (Binge Eating Disorder) and AUD (Alcohol Use Disorder)

Me: 
F 36, 5'6 | SW: 260 lbs (Jan 2025) | CW: 189 lbs (Jan 2026) | GW: 150-160ish? 

I started diligently tracking my calories about 11 months ago (Feb 2025), and although the scale showed progress (even if it seemed very slow from week to week), my body dysmorphia has prevented me from noticing much of a difference (which is funny because, at my largest, my body dysmorphia had me convinced that I looked fit and much smaller than I actually was). On top of that, it doesn't help at all that no one outside my immediate family has mentioned anything to me (and I know there could be so many reasons for this, but it makes it feel all the more insignificant).  Because I didn't feel or look that different to myself, I was looking for some reassurance, some acknowledgement... Or maybe just needed to take a step back to evaluate and reflect on my progress.

I know that I've come a very long way from last January in terms of my mindset and lifestyle (one of my biggest achievements being 11 months sober... Which has been a significant component of my weight loss, considering how much liquor I drank per week: 1.5-3 liters or 1-2 handles...oof- the calories alone, not to mention all of the other negative impacts). Another big component was realizing that I had BED... It was shocking to realize that not everyone has food noise 100% of the time, every minute of every day. I still struggle with this a lot, but am trying to heal my relationship with food... and it's something I actively try to acknowledge every single day.

I have never posted anything like this on Reddit before (and I feel insanely vulnerable in doing so), but I thought it would be nice to see photos of me at my starting weight and what I look like now, and maybe share them in hopes that they could motivate others... Especially because looking at other people's progress pictures has been one of my biggest motivators on this journey. As I reflect on this past year, I also thought it would be nice to share some tips that I feel were among the biggest factors in my progress so far. Hearing tips like these throughout my fitness journey were absolute game-changers for me, so maybe you'll find something useful for you as well.

Here is a link to my progress pics: 
https://imgur.com/a/N2oKmAT 
Stats: F 36, 5'6 SW: 260 lbs CW: 189 lbs GW: 150-160 lbs (11 month progress).

Disclaimer: the following tips are only based on MY personal experience, and should not be substituted for professional advice that is personalized to YOUR health and long-term goals. I just wanted to share, in case you find any of them helpful to try out.

Here are my top 5 tips (that worked for me, specifically):

1. Pre-enter all of your meals for the next day on the night before. (Tracking calories was essential for me, but deciding what to eat on the day of, especially if I had to prepare it that day was so daunting, that it led to many bad decisions of meal choices that were not as nutritious or satisfying). Knowing what I was planning to eat took all the guesswork out of it, and let me not worry about every single meal because I knew what I was planning to eat, which would be more satisfying than ordering something while I was starving, and making decisions that were not great for my goals. 

2. Let yourself indulge, but be mindful about it. I let myself have something on the more indulgent side on a regular basis (at least weekly, often daily), especially if it was something I had been craving for a while. I tried to balance out the more indulgent choices to create well-rounded meals by adding protein, vegetables, etc. This made it so that no foods were absolutely off-limits, and made for a more sustainable lifestyle mindset as opposed to a short term mentality. You can't just go back to your old ways after you lose the weight or you'll gain it back (and I'm never ever going back), you need to eat in a way that you think you can maintain for life... Especially for long-term success. Everything is guilt-free, because guilt is not an ingredient. Don't label food items as 'dirty' or 'clean' because that is often a misleading and uninformed (not to mention, privileged) way of looking at food, and you can still make healthy and sustainable progress, eating what is available to you.

3. Understand your patterns, and work them into your lifestyle. One thing that I realized was that I always felt hungry just before bed, and wanted to eat ""second dinner"" every night, right before dessert. Knowing that I would want second dinner, I would portion out my dinner based on my pre-entered meal, and take 1/3 - 1/2 of the plate and put it aside for later. This was a great way to stay within my goals, but also feel like I got to indulge a little bit every single day. It made me feel far more satisfied, and far less uncomfortable than if I had consumed the entire meal in one sitting. This also helped me realize that I was eating far beyond the point of satiety, and often pushing past discomfort and being overly full to the point of pain and nausea (I know now that this is BED, and I'm still trying to actively work on this every single day). I knew that I would enjoy the rest of that food much more at ""second dinner"" then if I ate all of it in one sitting... And boy was it at exciting to open my fridge and realize I had more to eat that was already accounted for in my calorie goals! 

4. A food scale will be your best friend, and it will hurt your feelings. I have tracked calories before, many many MANY times... But did not consistently lose weight. The truth was that I was never actually measuring my portions, I was eyeballing them. The first time I weighed out a serving of rice, or peanut butter, or condiments, I was absolutely shocked by how far off my 'eyeball estimates' were. I was eating 2-3 times what I thought I was, without having any idea why I wasn't making progress. Once you get in the habit of using a food scale, you get better at estimating, because you have a better understanding of the volume of portions. That being said, I have a travel food scale, because I still don't quite trust my estimates. 

5. Always track it, even if you don't feel like it (and even if you didn't eat according to plan). This was especially helpful because it gave me the mindset that I wasn't going to derail all my progress in one or a few days. It also helped hold me accountable and made me more mindful. I let myself eat at (or above) maintenance periodically, especially if I had been feeling a little discouraged and/or extra hungry. I enjoyed holidays and celebrations, birthdays and dinners with friends, all while trying my best to still track my calories (eating what felt good and exciting, and knowing that no matter what it was, I wouldn't be afraid of it, and it wouldn't derail months of progress). Tracking everything also helped me realize how certain foods impact my mood, the scale, and my energy levels. Overtime, this helped me choose options that would satisfy my mind and my body, without feeling physically uncomfortable afterwards. Consistency is far more important than perfection, always!

I'm hoping that 1 or more of these might help you in some way, and even if they don't, know that progress is measured by the little things: a mindset shift, not being afraid of certain foods, higher energy levels, healthier choices every day, and tons of little victories (even if you don't notice as much on the scale/mirror, and your progress is slower than you'd like). 

If you have any game-changing tips that have helped you on your journey, please share those- I would love to hear them!

1q6g2x3,Food when seeing friends?,"I'm unemployed and I'm taking this opportunity to catch up with friends and family.

Obviously that doesn't happen every time and they might feed me whatever food they've prepared. And while I'm grateful for free food, I have difficulty tracking the foods.

Hi everyone. I hope it’s okay to share something a bit personal here.

Lately I’ve been having a really hard time with my body image. Looking in the mirror has become painful, and my thoughts about myself have been getting more and more negative. I’m trying to lose weight in a healthy way, but these feelings are making it difficult to stay on track without falling into extremes.

I have a history of an eating disorder (bulimia) and recently an unexpected conversation brought a lot of old fears back to the surface. A friend told me, with good intentions and as a joke, that the pharmaceutical company he works for has received approval to start producing GLP-1 medication. He knows I want to lose weight, so he asked if I’d like some “on the side,” the way we’ve jokingly talked about ibuprofen or melatonin before. 

I’m sure he meant nothing with it, he was just making light and ""funny"" conversation flexing his job, but hearing that completely triggered me. Now I feel stuck between different impulses: part of me wants the joke-offer to be a real opportunity (you can't get n GLP-1 without a prescription in my country) because I’m desperate to change my body, another part wants to keep trusting the diet and the slow process, and the darkest part of my mind is getting pulled toward my old behaviors as a way to cope with the anxiety and shame.

I don’t want to return to the person I was when my eating disorder controlled my life, yet the urge is getting louder. I’m not looking for medical advice or quick fixes. I just really need to talk to someone who might understand, to vent and feel less alone in this.

If any of you have dealt with similar struggles while trying to improve your health—and while resisting unhealthy or unsafe “solutions”—I would be grateful to hear your experiences or simply have a conversation.

1q6f70r,Worried about incoming gains,"Just in need of a little reassurance. I do intermittent fasting, I don’t eat evening meals as I’m often just not that hungry and end up not eating anything between 6pm-7am most days of the week (on the odd occasion when I am hungry I do eat evening meals, I’m not just starving myself, I eat normal for the rest of the day). This has really worked for me, not just with a steady loss of 2lbs per month, but I no longer feel bloated when I wake in the mornings.

Except I’m now on antibiotics for the next week for a staph infection and I have to take them 4 times a day with food. Don’t get me wrong I’m not thinking of skipping them or the food with them, but I am feeling down because I know when I eat late the scale either doesn’t budge or goes in the wrong direction. 

I did so well not gaining weight over Christmas and I’m worried this will set me back. I gain weight so easy and it takes me so long to shed it. I feel quite pants ",1767792081.0,0,17,loseit,weight_loss
1q6d8py,Is weight loss truly the fastest shortcut to beauty? I need a reality check.,"I don't have the guts for plastic surgery, so I’ve spent years mastering the art of makeup and skincare instead. I’ve gotten to the point where my skills are transformative my friends always ask me for tips and tutorials.

But deep down, I know the truth: this ""beauty"" only exists at specific angles through a phone camera. In reality (IRL), I’m constantly battling with my weight. Over the last year or two, it’s gotten out of control. I can contour my face, but I can't hide the reality of my body spilling out of my clothes. It’s made me want to leave the house less and less, turning into a vicious cycle.

Recently, people around me have been hinting (or straight up saying) that makeup is just a mask, and that losing weight is the ultimate glow-up. I’m struggling. I know they are probably right, but the process of losing weight feels so painful and daunting.

Can someone give me a push? I need evidence or personal stories. Please convince me that the struggle is worth it ,is weight loss really the biggest game-changer for appearance?",1767786273.0,541,265,loseit,weight_loss
1q6d1ul,Gained 4lbs this week damn,"25, M, 266 (began 275, last week was 262), 5’11 and a half. 

Basically I managed to get through Christmas period quite well. Took some days (night out before Xmas and XMAS day itself off counting) off, and the others I managed alright. I lost LESS, like half a pound a week instead of 2lbs which is what I was getting before.

Now New Year’s Eve and the 1st I took off, which was the right call BUT since then I’ve been eating just a bit more and I don’t know why?? Like it’s been very tough getting fully back into it. I still record it all and write in my weight loss triggers journal but I can’t quite figure it out rn. I just WANT to eat shit?

Like my cravings for anything are just off the chart rn. Anyway, today was my weigh-in and I knew it was gonna be bad but yeah- I’ve gained 4lbs. Now maybe that’s not fully accurate, maybe I’d get back on to weight loss and next week find some of that was wrong or water weight BUT I shouldn’t take it like that at all rn.

I’m just very frustrated but perhaps it could be a good thing, it’s my first time it’s gone up and I knew it would since I began this diet this time round. Like a good thing as it’s a time where I can see this thing that hurts me emotionally but I can overcome it and leave it in its dust eventually through perseverance.

I’ve signed up for a 5K that is end of May, so I’ve got plenty of time to lose more weight and train for it, and figured it’d be perfect for motivation to keep going outside of just dieting. 

I guess the main issue is, I don’t know how to not WANT these cravings. I wish I could say what I’m craving but it’s nothing in particular. The worst culprit I suppose is crisps, always is, those bastards could be consumed by the truckload. Like Christ is tricky.

Maybe just this week I don’t eat any processed snacks at all?? And I want it figure out best times to eat different types of food at different types of day.

Like after waking up is carbs or protein better, is it better to eat most calories earlier in day, what do I eat before and post running, etc.

1q6csyh,Super hard losing belly fat?,"I'm 22M try to be consistent in the gym. I haven't yet incorporate cardio in my program but I plan to.

I'm not even in a caloric deficit I don't count calories but I feel like I'm not even reaching my maintenance calories with the way I'm eating every day 

I'm lazy I wake up usually afternoon and wouldn't eat for a few hours after I wake up. I usually have coffee first and when I have my first meal it's just two eggs with some stuff inside with one slice of bread. After that it's usually close to dinner time I'll have a more substantial meal so I usually have one small meal first then a heavier meal after.

So I know I'm not even reaching 1000+ that's even lower than if I were to track my on a deficit. how come I still have belly fat? 

When I do track or decided to go on a deficit should I maybe go on a keto diet or try cardio more often ?",1767784789.0,0,21,loseit,weight_loss
1q6cox9,Dating while on a weight loss journey?,"Hi lose it fam.

I previously lost about 100lbs and gained most of it back—currently working on restoring my former better eating habits and losing the weight again. It’s daunting. But what’s even more daunting is trying to find a partner. I am 32f, 5’5, and currently 250lbs. I realize I let my weight keep me from actively pursuing things I want in life, including finding a romantic partner. I know I should seek therapy for this because anyone is deserving of love and other good things in life at any size. BUT I also feel like finding a partner who understands the struggle of extreme weight loss and maintenance is not going to be easy… 

I guess I am looking for advice, encouragement, or to hear I’m not alone in this predicament. Dating over 30 is rough enough as it is and I just feel like my added weight management baggage will make finding a partner impossible.

I am not overweight and have been working out for 6-ish years now, I have stubborn fat in my belly, otherwise no fat anywhere else.

Over the years I have tried cutting and bulking, going up and down in a range of 67kg to 86kg

I assume I would have to go down to something like 65kg to not see it and maybe 60kg to see abs.. But by then I wouldn't have any muscle amymore.

1q69xg0,Does anyone else feel like fixing food noise just replaces it with more rules?,"I have been thinking more about food noise lately, and it made me notice something weird in my own weight loss journey.

A lot of the things that do reduce food noise for me, like strict meal plans, tracking everything, prepping days in advance, eating the same foods etc. actually work, but they come with a different kind of mental load.

It’s like I’m not obsessing about food choices anymore, but I’m constantly managing a system instead. Logging, planning, staying on track, worrying about breaking the routine. When the routine breaks (vacation/holidays), the noise comes right back.

It makes me wonder whether the real issue isn’t food itself, but how much thinking and self-monitoring eating starts to require once you’re trying to do it “right"". I remember when eating used to be automatic, like just eating when I felt hungry, and not having to stick to or maintain anything.

For those of you who’ve found something that actually helped long-term:  
Did it make eating feel more automatic again or did it just give you a structure you have to constantly maintain?",1767774202.0,118,18,loseit,weight_loss
1q69rvq,Emotional after weight loss,"At my heaviest i weighed about 284 lbs and i felt like i had to lose weight because it was a big problem. My first attempt in losing weight i lost about 10-15 lbs in two months but i was not satisfied with the results so i had a goal weight of 230 but it ultimately failed as i quit sports and kept eating junk which kept me at 250 lbs.

note:im in High school still

I kept my whole sophomore year at 240lbs to 250lbs so i decided to lose weight while im not doing sports so i had much time to do it. i reached the weight of 220lbs but i starved myself doing it so i lost muscle which does not look good while being 220 lbs. i decided to buy a  gym membership in hopes of changing for the better. i started off doing well while taking protein and creatine, i gained about 10 lbs from it but i thought it was muscle but one day i had severe appendicitis and had to get my appendix removed. this caused my progress to completely derail and made me start from zero.After i recovered from about a month or two, i started running as a hobby because it was very fun for me, as i kept running i saw the weight shredding off like crazy and hitting 3-4 mile runs every morning. This is the peak of my life , and after a while i weighed myself and i weighed 183 lbs and i cried genuine tears of joy because i had been overweight my whole life. i hope the people who read this gets motivated to start their journey and that no obstacle is too great for one to get over.

I’m 5’2 (157.48 cm) and about 129.8 lbs (58.88 kg) I gained nearly a whole 10 pounds over winter break and I really want to fix that

I have a lot of mental health issues that make motivation hard for me and I used to starve and make myself throw up on and off from the ages of 11-15 but because I’d also binge randomly I never lost the weight for long

I also have arfid so my food option are very scarce… I only have 3 dinner options for example and sometimes I get sick of them and just end up not eating because of it.

So because of my arfid and past struggles with food, going on a diet is not an option. I’m in therapy for arfid but unfortunately that’s not helping but I digress.

I also do not have much vitamins in my body so I have to take pills for those and idk if that will affect my ability to lose weight.

What I have started to do is eat a calorie deficit of 1,000 calories or less a day, walk 10,000 steps a day, I do 16:8 intermittent fasting, and I found a 7 min Pilates vid that I will do daily as well.

Am I doing the right things or do I need to do something else? I’m looking to lose the weight by spring, or at the very latest, summer. Please help, thanks.

When I try to help and encourage them, they get frustrated and annoyed with all the insisting.

What I haven't tried, is doing exercise with them rather then being on the sidelines which is what I would like to try.

My issue is that I'm underweight. I would like to do all exercises(If possible) that is needed to help my friend's motivation and to do right next to them. But because I'm overweight and weak, will I be able to do the same exercises as them? Can I do them and instead gain weight like muscle fat?

This can depend on diet which is a whole other thing, that one I understand more on so I'm already planning that part.

The main goal so it bring the motivation and joy to them for they can keep moving forward. With this new year, I am determined to accomplish their goal from last years.

1q66fbt,Having trouble getting over plateau.,"I am 35M, 5'9, weighing 218 lbs. I started my weight loss journey in 2024 Feb. I used to weight 248lbs. I was ready for slow grind and lost 5 lbs every month. By Dec 2024, I lost 45 lbs and was weighing around 202lbs. I took 130-160 gms protein every day. Made sure that I stayed on calorie deficit with eating around 1800-2000 cal/day. I workout 4 times/day. I burnt around 3000 cal during my workout days. I rarely used to have cheat days. My A1C came down, my cholesterol came down and T increased to good level. My fat % came down from 45 to 32. But then I hit plateau in Jan 2025. I was never able to go below 200 lbs. I tried everything, increased my workouts, started eating less, I used to eat under 1500 cal/day. That's where it started to get worse. My cravings increased, got constant migraines and used to get tired easily during my workouts. I was suggested that I need a break and took 3 month break. And during this period I gained 20 lbs. My fat % increased from 32 to 37%. And now even after getting back to my usual workouts and calorie deficit I'm still finding it tough to lose weight. I recently hired a trainer who mentioned that it could be because of genetics. Even though it's true, it sucks to hear that after all the work I did I had to gain my weight back.

In this case don’t ever say that you gained 0.2kg in 4 days , you should take the average of these 4 days / 5 days and consider it as your base weight. Keep doing that and I can assure you that if you’re 100% committed to your diet / meal timing you will never ever see any increase in rolling average

“WATER”

Most of the weight fluctuation is caused by water and how your body holds it, I’m not saying you need to drink 3 or 4L a day, but just keep an eye on your pee color and make sure it’s almost white

I am required to take medication that causes me to gain weight, and actually eat relatively healthy, but gained weight during the pandemic and life thereafter.

1q64i4s,Is it strange that Weight Watchers works much better for me than Calorie Counting?,"I have experience in using both strategies and despite calorie counting being more strict and rigid in nature, I actually think Weight Watchers makes you feel more in-tune and in control with your body when it comes to weight loss. 

With Calorie Counting, what happens if you've used up all your calories for the day but you still feel hungry? Aw too bad for you. 

With Weight Watchers, I can curb the hunger by eating one of many ""Zero-Point"" foods until the hunger goes away. If I still feel hungry after a meal, I'll eat an Apple. If I still feel hungry, I'll have a Banana after. If I'm still not physically or mentally satisfied when it comes to hunger, I'll eat a can of Salmon. I ate because I was genuinely hungry and I ate Zero-Point foods just so the hunger would go away. I didn't binge or eat an unreasonable amount of food.

The key to losing weight on WW is building an entire menu comprised of Zero Point Foods. If your entire menu comprises of mostly Zero Point Foods, it'll be impossible not to lose weight. 

The idea that you won't lose weight if majority of your diet comprises of food like Apples, Bananas, Salads, Sardines, Sweet Potatoes, Salmon, Egg White, Tuna, and 0% Greek Yogurt is completely ridiculous. It's impossible to not lose weight if your diet is 90% Zero Point Foods.

Hello, I am a 18 year old female who has recently gained a bit of unwanted weight. I have never been considered fat or overweight but after my first semester in college i noticed my stomach and back fat increasing. I have always had a bigger stomach, meaning i never had a flat stomach even when I had abs. I usually walk 10k a day and workout 3-4 times a week. However I think my eating kills me since i love sweets and often feel like i am overeating or binge eating. The food noise is apparent but only when i want to start to lose weight again, meaning when i don’t think about eating a lot i don’t eat but when i think about restricting myself I eat even more than before when I didn’t think about it.

1q63od2,Weight loss advice,"Hey everyone,

I’m looking for some advice because I’m a bit out of my depth here.

My girlfriend is 149 cm, \~67 kg, and her goal is to lose body fat. We’ve been going to the gym 3–4 times a week, mainly doing weight training, and she’s been consistent with workouts. Strength-wise she’s improving, but fat loss has been slow or inconsistent.

The main issue seems to be nutrition. She struggles with tracking food consistently and finds calorie counting overwhelming or hard to maintain long term. I’ve personally never had issues with fat gain and dieting isn’t too mentally taxing to me, so I don’t want to give her bad advice or come across as pushy or clueless.

I’m wondering:

	•	Is strict calorie tracking necessary, or are there more sustainable alternatives?

	•	Are there simple habits or rules of thumb that work well for shorter women?

	•	Should we be prioritising steps/cardio alongside weights?

	•	Any mindset or approach tips to make fat loss less stressful?

1q63g2f,Advice on CICO for someone who has experienced disordered eating (TW),"Hey there, 31F here, 169cm (5’7) around 80kg (175lbs). 

Possibly unnecessary details, sorry for the length:

I’ve had many weight fluctuations throughout my life and have had issues with binge-eating (most severe ages 10-20) and bulimia (ages 17-25 with a several month relapse in 2024) for long periods. 

Highest weight was 93kg (age 16) and lowest weight was 57kg (age 22). I then went back up to 82kg (age 25) and back down to 72kg (age 27). 

I lost a lot of weight very quickly in my late teens using very unhealthy methods. It took me many years to repair my relationship with food but I suffer from loose skin and stretch marks due to the choices I’ve made. 

I used to have a very active job with strict break times and was really invested in healthy meal prepping. However 3 years ago I injured myself and I have not recovered. I have gained around 8kg (17lbs) since then. 

I had surgery on the injury 6 weeks ago and have been very sedentary since. I am very self-conscious of my weight and it affects my relationship and also my day-to-day activities. It is summer where I am and I’m too insecure to wear shorts or go swimming. 

I eat primarily organic whole foods but am definitely eating too much for my current activity abilities. As of recently I’m able to walk again so I’m trying to hit 10k steps per day. 

I’m aware that CICO is the most obviously effective way to lose fat and would love to implement something so logical but I’m afraid that trying to will send me down a dark path. 

In 2024 while experiencing great stress & PTSD I started purging again which I never expected to do. I have quite a negative body image and being controlling about what I eat can really take a toll on me mentally and lead to additional binging. 

Does anyone who has suffered from an eating disorder have experience with later in life counting calories and successfully losing weight without triggering a relapse?

Looking for any advice or tips to proceed with weight loss in the most positive way possible, without shattering the small amount of self-esteem I’ve built up and used to stop engaging in bulimia. 

Thank you in advance!

My overall weight has been great most of my life. However, one issue I have struggled with, especially after puberty (now 21) is face fat. I have large cheeks and a lot of chin fat/multiple chins. 

Unfortunately this led to me developing unhealthy habits to try and lose the fat. In the end it didn’t even do anything as I was a horrible colour and looked permanently tired/sick due to the diet. I have now got back to healthy eating habits for a few years but my face is so incredibly large and I have 0 idea why.

1q61e8z,I HATE cooking.,"I've been trying to lose weight for about seven months, but I keep struggling because of my eating choices, mostly because I do not cook at home.

The ironic part is that my cooking is actually pretty good and I get a lot of praise for it, but I genuinely do not enjoy it at all. Cooking brings me zero joy. It feels like the worst chore imaginable. 

This has been the cycle: I force myself to cook, and eventually I stop because of how much I hate it. It literally ruins my day. And trust me, I tried to make it easy and simple. I even bought an air fryer and tried meal prepping and slow cooking, but I hate all of it. Even thinking about cooking feels completely draining.

I tried writing down why I hate cooking so much, and here is what I came up with.
The number one reason is deciding what to eat. That alone is incredibly frustrating. I cannot eat the same thing repeatedly. If I do, I actually feel nauseated. Because of that, coming up with something to cook every day feels like a complete nightmare. Even when I look online for ideas, I get nowhere. There is always a problem: I do not have most of the ingredients, there are too many steps, or I am just not in the mood for it.
The second major reason is that I truly despise the act of cooking itself. I do not enjoy it at all. The moment I start, I am just waiting for it to be over. I would also like to mention that I tried frozen meals, but they are not filling, and I get tired of them very quickly.

Because of all this, I always end up buying food instead, which of course has not helped me lose weight and has also become very expensive.

I honestly do not know what to do anymore. I feel so helpless and angry with myself. I keep asking why I am like this. I am an adult, so I feel like I should not struggle this much. Sometimes I honestly wish I lived with someone who loved to cook and enjoyed doing it all the time, because that would solve everything. When I was younger, I never had to worry about food.

I'm a 5ft 2 girl and like 124 kg as a result of a BED. I'm 2 years recovered and still seeing a counsellor every week to talk about everything. 

The thing is... my BED was caused by my mum putting me on diets from fairly young. Even though I had little to no interest and didn't care if I was fat. Now if I even hear the words calorie deficit, calorie counting, dieting - I know that's not sustainable for me and could lead to a relapse.

I’m travelling at the first of July.

I do not drink alcohol and haven’t really tried to do anything with my weight before.
I have a gym membership and used to be massive before. Can someone help me set a plan to lose weight consistently until then. 

I will ofc focus on building muscle too, so the 20-30kg (44-66lbs) lost can also be replaced with muscles.


My biggest weaknesses right now is
1. mom makes very very good food, but very very unhealthy.
2. I do have a lot of disposable income and buy whatever I want whenever I want. (Or more like I can’t stop my cravings).
3. when I’m at the gym I never hit cardio, I only train upper body. Well I haven’t trained consistently in a very long time now, about 2-3 years. But when I do train here and there I only hit upper body.


Any tips/plans are welcomed and any questions are welcomed and will be answered.

Goal is 70kg (155lbs). But anything heavier with muscles will work.


Edit 1. thanks for the advice. I guess the weight goal is not the main thing I’m looking at. I’m trying to get in shape, you know, looking more normal even if my weight is still high.

1q5wiqq,Does this calculator take into account plateaus?,"I found this calculator in an old Reddit post and plugged in my values. If you look using your own values, it says if you eat the same amount of calories for months on end, your TDEE will decrease overtime (a smaller body requires less calories to burn) and the deficit becomes smaller, but you can still reach your goal weight by just eating the same calories for months and months, assuming activity level stays the same. According to this calculator, then, I wouldn’t hit a plateau until June 2027, when my calorie deficit would be 100-200 within my TDEE, and weight loss would slow significantly. I have read (and experienced though) that you can plateau sooner than that, so if that’s the case, is this calculator really accurate and how do I identify when I am likely to plateau?

More whole food and veggies based?

( Sorry this might be long)
Hello all! I hope this doesn’t get lost in the new years influx of posts (I’m no better) but here it goes. Before now, I’ve been relatively skinny my whole life, did gymnastics for a while in elementary and middle, then travelled doing competitive dance a few times a week in middle and Highschool. Unfortunately, when I was 22, a bad relationship and more specifically a (prescribed) medication had me eating 2x the amount I should have. I went from 125lbs to 190 in a year. I stopped gaining weight as soon as I got off the med, but the damage had been done. Then for the year after I was focusing heavily on graduating and on weekly therapy to work through a lot of things, and I don’t regret taking that year for my mental health. But honestly, I’m tired of being overweight. It’s jarring for me to look in the mirror and see my body when I’ve always been skinny. My self esteem is a lot better, but I just want to look like myself again. I know I’ll probably never be the perfect tiny 21 year old, but getting closer to 140 pounds (preferably 130) would be ideal. The problem is, I’ve never had to work out before. Being a teen it was just built into my schedule. Even when I stopped sports for two years in college, I didn’t gain any weight until starting to take the medication. For what I do for exercise now, I love swimming laps and can swim for up to an hour at a time (with breaks of course) but I’m not consistent like I should be. To add variety I’m looking to also try strength training because I want a plan for when the pool isn’t available. My goal is preferably 3x a week workout after work or weekends, but I have some questions and am asking for suggestions. My main insecurities are belly fat and my double chin. I just want to feel petit again and not short and stout hahahaha. 

1. Is swimming laps enough as a workout 3x a week, or is there more I could be doing/should I be doing regular gym things?

2. What machines target belly and face most? I know face is obviously harder to target than nelly hahaha. 

3. I am nervous about a long term calorie deficit because I’ve restricted in the past and overeating has never been my issue (minus when on the former medication). This might be dumb but Is it possible to eat in a deficit until I get my goal weight and then go back to my current eating habits which maintain whatever weight I’m currently at? 

4. What are your tips for staying consistent? Do you have any success stories? 

After graduating college I know that I can do anything I put my mind to, I’m just so afraid of failure that I haven’t really put any effort in. But I want to look like myself again so I’m starting here by saying it out loud. Okay thanks for reading.

1q5v9ug,Stationary Bike Recommendations,"Hello all, 

I've been thinking about purchasing a stationary bike to start some cardio. I have a newer job with a little bit less activity and was wondering what the absolute beginner bike is that's not super cheap either. Any recommendations would be helpful. It's harder to find one that's middle ground without knowing too much about them. I'd say my budget is probably no more than $400, maybe $450.

I've been looking at the Echelon Connect Sport 2 Bike, Indoor Cycling + 30-Day Trial, Compact and Foldable Frame at Walmart for $198. This doesn't seem good quality to me though. 

I was hoping anyone could give me some feedback about these bikes due to me being an absolute beginner and really want to hit something hard before I start biking this spring outside. 

It seems to me my only options are something off brand, the one I mentioned earlier, or a $2,000 - $3,000 Peloton. I really want to find something I'll like without sending too much or too little if that makes sense. I'm always a middle of the road buyer. I feel like that fixes the quality issues and the overspending issues. ",1767734047.0,2,7,loseit,weight_loss

1q5ue72,My body feels like pudding and I’m losing patience - looking for advice,"**!LONG POST!**

**ABOUT ME**  
I’m 26 years old (turning 27 this year).  
183 cm, around 80 kg.

I returned to my home country about 1.5 years ago and now work a sedentary desk job. Before that, I lived and worked in the Netherlands for about 1.5 years as well, mostly standing work in a factory (not heavy labor).

My fitness journey started around age 20, when I couldn’t even carry grocery bags properly or do a single push-up. I started running.

Now I can run around 8 km in about 45 minutes and do regular push-ups, diamond push-ups, even one-arm push-ups.

The problem is that none of this seems to translate into the physique I expect.

I’ve never wanted an Instagram body or to be huge. I just want a lean, slim build with some definition. Instead, my body looks soft. From the front especially, it feels like pudding.

**WEIGHT AND DIET CONFUSION**  
When I came back in August 2024, my weight started going up through 2025, which really shocked me.

In the Netherlands I smoked weed regularly, ate a lot of sweets, burgers and junk food, yet I was very lean and wore size XS or sometimes S.

Now I cook all my meals myself, avoid processed food and followed the “Glucose Revolution” diet. A coworker of mine lost 20 kg on it. Despite this, I now wear M or even L.

Since summer 2025 I’ve been doing full-body dumbbell training every other day with 7.5 kg dumbbells. I also run 8 km or swim around 40 minutes (breaststroke, mostly for my back and posture), and I cycle to work daily, about 15 minutes one way.

Since early 2025 this has been my lifestyle, yet my weight keeps going up.

For the last two months I’ve been even stricter. I stick to the same diet principles, train regularly, take protein and creatine, eat only home-cooked meals, and allow myself one cheat per week, either a kebab or a homemade four-cheese pizza.

I do see some changes. My chest is bigger, my arms are bigger, and my abs and obliques are slightly visible.

But when I sit down, I get folds. From the front, my belly looks soft. Overall, I feel bloated and doughy.

Sometimes I feel like crying, because I honestly think an average guy training this much would look athletic or lean by now. I feel like I look more like a baby than an Adonis.

**RELEVANT PERSONAL INFO**  
I take 0.5 mg clonazepam daily due to an accidental dependency and I am currently tapering off, close to the end.  
I struggle with anxiety and depressive episodes.  
I don’t drink alcohol at all and I’ve never smoked cigarettes.  
I smoke weed a few times a week.  
My blood sugar was tested and is normal.  
A doctor said my testosterone is probably fine since I have beard growth, completed puberty and have libido.

**FINAL THOUGHTS**  
I’m exhausted and confused. I also try to eat a lot of protein, around 2 g per kilogram of body weight. I avoid sugar and processed food. I’ve wondered whether weed could be part of the issue, but I don’t binge eat when I use it. I also don’t know if it could really have such a big impact that I end up looking skinny-fat instead of just lean and tidy.

A year ago, I decided to start working out consistently after the worst fitness year of my life. I could barely use the stationery bike to go 2-3 miles and I was so tired. 

Yesterday, I went 18 miles on the bike and I still don’t feel bad afterwards. I weigh 40 pounds less than I did a year ago and am back in my healthy BMI range. And I still traveled, enjoyed wine and cake, and took a maintenance break for the holidays + didn’t gain anything back without tracking.

A year into my fitness journey, I’m so happy I stuck with it. It doesn’t need to be miserable or overly-strict, and working out has so much joy in it. It gets easier when you stick with it, too!

1q5thxa,Losing weight as a short woman,"Fellow short women, what is your experience with weight loss? 

I am 5' 2"" and started out at 133lbs in November of 2024. I am now at 119lbs, so I am averaging around a pound a month. I've noticed a trend where I will lose three-ish pounds in a short period of time (two weeks or so), but then my weight stagnates for couple of months before shedding another seemingly random three pounds. Is that normal?

I am a fulltime student and have a remote job, so my lifestyle is naturally sedentary but I still manage to get over 10k steps in a day. As far as calorie intake, I average around 1,200. I am a vegetarian, so I almost exclusively eat whole foods (not that there aren't vegetarians that eat junk food, there are plenty that do). I mostly eat vegetables, fruits, tofu, eggs, beans, nuts, and other simple stuff like that. 

I know smaller people lose weight slower, but I can't help but feel like my progress is slower than what it should be. I'd like to reach around 110lbs by June.

1q5t7x1,First NSV of the year!,"20 FTM 5'3"" 179lbs.

Started my journey about two months ago, and have hit one of my big non scale goals! 

Two years ago, I got myself some new jeans for Christmas as my old ones had all worn out. Wore them for a year and a half, gaining weight all the while, and stretching them out as I went lol. What started out as a 32"" waist wound up closer to a 34. 

From May to August 2025, I stopped wearing them entirely (because... summer) and come September I was totally incapable of squeezing into them. Ended up buying new jeans.... 36"" waist.

Well over the past month I've been noticing my jeans sliding down easier and easier, to the point where it's become genuinely inconvenient to wear them without a tightly cinched belt, and putting anything in the pockets was becoming downright dangerous for fear of accidentally pantsing myself.

So today I tried on my old broken-in jeans again. They fit again! They're as tight now as my 36s were two months ago when I was at my heaviest (about 191 lbs). As I continue to lose weight and change shape I'm sure they'll fit me even more comfortably. 

I'm so proud of my progress guys. I can't believe it's been two months already... I feel like I've just started. Christmastime was a bit stressful but I just kept reminding myself that a couple of days eating at my TDEE and not below it wouldn't undo progress but rather just maintain me where I was. That helped a lot.

I've not been doing much to shed weight. mostly just trying to walk a few times a week and eat under my TDEE. I'm honestly surprised at how quickly the changes came about... two months have flown by. With a new (and more flexible) class schedule I'm hoping to be able to work in more gym time this semester. I don't go often (istg like once a month) but every time I do I remember just how much fun it is! Getting the endorphins flowing feels good!!! 

Next goal: Go back to my old (and favourite) belt. The one I've been using since the spring just isn't the same :/ If I go down another hole size, I'll be small enough to pull out my old one again!",1767729633.0,5,1,loseit,weight_loss

I have previously lost 35lbs by following a calorie counting diet, but that was when I was in my 20s. Why do I lack belief in this plan working now?

I've been on the diet for about 4 days and haven't seen a single shift in my weight.

1q5qpde,Question about Calorie Counting,"Hello! 
28 female
5 feet 3 inches
Sw: 240ish
Cw: 209

Last year, I pretty much overhauled my diet, and began treatment for ADHD (which helped with boredom eating and meal planning). Went from eating out everyday to making my meals at home a majority of the time. I did try counting calories for a few months but stopped as it was too much mental work on top of fulltime employment and full time college.

However, in reviewing my weight loss trends over the last year, I noticed the period that I was counting calories that I lost *less* weight than before or after. I was hoping for some insight as to why this would be? I was aiming for a min of 1200 and a max of 1500 calories per day. I weighed everything with a scale, and I vary rarely use oil as I tend to poach, boil or bake.

Was I doing something wrong when counting? I was more hungry then than I am just eating regularly. And if I counted what I eat now, I'm 95% sure it would be more than 1500 calories. That doesnt make sense from a CICO standpoint.

I'll put a link to the graph. The yellow highlight is when I was counting. The red highlight was the holidays where I was eating more cal dense foods that I do not normally eat. The whole period I've been on the same meds, same activity level, and same foods. The only difference was that I weighed my food and counted cals in the yellow zone.

1q5qfwl,I'm training for hiking but it's stalling my weight loss,"I'm 40/F/165cm and have lost 20lbs so far, SW 232, CW 212, with a 1650 cal per day program.  The whole reason for my weight loss journey is to reduce pressure on my knees which have been bothering me of late and impeding my ability to pursue my passion for hiking.

I have worked a physio type workout into my week and have greatly improved my knee pain.  I was successfully losing about 1.5lbs a week and decided to get a walking pad so I could increase my walking stamina in advance of Spring.  I was doing short low speed intervals while I worked my sedintary job, like 20 mins at 2 mph about 4 times in 4 hours. Really low impact.

The trouble I'm running into is I can't maintain my calorie deficit with this type of exercise.  I burn enough calories that I'm ravenously hungry overnight and it keeps me awake until I have a snack (been going for 75g 0% fat Greek yogurt and 20g rolled oats).  As such, I've increased my calories per day to more like 1850.  I figured this could be a short term thing in the winter to maintain my weight a few months and get through the worst of this godawful season that gets my mood down, then return to my 1650 cal routine in Spring.  Adding calories has helped with the seasonal blues.

Here's the trouble: I can now walk much faster and farther than when I started, so I am therefore burning more calories and using more glycogen, and my body is begging for calorie replacement.  With the increased walking stamina, which was my whole goal, my calorie deficit is impractical to maintain if I want to sleep more than 4 hours a night.  My body is apparently quite sensitive to night hunger.

I could opt for less walking and more strength training to continue aiming towards strong knees for my hiking goals this summer, I suppose.  I love the walking, especially as it really improves my ADHD issues while I work (the walking is amazing for my focus), but it's getting in the way of my weight loss goals.

What is y'all's advice.  Do you think I should pivot away from walking so much since I have to eat for maintenance in order to do so (I'm doing about 15 miles a week)?  And if so, do y'all have any favorite strength routines that will help me train for a summer of hiking?

My scale has not budged. I’ll swing between 197-202 depending on what I’ve eaten. My job is allover the place, my schedule has been chaotic (flight attendant). I haven’t really found my way back to my groove and think I’m maintaining purely because Ive learned better portion control. 

I woke up today exhausted from 13 hours of flight, canceled my Pilates class and slept til noon weighed myself- 202. I just want  to cry. I’m considering trying glp1s, which Ive so far been opposed to after watching a family member develop serious gallbladder issues from. I just feel hopeless against my lack of willpower.

Another moment that really sealed it for me was a random comment from a regular food stall owner saying I’ve lost weight. I’m from Asia, where comments like that aren’t considered offensive. It was unexpected, but genuine and well-intended. Funny how those small, unplanned moments can be so validating.",1767719539.0,22,26,loseit,weight_loss

38yr old Female 5’5” & currently 144lbs (goal is 125lb)

I do two brisk pace (3.5mph) walks a day each around 1.5hrs long (ending with around 9-10 miles walked total)

Outside of that I do some gentle yoga & arm weight workouts a few times a week.

I work at a computer about 5 hrs 5 days a week, mix of standing desk and sitting.

1q5nu5c,Calorie Deficit Not Enough?,"I want to preface this post with I am NO stranger to weight loss (or gain). I have been an avid gym goer for 15 years. Have lost weight successfully in the past using 21 day fix, calorie counting, and counting macros. Have worked with 2 separate nutritionists. I believe in the calorie deficit. It works and it worked for me.

However after having my first baby 1 year ago, I CANNOT lose the last 15-20 lbs. I have been tracking my calories (using a food scale so it's accurate) for the past month religiously, but since about August 2025 (when I stopped pumping) I was still tracking although not as strictly as now. I get an average of 10k steps a day. I work out 4-5 times a week. I run. My average stand hours are 14 a day so I am not constantly sitting around. I can't remember the last time I had anything to drink besides water or seltzer water (not tonic!)

I recently got a lipid panel done as well as my thyroid - all tests came back normal. I am 5 foot 10, weigh 215 lbs, and my calorie goal (from previous nutritionist that WORKED before) is 1800, but I fluctuate anywhere between 1100 and 1500 a day. And yet....nothing. I mean...at this weight and height I DEFINITELY have to be in a deficit...right?

Does anyone have any suggestions? Any additional tests they think I can ask my doctor to run? I am so frustrated. I am being super honest with my food, my activity, my workouts and I am not getting anywhere.",1767718148.0,0,22,loseit,weight_loss
1q5nr7i,Very obvious take on why some people don’t count everything and others do,"I don’t know why it took me so long to figure this out- purely being self absorbed? I’ve never counted oil spray, a splash of milk, gummy vitamins or cough drops when trying to lose fat with CICO. My friend who also cuts periodically however is militant about counting. I just realized it’s because she’s 4’11” and I’m 5’11”. We’re both very active but by virtue of being a foot taller, my margin for error regarding my deficit is just much larger. So if you’re a short girl and your dumb gigantic friend tries to convince you cough drops don’t count, just roll your eyes and move on. My bad. 😅 ",1767717966.0,1485,164,loseit,weight_loss
1q5mxhh,Struggling to lose weight when food is my only source of joy,"I'm a late 20s male, around 20-25 kg  (50 lbs) overweight. I don't carry the  fat well at all. I can't grow facial hair well,so the extra face bloat makes me look like a teenager, which completely kills my dating life as well as lowers my confidence in general. Women literally think I'm barely 18, guys younger than me treat me like they're my elder, etc... I feel like people in general don't treat me like a serious, respectable adult due to the way I look. There are also  health issues the extra weight is causing. I really want/need to lose the weight for both my physical and mental health.

I'm very lonely which makes me sad and bordlerline depressed. I have some friends, but I'm nobody's priority friend, being able to see them only on rare occasions. I'm a super social person at heart, and there's nothing more I enjoy than being able to hang out with trusted friends, but I have to spend my evenings alone... I feel miserable most days and the way I tend to I cope is by eating good (often unhealthy) food and drinking alcohol... which just makes the weight issue worse.

I am not able to increase my exercise levels much at the moment, so the weightloss would have to come solely from reducing incoming calories. It just feels so hard to think that if I truly want to lose the weight, I'll have to be sad, lonely AND hungry for a long while before seeing results. The cold and dark winter certainly doesn't help either, it's hard to go outside and I feel an increased desire to eat in general. I wish I could to a fat camp or something.

1q5m80m,I'm not sure what I want anymore,"I've been dieting for about 4 years and I've realized that the beginning of the journey was relatively manageable, but the end is brutal.

As I lose weight my body adapts by decreasing my energy levels, reducing NEAT and lowering my metabolism, and the only reliable way I've found to push through plateaus is to lower calories more and more. This results in more hunger, less energy, being exhausted all day, not wanting to do anything, not even my hobbies, and feeling miserable.

I've already tried increasing my calories to a maintenance level and going back down again. Even taking a break and gaining weight. It does not work. I still need to reduce my intake to the same levels. I lose all my energy on day one, and it stays low for months without any change.

I've also been doing strength training for a few years and I'm slowly building muscle, but this seems to have a completely negligible effect as well.

I've even gone to the doctor and got tests, but everything is fine, he couldn't find any health issues making it harder to lose weight. 

It seems like my options are:

1. Push through the misery potentially for years
2. Maintain a more manageable but still unhealthy body weight with a strict diet
3. Eat healthy foods without strictly controlling the weight of what I eat, slowly gaining weight forever

I can manage a reasonable amount of hunger and slightly less energy, but just maintaining the weight in return feels so unfair and not worth it.

I'm not sure if the torture of losing weight is worth it. It affects pretty much everything else in my life. It's hard to concentrate at work. It's hard to make plans with my friends. It's hard to spend time with my partner.

I don't want to become obese again either. I'm between a rock and a hard place. None of the options seem worth it. And I'm tired.

Has anyone else had a similar dilemma? What are your thoughts?",1767714642.0,12,40,loseit,weight_loss
1q5lzpf,14 Years of Calorie Tracking,"I was a compulsive overeater my entire life

All the diets I tried failed.  I was a total glutton.

I met a guy in OA who was thin.  He told me he only ate 2000 calories a day, ever day, no matter what, and no cheat days.

I tried that with 2500 calories as my limit.  It changed my life.  I've done it every day for 14 years with no slips.  I weigh what I did in high school and am never hungry.

I found that my problem with food wasn't food quality but food quantity.  I eat whatever I want, but just limit my calories to less than 2500 per day.  When I did this, I discovered that my main problem was fear of not having enough pleasure from eating.

• Eating in a calorie deficit the right way

• Eating enough protein without starving myself

• Lifting weights regularly with some cardio

• Staying consistent instead of relying on motivation

• Learning how to recover from setbacks instead of quitting

I used to be very overweight, low on energy, and insecure. Now I train regularly, feel strong, and actually enjoy the process instead of hating it.

1q5ljaq,Asked ChatGPT and Google Gemini for a weight loss plan - can anyone confirm how accurate this meal routine is?,"For context, I'm 5'10, 30 y.o male and currently weigh 250lbs. I'd like to cut fat to 215 lbs (over the course of a few months) and maintain a lot of muscle mass to get that ""shredded"" look.

I box somedays, and lift and other days with a 1.5-2mi jog as a warmup before my workouts.

What both AI platforms suggested:

Breakfast

* 2 whole eggs
* 1/2 cup egg whites
* 1/2 cup (dry scoop) oatmeal
* 1 tbsp of Natural PB

Lunch

* 10 oz chicken breast
* 1 cup jasmine white rice
* 1 cup veggies

Dinner

* 8 oz ground beef 93/7
* 1 cup rice
* veggies

  
Snacks i've found I needed to hit Macros goals

* 2 Rice cakes + 2 Tbsp of natural peanut butter
* 1-2 scoops protein shake
* 1 cup low fat plain greek yogurt

Total Macros (approx): 2k Calories, \~180-200g of protein, 132g of carbs, \~70g of fat

I confirmed the macros are accurate using Cronometer, but this all feels like ALOT of food. I'm stuffing myself for breakfast and lunch when I'm used to eating half of those portions.

I am 34M 5ft 7 inch height, In July I was 96 kg. By end of October, I reduced to 90 kg. Since then, my weight has been stuck between 89.5–91 kg and just won’t go lower.
Body measurements also aren’t reducing anymore, mostly the same, sometimes even higher. Visually, I don’t see much change.
The only positive is that my strength has improved a bit, I can lift heavier.

Strength training 5–6 days/week
PPL split
Calories usually 1500–2000/day
Outside/fried food once every 10–15 days

Quick overview. 32M, 6’0” 318lbs.

Started at 412lbs January 2025, prescribed Zepbound and started personal training, and later ended personal training and kept going to the gym and I got down to \~320lbs in November 2025. Stopped taking Zepbound in December due to not feeling like I need to spend $500 a month anymore, I’ve formed the good habits.

That’s roughly where I’ve been since

1q5jmmz,Help a girl out,"Hi, So I’m 24F, around 224 lbs, and 5’3. Lately I’ve been feeling really big, and it’s honestly been hurting my self-esteem a lot. I don’t really feel good about how I look anymore, and it makes me sad. I just really want to see even small changes in the next month or two. I also have a boyfriend who looks sooo good and he is really fit too, and sometimes when we go on dates I end up feeling really insecure and ugly beside him. I know that’s not healthy, but it’s really how I feel and I want to fix it — for myself first.

The hardest part is always “Day 1.” I usually binge because I only eat like once a day or super late at night, and then the cycle just repeats. On top of that, I’m still studying, so my schedule is all over the place — maybe that’s part of why I struggle with routines too. I just really want to change. I want to feel pretty. I want to feel confident. And lately I’ve even been having trouble breathing sometimes, which honestly scares me — so I want to take this seriously now.

1q5hm0w,Short-term goals for long-term success,"I am unsure why it took 34 years of being alive to figure this out, but wow.

In November, I decided to lock in and try to lose 18 lbs before a trip to Hawaii. I skipped all sorts of holiday dinner invites, declined opportunities to go party, turned down free alcohol at music shows (I am a touring musician with a free, open tap that seems to follow us everywhere), and started being responsible for once. 

January 13 is the deadline to average 275, and I am currently at a weekly average (mind you, two days in to this week) of 274.8. I usually run by my end-of-week average, but it is insanely inspiring to see that number dip below my goal weight before the actual reporting date of Saturday. 

It has me super excited, and makes me want to set more incremental goals. I have always looked at weight loss as a long, tireless journey. Now I look at it as short jaunts. Start this, complete that, move onto this, obliterate that. 

As i approach Jan 13, I begin to set my sights on March 10, with a goal of losing another 15 lbs. Doing this will mean a loss of 33 lbs since Nov 2025.

As I crush goals, I can keep slowly adjusting and beating these challenges. The momentum seems unstoppable, and the best part is - this is no longer a motivation thing. It is driven by a burning desire to improve myself as a man, and that desire is one that has taken me years to find. 

If I had realized the effectiveness of short-term goals, I might not have given up so easy in prior years. What is ten pounds lost when you have 80 to lose? Obviously, not a whole lot. But if you're crushing 10-lb challenges left and right over time, it feels good. 

It has helped me to stop looking at the entire staircase, and just focus on the steps and maybe the occasional landings along the way. Look back and be amazed at your progress as you crush those goals.

brought them to work party last week and ate them instead of the regular candy everyone brought. nobody noticed or cared. felt normal instead of standing there with nothing while everyone ate.

1q5gc72,In a calorie deficit and not loosing weight,"Okay for reference I’m 5’6 19yr old female who weighs 65kg. I’ve always been very athletic (competitive swimmer particularly) and train at least 4 times a week.

I’ve always had body issues and feel chunky/bulky compared to other girls my age. Because of swimming (I tend to do about 8hrs a week of intense training) I’ve been able to eat what I like.

Recently I’ve been doing less swimming but more training in the gym. I’m also more focused on what I’m eating and tend to have about 1500-1800 calories on a usual day. My garmin watch says I’m burning at least 2200 every day so am I in a calorie deficit?? I also don’t wear my watch swim training however those I swim with do and they say they are burning 800+ calories a session? If anything I am gaining weight rather than loosing and I’m confused why. I know it’s not muscle as I have the scales that measure my muscle/fat etc and I haven’t gained any.

If anyone has any advice that would be great!! I eat a good amount of protein and pretty balanced diet. I’m currently what some people would call ‘skinny fat’ and want to be more lean.

Eat more fruit instead of savoury snacks

Eat more vegetables with dinner (I mainly eat rice/chicken/vegetables for dinner, but need more vegetables and maybe less rice)

Strength training 5 days a week

for the past 2 weeks my weight has been bouncing between 75-76kg (165-167lbs) and just not going down. it'll drop to 75.1kg (165.6lbs), spike to 76kg (167.5lbs), back to 75.4kg (166lbs), then 75.1kg again. just stuck in the same 1kg (2lb) range. i KNOW 2 weeks isn't that long but it's still frustrating as hell when you think you're doing everything right.

**storytime**: back in early november i started taking bupropion (for adhd) and it killed my appetite completely. i could go all day without feeling hungry. i still ate but way less - anywhere from 500-1200 cals but usually around 1000. never more than 1200. the weight was dropping consistently and i wasn't even trying that hard. the appetite suppression has since worn off now but i kept the same eating pattern and IF (3pm-8pm window). except now it's not effortless - i have to actually try and sometimes ignore hunger. weirdly, sometimes i don't feel physically hungry but i'll get nauseous and that's when i know my body needs food.

so, i am stuck now. over the holidays i ate more (maybe 1600-1800 on christmas eve and christmas day) but otherwise i'm doing everything the same that was working before except with no effects now. i keep seeing ""starvation mode isn't real"" which okay fine, but then why isn't cico working?

yes, i am become lazy since. i used to weight train 4x week and walk tons but it's given me nothing except for sore muscles. this is the first time i've actually successfully lost weight - down 1.5 sizes, pants that were tight are now loose. so this approach is working overall, i just want to understand WHY this stall is happening and if i can fix it. so, please, no lectures, i'm just trying to figure out the science.

**stats:** 170cm (5'7""), currently 75kg (165lbs), started 82 5kg (180lbs) early november. sedentary, work from home, \~6k steps daily.

**tldr:** lost weight consistently eating \~1000 cals nov-dec, now stuck at 75-76kg (165-167lbs) for 2 weeks. is this normal plateau or am i doing something wrong? or am i just crazy and overacting? should i just start running every morning",1767696085.0,1,3,loseit,weight_loss
1q5dv5o,New years goal is to follow a program made by legit coaches,"I’m a M28 and have been training for 2 years with my own bro splits and tiktok stuff but I haven’t really made gains this year. I think I need to follow a real program made by legit natural bodybuilding coaches instead of influencers. Coaching is pretty expensive at $150 to 200 a month for anything legit which is rough especially after holiday giftings that cleaned me out.

I’ve been looking at programs from Eric Helms, Alberto Nunez, and GVSon Boostcamp, all of those guys have free programs on Boostcamp. Obviously a template program is not personalized like me making my own program, but Alberto’s program has different variations for shoulder focus, torso focus, arm focus, leg etc, so it seems to be worth a shot to follow for 12 weeks for the new year.

For those who’ve followed template programs vs winging your own program, did you find that you made better progress past the beginner stage? I’m trying to figure out if I should just follow a free program first or actually save up for some coaching for my level.",1767690960.0,1,6,loseit,weight_loss

I grew up fat and my whole life I’ve heard “you are obese” and “you would look so pretty if you were skinny”. I’ve got called an investment to my face before and have heard it many times from men under their breath walking past me. 

I feel like this plays a huge factor in the reason why I want to lose weight but it angers me that I’m letting these comments get to me ig? Or letting these people win.",1767689964.0,16,45,loseit,weight_loss
1q5dj63,Looking old after weight loss,"I'm 55f, 5' 1"", currently 122 pounds. I've lost about 25 pounds since last July, so pretty slow. I've never been lighter than 120 before but I've been overweight or obese since I was a kid.

I feel way better now. My starting point was already lower than I'd been for ages, iyswim, so the weight loss feels more than it is. And I knew I'd lose weight off my face and show more wrinkles but still wasn't prepared.

I can see my face has aged since Sep, which is a 14 pound difference. Stupidly, I don't look loads slimmer in the face, just older!! I know it is what it is but is there any hope of looking a bit better, once I've stopped losing and things have evened out? Am I kidding myself that loose skin is more to blame than just being old enough to look old?

I feel annoyed at being upset over this. Being slimmer is life-changing and I've been able to wear clothes that never fitted before. But there is a small, mean part of me that says horrible things about my reflection, now that I feel I look so much older. 

Advice, please. Or just a friendly shake to get some sense into me would be fine. ",1767689679.0,17,18,loseit,weight_loss
1q5dcdk,It’s amazing what you can achieve in January if you get off to a good start,"I was 190lbs on New Year’s Day and could barely do 15 mins on the cross trainer I bought for Christmas. In the last six days I’ve completely transformed my diet and worked up gradually to managing an hour on the crosstrainer for the past two days.

Weighed myself this morning and I’m down to 186.2lbs. Some of that will be water and yes, it comes off quicker at the start. But I’m already at the stage where I feel I can hop on the trainer an hour after eating porridge and bananas, stick on Netflix and get it done with no drama.

The best thing anyone dreading the change can do is tackle it head-on in January and get it out of the way for the rest of the year 💪🏻",1767688961.0,205,16,loseit,weight_loss

I’ve eaten at a calorie deficit, used to be \~1200 for years & recently increased it to 1500. I normally don’t have a full blown meal late at night, usually a snack or dessert. I still maintain my calorie deficit for the duration of the day, this has been a habit for years and no repercussions atm. My mom always warned me of doing this, as I won’t be able to keep this up forever.

I'm in my first year of uni and after falling victim to the freshmen 15 I decided to start going to the gym this semester and some of my friends invited me to join them. I went today and it was honestly so fun and for the first time in my life I want to go back tomorrow but they're trying to gain muscle while I'm trying lose weight. I did the same exercises as them (mostly weightlifting) but I don't know if I should continue working out with them if I won't be able to lose weight. ,1767680928.0,81,35,loseit,weight_loss
1q5aj46,"How did I gain in a deficit w/ exercise, and how to keep the hope?","Hi, been doing this for about a week. I know I am impatient, to preface. I read that 1-2 lbs is healthy per week to lose, so I am aiming for that. However, I somehow went up in weight by like 5 pounds, even though this week, I went to the gym 4 times for like 2 hours each and am eating nearly 1000kcal less than my maintenance weight, all quite clean and healthy foods.

Am I doing something wrong? I know the journey is rough, yet I am seriously confused. I think I am doing things ""right"" but the outcome is really puzzling me. I don't expect to lose it all at once, but, like... what is happening? 

I will continue to do what I'm doing, but I want to make sure I'm not actively harming myself in some way. Does anyone have any idea why I might have increased in avg weight while in a deficit and exercising? Many thanks, and I can clarify anything if more info would help. 

Additionally, now that I know how much of a problem my weight is, I'm finding it hard to just... exist. I am hyperaware every inch of my body and how large it is. I don't like to look at myself in mirrors (which is dramatic, I'm not Dracula.) I'm facing the same deep shame that has made me stop trying to lose it in the past. Any tips on how to get past this kind of thing? I want to make a serious effort, and I think my self-image is a key way to maintain this journey.

1q5agb5,Yogurt recommendations???,"Hi guys,

I just lose 10kg and wanted to add some variety to my meals like snacks and such as I'm reaching my goal and have consistent exercise. I never was a fan of non-fat greek yogurt because it's so sour and bitter to me. I recently tried Olympic's Krema Coconut yogurt (Canada) and I absolutely LOVED IT. However, I checked the nutritional facts afterwards and there's wayyyy too much sugar and calories in there. The texture is very creamy/silky/velvetly and extremely  rich because of whole milk used. I know that high fat is probably the most important factor that makes the yogurt so good but are there any low-fat alternatives that anyone has tried and doesn't have that sour taste for traditional greek yogurt. Also please let me know delusion for thinking this could exist - I have no clue how yogurt is made.",1767678647.0,2,21,loseit,weight_loss
1q5a2sz,Losing weight to fit in a wheelchair,"I currently reside in Japan, and I am too heavy (well, technically *wide*) to fit in their standard chair. I do have their version of a self-propelled larger chair, but that chair is too wide to have the standard motor bike attachment, and bariatric ones don't exist - unless I go custom, which take longer to make then I will live here.

I cannot do cardio due to being disabled (heart rate issue), although I can walk maybe 4-6km every other day, a limit I cannot go over without being in serious danger of reinjuring my foot.

I have started weightlifting, gentle swimming and measuring my food with a scale etc, so I'm guessing my question is more psychological - how do you keep up with that  when the reason you are fat in the first place is because you ate to cover up a pain doctors refused to admit exist (until a year ago, when I finally got diagnosis and some medicines that helped)? 

I'd say about 10 pounds of my weight gain is medication related so I'm never going to be slim, but I'd like to be able to fit in standard sized equipment because they are cheaper and more readily available, and I need to lose weight to avoid further complications

I have terrible fatigue so I try to batch cook ahead where possible, and I can't access guided (mental) therapy at the moment as my Japanese isn't good enough (and let's face it, the waiting list in my own country is bonkers).  However, I am trying ACT therapy as I have had CBT therapy many times and found it ineffective for me (I don't need to intellectulise my issues, I know that's helpful for some)

I'm currently 110kg, and if I could get even 20kg to stay off it would make my life so much better.

Are meal replacement shakes/bars and a multivitamin a safe, non-permament option just to get the ball rolling? I know how to make a healthy meal, I just either don't have the energy or fall into the trap of hoping that sugar will make life bearable in a body that is always in pain.

I was already very overweight before the end of the year and put on 10 pounds in the last couple months around the holidays. I’m trying to just get back to normal… I was eating so much. Going out to eat. Cookies galore… anyway I don’t calorie count but since the new year I’ve been cooking all my meals at home and really just portion controlling my plate and no snacking. Again I don’t count calories or anything so I’m not sure what the deficit is but I know I’m deff not starving like I eat 3 regular size meals with protein, fat and a carb. But anyway the question I have is I have been feeling “hungry” before bed. Like basically after dinner all I can think about is my next meal and food and I feel like I’m starving but I literally can’t tell if it’s real hunger or not? I feel like it can’t be because I ate a good dinner. But I’m like is this just a normal part of weight loss feeling hungry all the time? I never hear people talk about this part so I’m struggling to know if maybe I should eat if I feel this way? Or just power through and eventually it will go away??

Stats
35M 240lbs ( 248 starting weight )
Activity 

Light activity at work 5 days on 4 days off mostly walking doing chores around 2-3 hours a day but sometimes doing a rec sport for an hour or so ( i work with kids so it depends on the day)

Days off are pretty sedentary light house work and up to an hour walk on a treadmill (say 2/4 days off) and light exercises rehabing my back and shoulder

I've now been calirie tracking for 27 days I've been trying to hit ~1910 cals which is the target MFP recomended but when I started with a trainer at the gym (help  getting started at the gym my works helps cover some of the starting costs) they used so measuring tool and the thing he sent recommends 2469-2569 a day and I'm not sure where i should be aiming i just started going to the gym hoping to average 2 times on days off and once while working 

Since I started tracking i have not had much trouble with hunger at 1910 I'm actually averaging  ~1800 after switching to healthier foods this gas been easier then I thought ( helps kicking 750 of drink calories out and switching fried chicken to grilled and no fries lol )

I want this to be consistent as my goal is losing weight but I want to do it in a healthy manner.

I have struggled with binge eating in the past and that’s what I’ve been working on. I tend to overeat until I physically can’t eat anymore, and that’s what lead to my weight gain. Now I’m focusing on just eating until I’m full and not constantly snacking.
My cravings have went down tremendously, and i feel so good about myself even though it’s not a significant change yet.
But for some reason whenever I’m full, not even nasty-can’t-walk full, I feel like I’m failing. It feels like Im losing my progress even though I’m not.

1q536ow,Gained back all my hard work from last years new year resolution. Want to start fresh but feeling super down and lost. ISO of advice,"I’m 23, 5’6”. I started losing weight on February 10, 2025 at 210 lbs and by around September I had lost about 50 lbs. I felt like I was finally getting my life and body back.
Then I had surgery, had to be off work and activity, got stressed, and coped by stress eating. I quit my routine, and over the following months I gained those 50 lbs back and more. Now it’s January 2026 and I’m 225 lbs at 5’6”, the heaviest and most out of shape I’ve ever been. 😔 
So I guess I’ll just let my guard down and ask: For people who’ve lost a lot, regained, and tried again: Was it worth it? How did you deal with the fear of loose skin and the shame of regaining while still pushing yourself to do the work again?",1767659006.0,9,14,loseit,weight_loss
1q5360o,No motivation like potentially dying!,"I would love to start this out by saying that I am 15. I'm young, and I fear for my life because of my weight. Obesity epidemic goes hard fr ig??

Ever since childhood, nobody around me watched over my diet and gave in whenever I would ask for sweet/unhealthy foods with zero moderation, because it would hurt the feelings of the obese child wouldn't it? Like a lot of not great parents, they would scold me for being full after eating half my plate, making me internally normalize overeating, unfortunately. Even when I got older, nobody told me no or tried to watch my diet, and it definitely doesn't help that I have ADHD and am very impulsive when it comes to food. Seriously, my life has been ruined because of having parents that don't care about their kids diet.

I know by now that I'm old enough to control what I eat, but I'm also not old enough to be able to buy my own food that's actually good for me. I ask for fruit a lot, and whenever someone in my house buys fruit it's never for me, it's for the younger kids and I'm not allowed to have any. I have a lot of people in my house, and children, unfortunately. The adults but their own stuff, but keep it all in one fridge, so I have no idea what I'm allowed to eat half the time.

Now why am I potentially dying? Well, I've recently been having stabbing, aching/throbbing pains under my right rib for the past few days, where the liver is located. So, the most likely cause is fatty liver because nobody fucking watched my diet as a kid, and I wasn't able to get my impulsivity under control fast enough with meds. Now that I've been scared into actually, finally making a change, I've immediately noticed how my mother specifically is far too lax when it comes to food. She is also overweight, and has had issues with her gallbladder because of drinking and a poor diet. I don't drink, obviously, but I do eat like shit. My grandmother is also too lax when it comes to me eating food, probably because she doesn't want to hurt my feelings. Because telling the obses child that they can't have food is obviously the worst possible thing that can happen, not dying of liver disease, no. Of course not.

Sorry for the rant, tl;dr, I might have a liver illness/disease, I may be dying slowly, and I've been scared into fixing myself without any outside help because my family is really touchy and iffy about talking about weight and diet.

My whole life was revolved around fast food and comfort food. I have never been obese but there was like 2 times in my life where I was a few pounds heavier than I wanted to be. When I was between 18-22 I somehow created what I believed was an eating disorder. Would see certain foods as bad and others okay to eat. I was extremely lean (weighed about 175, height 5’11) but internally not happy. At the age of 28 I gained some weight and got to about 210-215. I would describe the way I looked at my heaviest as oh he lifts but he’s got some fat on him too. Anyways I got down as of June to about 195 (was pretty consistent diet wise). Anyways the holidays came and since then I’m on a downhill spiral again. I haven’t gained weight yet but if I don’t quit I know I will. I’m at work today and had lunch about 6 hours ago ate chicken fingers and fries for lunch plus a huge cookie at the hospital cafe. Now I just had dinner and ate the lean beef and rice I brought but had 2 more large cookies and 3 bags of individual sized chips. I’m making this post because I always seem to fall off the ladder eventually and I think it all stems back to me being a young adult with that eating disorder. I don’t have a healthy relationship with food and see food as pleasure.

1q4yinj,Smart Scale vs DEXA Results w Data (Update),"A few months ago I made a post here comparing the data my smart scale had been providing to my first DEXA Scan.  I had been cutting down for some months but noticed all of the secondary/ancillary measurements my smart scale (RENPHO ES-CS20M) was providing moved in lockstep with my weight, meaning any time I landed on weight X all of the other information, including things that should obviously fluctuate more like body water, would revert to where they had been the last time I hit that weight.  This also included my bone density apparently falling off a cliff (started at 9.0 in June and dipped to as low as 8.4 by November) and other weird details that made me suspicious of the reliability of that data.

Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1nowg8g/smart_scale_vs_dexa_results_data/), though I had trouble properly formatting the table, had to post an image of my spreadsheet, so it wasn't as cleanly presented as I'd have liked.  Most measurements were reasonably close (within about 2-5%), but of course that was only 1 data point.

I had my 2nd scan a couple weeks ago and thought I'd compile the original data with the new information for comparison.  Normal caveats apply.  Neither is 100% perfect or reliable.  Renpho and BodySpec do not measure all of the same things and do not use the same terminology for the things they do measure, so I've tried to match things in the way that makes most sense to me.  I used bold for those measurements that seem common between the two.  I'm just keeping this organized in the most basic text-based way to avoid any of the problems last time.

For all of these, the 9/20 scan info is first and 12/20 scan info second, delineated by a >

RENPHO Metabolic Age: 53 > 51

Takeaways: I could pull info from my scale from as far back as June or July to further illustrate this, but Obviously my initial hunch, that the smart scale was simply applying a formula based on weight and height rather than actually measuring most of these secondary things day to day seems well supported.  I was pleasantly surprised at how many measurements were within a few percentage points in September.  Even if the measurements are off, I'd expect the trajectory of most if not all of them to look similar between the two if the scale was actually doing what the advertisements suggest.

Also... final caveat just because it still bites my ass a little bit.  I spent the last few days leading up to the 12/20 scan cutting to get my weekly average down to about 225 (my goal/target) and this culminated in going in a little flat/depleted.  The night before I did extra cardio and hit the sauna.  That morning my arm and leg measurements took a startling hit, telling me that lean mass measurement was lower than it probably should have been.  I'm assuming I was at least half a pound lower than I should have been (overall, in terms of lean mass and in terms of fat mass) had I just given myself a night off and not intentionally dehydrated myself.   Live and learn.  Next scan should be in late June and I wont make that mistake again.",1767648125.0,1,0,loseit,weight_loss

A diet is already in the works, but I'm having trouble finding out what sort of exercise would be best for me. I'm 5'5 and 147 pounds. This isnt extremely overweight for me, and my doctor says I don't really need to lose any at all, but I was 128 pounds at the beginning of 2025 and would like to be that weight again. My main thing is getting rid of my face fat, but I thought if I was going to exercise to get rid of that I might as well exercise to get healthier overall, right?

Lots of people have recommended I do pilates, which sounds good in theory, but I only ever see really skinny girls do that and I' not sure if thats a 'lose weight' or 'get toned sort of thing. 

In beginning of 2025 and before that I was fasting pretty often and was also a vegetarian (which I quit doing mid May during a family BBQ 😓). I'm thinking of going vegetarian again, but protein seems important if I'm going to get healthier and I honestly was pretty weak when I was on that diet.

1q4w8on,My wife and I are having a diet discussion.,"We are both women and we are not dieting or choosing to diet. We have a science discrepancy.

If I ate 1000 calories of flax seeds or 1000 calories of bacon, which will gain me more weight?

I argue that if we do not measure flax for the water loss you'll have due to the fiber and bowel movements, you will gain the same assuming it is the same body. I argue that the body will process it differently, but the calories in are still calories in. I.e., if each seed was 1 calorie and you lost about .5 calories per seed because of it ""passing right through you) then the net caloric intake for 1000 cals is 2000 seeds. I don't know the calories in the seed, just using an example. Thus, 2000 seeds is 1000 cals and will equal the same as 1000 cals of bacon from a weight gain perspective.


Her argument is that different foods would make you lose weight regardless of the same calories. I.e. 1000 cals of broccoli will lose you weight while 1000 of bacon would not.

What scientific articles are there? I feel like we are both slightly wrong. I don't really want to know who is right, just what the science says. 

We went through tons of diet fads as kids to now. Fats are evil, no carbs are! No. Eggs are evil. All dairy is evil! But then there's intermittent fasting which DOES lose you weight... And some aspects of the other diets (keto, etc) require calorie restrictions and exercise. I know most of the fads are just fads. But restriction and exercise will certainly work in the long run, so long as you are below your TDEE.

I also know TDEE is not easily measured for a person and can be wildly off by calculators. Most say mine is about 1450 cals a day. There are many genetic factors that can change what my TDEE actually is (like diabetes).

I lost weight the first time because I was living with my mom, and I was trying to help her eat healthier as I was. It didn’t really work completely on her end but I tried hard to model how to be better and it ended up keeping me accountable. 

I live by myself now and I can’t have that same accountability for myself. I just keep telling myself, well, I’m hungry, so I’ll just continue to eat. I’m hungry, and the food will go bad, so I’ll just eat it. I’m hungry, and I want sweets, I want to eat a whole cake, a whole bag of chocolates, and there’s no one to stop me. It also happened at college where the desserts were always open, there was always a buffet of food, late night orders, ice cream pick ups, no one is around and I can indulge in my “cravings.” 

I just don’t know how to eat normally or be accountable for myself. I can’t even eat normally when I am in the company of others because I am afraid of eating the wrong things and eating too much or too little, so when I am by myself and I decide to eat a whole piece of focaccia bread from the bakery, I do it because it tastes good and I’m hungry, but if I was with company I would cut a slice for myself to have with dinner and that’s it.

I’d really appreciate advice on how to approach fat loss in a **healthy, sustainable, long-term way**. I’ve included detail so you have the full picture.

**Stats & background:**

* Age: 29
* Sex: Female
* Height: 167 cm
* Weight: \~70 kg
* Body type: Hourglass
* Goal: Lose body fat / lean out while maintaining as much muscle as possible
* I build muscle relatively easily but often feel like I “bulk” instead of leaning out

I’ve attached a photo of where I’m at now. [https://imgur.com/a/current-photos-PfVP0FE](https://imgur.com/a/current-photos-PfVP0FE)

**Important context:**  
I’ve added comparison photos from 2021 (\~59 kg), when I felt more comfortable with my body. [https://imgur.com/a/old-photos-UNmWjFO](https://imgur.com/a/old-photos-UNmWjFO)

That was the result of **severe depression and undereating** (often not eating all day, then having a bag of chips). I was unhealthy, had little muscle mass, and didn’t feel good overall.

I **do not want to recreate that situation or exact look**. I understand I was thinner due to lack of food, not fitness. That said, I’d like to move toward a similar *level of leanness*—this time with muscle, health, and sustainability.

I estimate I may have \~10 kg of body fat to lose.

**Training & activity (since 2023):**

Does anyone have any experience with this product for weight loss? I am finding mixed reviews with regards to sourdough but from what I can tell, this is one of the better ones you can find at Costco. From what I can tell, sourdough bread seems to spike your blood sugars a lot slower than most breads and also keeps you fuller a lot longer than you would think. On the other hand, you have people swearing off all bread given that it is considered processed. What do you guys all think?",1767639133.0,0,15,loseit,weight_loss

I spent two weeks with my family, enjoying delicious meals, going out, and eating in a calorie surplus every day. At the time, I told myself it was the holidays and that I’d just get back on track afterward.

Well, now that I'm back, I'm struggling more than I expected. I know it's irrational, but I feel crippled by guilt. I worked so hard on myself and finally started to feel confident in my body and beautiful for the *first time* in my life.

And now, I ruined everything, and it's all 100% my fault. When I see my reflection, I hate what I see. My face is so puffy, and I feel so utterly disgusting and uncomfortable existing in my body that I want to crawl out of my own skin. I feel so guilty for doing this to myself.

I really wanted to enjoy food over the holidays but continue my progress so I let myself on specially thanksgiving and Christmas and my birthday which is in December. No tracking, just put an estimated calorie count on my app. The trick for me was to just get right back to it the next day, again and again.

1q4s3g8,"I ate half of an entire pie by my self over the Christmas holiday break, and I'm sad that I can never do it again. :(","I ate half of a pie by my self over the 2-week Christmas break, but that's not the part that makes me sad. The part that makes me sad is that this was my all-time favorite pie, and I'll never be able to have it again

The reason is that this particular pie was made for me by my 98-year-old grandma and she specifically told me that it is the last one she will ever make, because at her age, it is too much of a hassle to bake. The main ingredient, wild mustang grapes, are endemic to the area I grew up, and there is only about a 10-day window in which you can pick them when they are pea-sized before the skin gets hard, they fill with seeds and become super sour. My dad has been picking the grapes for her for the past few years, but with the crazy droughts they have been having back home, most of the wild vines on our property have died. They used to be all over the place when I was growing up, and my grandma would bake pies throughout the year using the literal buckets of grapes we picked during the picking window every year. Now there are only 2 or 3 vines left. It took 2 years worth of harvesting to get enough for the pie she baked for me this year, and she doesn't think she'll be around long enough to make another one. 

As for eating half of the pie: I ate one piece fresh, and then froze 4 slices individually and shared them for breakfast with my wife as the holidays went on. I had my last piece yesterday morning, and added a note in my MyFitnessPal diary that it was the end of an era :(

Even with eating half of a pie, I was still able to hit my calorie goals and continue losing weight over the holidays. Don't let these special treats slip by just because you're on a fitness journey. You never know when it will be your last chance to have that home-baked treat!

1q4rgqk,Isn't it wild how society treats you WAY differently after weight loss,"22F. I'm someone who's lost around 35 kg (77lbs) and honestly, I can't even recognize my social life anymore. In high school I was this tall, fat girl who nobody really wanted around. No matter how sweet and polite or funny I was, the first thing I'd here from my male ""friends"", ""Oh look the elephant is coming by"". I was called a planet, Hulk, King Kong, Romelu Lukaku (I dont look anything like him). Girls didn't want to stand beside me in photos, I'd get cropped out of insta stories, Horrible shit. Basically had no real friends. But I always got attention from creepy older men lol.

Fast forward now, suddenly guys think I'm so funny, cool, quirky. A guy even told me to try out for modeling considering my height. Girls wanna be friends with me, they don't avoid me like the plague anymore. I get more favoured by proffs while I was basically a laughing stock for my teachers in school. It's not as hard to make friends anymore.

Now y'all might say that my confidence shot up or something and that's why the upgraded social life. It DEFINITELY DIDN'T. Rather losing the weight made me even more insecure about my body. I dress conservatively to cover up stretch marks. I always thought that there was something wrong with me and that's why people didn't want to befriend me. Turns out I was just too fat.

My school friends don't treat me better tho. Every time I've conversed with them, especially after the weight loss, they now feel more comfortable dissing and making fun of my old body: thinking I hate past self too. I don't. I'm still the same person within. I just don't talk to them anymore. It's like their hatred for my fat body is now pouring out more freely :(

There was nothing wrong with me at all. I was just fat. And that was enough for people to treat me like I didn't deserve basic decency. Did any of y'all face this?

1q4pd09,High Protein Dessert Peanut Butter Balls (with optional non-dessert version) recipe,"I made up this recipe last night and while it is definitely more dessert it still has a decent amount of protein (and it's an easy swap for a non-dessert version)

100g (1 cup) Oats  
250g (1 cup) peanut butter (I used ones with 100% peanuts, no other ingredients)  
4 scoops vanilla protein powder (\~80g) (I used premiere brand). Chocolate would be good too I imagine.  
1 can (14oz/396g) sweetended condensed milk (evaporated milk for non-dessert option)

Put everything in a bowl and mix until combined. Make into balls about 35g each (heaping tablespoon.) I ended up making 16 from it, nutrition is based off that.

for the dessert version 1 has 204 calories, 10g fat, 19g carbs, 2g fiber, 11g protein, and 14g sugar (yes, it's a good amount, but it \*is\* a dessert)

non dessert version the macros are the same except each one has 153 calories 10g carbs and 4g sugar)

I haven't tested the non-dessert version (didn't have evaporated milk on hand), you will likely need to add more oats or something like coconut flakes to make it less sticky. Or even another scoop or two of protein powder. I don't have macro measurements for that. When I do try this version I will update you all on what I needed to add and the macros if you'd like.

Is it the healthiest? No, but desserts aren't made to be healthy. But these satisfied my sweet tooth while satiating my hunger (and only needed 1 before I was done)",1767628483.0,3,10,loseit,weight_loss

Currently trying to get into meal prepping instead of just choosing what I eat in the moment as I've come to realize that my diet is mainly what is holding me back from actually losing weight. I'm not a ""snacker,"" so I never have anything like candy, chips, cookies, etc. laying around, but I am very *lazy* when it comes to cooking meals. So since I do not meal prep, do not have snacks, and don't feel like spending 30+ minutes cooking whenever I am hungry I end up *eating sleep* for dinner or ordering something (usually greasy/unhealthy) on UberEats.

But it still does get me sometimes. It’s almost like a compulsion/binge. I’m not saying I want to go completely free of this type of food or no more deliveries ever, but I do find it very hard not to sometimes.

How can I maximize my weight lost for this year, goal for next year is 250, but I am not sure how realistic this is. I am finally at college and have a lot more independence. Things I need help with is what to eat, how many calories, what not to eat, and what activities can I do to not only loose weight but build muscle. One thing to note, I am not open to going to a gym. I am open to buying weights, and anything necessary, it's easier to put it like there is no gym near me. 





**Food:** 



I have access to a dining account provided by my school, there are many different things I could eat, pasta, sandwiches, pizza, hamburgers, you know the usual, but there is also more options within your typical plate, vegetables, and some sort of meat. also what should i eat for breakfast? we have eggs, sausage, bacon, quesadilla, French toast? I can also cook simple things if I want to do it my way. my usual plate for breakfast at home were 3 chorizo and potato, bean burritos. but we are not doing that again. can i drink coffee? I like coffee? but I don't want to do sugar? what happens if I just completely take sugar out of my diet? as far as my blood test go, I am approaching a stage of pre-diabetes, and I have noticed some skin tags and darker areas in my neck. so basically for this section, what should i eat? what should I completely not touch, for example, tortillas are out, I used to eat 8-10 per meal.



**Exercise:** 



I did play sports in high school, but I just don't find myself doing that again in college as a physics + math major. I don't have any movement restrictions, but i do get tired very easily as expected. what can I do at home to loose weight, exercises? should I buy weights? what kind of things should i do. I will take more walks, but being my size, I care to much about what people think of me, so going on runs is a bit embarrassing, I just don't want to be seen, but that is a problem that only I can solve, it's going to take some time on my end.

1q4n567,Does a 10/12 week mini-cut make sense for losing ~5 kg after prior weight loss?,"Happy new year everyone!

I’m 31F, 165 cm, currently 65 kg. I lost about 7 kg over 2025 and would like to lose another ~5 kg. From experience, I think 60 kg looks and feels good on me, and my plan after that would be to focus on building/maintaining muscle, not continuing to diet.

Previously, I lost weight without calorie counting by mostly focusing on eating a high volume fruit & veg
protein at every meal and reduced dinner carbs unless I trained (i’m vegetarian). 

I’m now considering a planned 10–12 week mini-cut of around  400 cals per day (as in, going from 2000 to 1600) with a clear start and end date followed by a maintenance phase
possibly paired with a 12-week workout program to take advantage of novelty and structure (suggestions welcomed!)

My slower approach worked well with my obsessive mind as I was not counting calories but it went pretty slow. I've taken this idea from a mini cut after reading a bit more about fat loss.

My questions before I go full in:
- Has anyone found a short, structured cut easier to stick to than a ''slower''  but open-ended approach?
-For people who already lost weight, did added structure help with the last few kilos?
-Does this seem sensible given I’m not starting overweight and plan to shift focus to muscle afterward?

or what is the thing you look forward to be able to do most? from those at the start of their journey.

As of now I lost 120lbs from 280 to 160 (I am 5”11), and it is so crazy to me that I can’t see it when I look at myself.  I feel the same now as I did before but seeing how I looked two years ago make me feel so much shame and disgust (I would NEVER feel like that towards someone else that is pulse size). I was chubby since i was 8 and now that I’m considered “heathy BMI” I feel like i sometimes need proof that that’s actually true…

-Noticing the facts is a cool feeling though… here are some of mine:
buying clothes in the standard straight size section, or even in shops that are extremely non inclusive, it’s ungraspable. 

-Being able to borrow clothes from friends, trying them on with the fear they won’t fit but then they somehow do.

-dreading the plastic chair with handles, the seat belts, making sure no one is looking while you try to squeeze in but then you fit with much space left.

-sitting with double crossed legs.


Things I’m still looking forward to and I think would be extremely transformative:

-Going to the doctors and not being over looked, being actually listened to. Because they can’t blame my weight anymore. 

-going on a seesaw swing and for the first time since being a kid, not being the heavier one.

-being lifted up

1q4l54u,Lost 100 lbs & Found What I was Seeking the Whole Time,"I lost 100 lbs over 1.5 years and kept it off for 2 years - no ozempic - without gaining muscle. I don’t regret my choice, I needed to do this process one piece after the other and meaningful weight loss…

*\[\[What is my frame writing this? I just became self conscious of it… it feels explanatory, intellectual almost apologetic. How often do I embody this frame? Wow. This is so interesting to feel and observe almost as a third party within myself… I’ll try a new frame on for size. But I don’t want to try, I want it to come from my being. \]\]*

*\[\[ I looked in the mirror and pulled my loose skin back. I imagined myself more muscular. I found so much relief in just imagining this. I felt that I could be unashamed as a present and sexual being. I felt that I could show up with my partner in new and exciting ways. That I could be playful and erotic and unburdened. \]\]*

*\[\[ I’m not happy with how I look and feel. I’m not happy with how I held myself back the last 3 years. I’m not happy that I put myself in a position to need to lose 100 lbs. \]\]*

*\[\[ I’m seeing more clearly how I was the only one in the way of myself. How much of my self-experience (and experience with others) has been mediated by my body. \]\]*

*\[\[ I can feel how my experiences in life, even moment to moment, would have been truly radically different since I was 8 or 14 years old if my relationship with my body had been different. If my self-experience were different. \]\]*

*\[\[ I’m not willing to just be with those feelings. Especially the grief. I have been avoiding this grief and the avoidance has made me less capable, alive, intelligent even. I’m not sure how but I know this is true. \]\]*

*\[\[ we are constantly revealing our frame and how we feel. Even if we are unaware of it. \]\]*

If I drop the intellectualization, if I drop the idea of “process”, if I drop the frame that my body is a project I am managing that if I just work hard enough one day will feel good so I’m able to ignore how I feel now…

If I drop those and just be present with how my body feels and how it feels to be in my body I am sad. Feeling present in my body feels sad/sorrow.

So there is grief for the past and there is sorrow in the present.

I don’t want to feel this. I’ve not wanted to feel this. I’ve avoided feeling this in so many ways. It goes beyond my weight and the skin and the lack of muscle. It goes to how my age is showing up, how the ways I’ve not taken care of myself are catching up, how inadequate I feel my genitals are.

It feels disgusting to be inside of myself. Even after everything I’ve done to try to make it better. I’ve not been chasing a weight on a scale or a PR or a look. I’ve been chasing not feeling disgusted by / in my body. 

A freedom to exist. A freedom to not be self conscious. A freedom to be seen. A freedom to desire and be desired. A freedom to just exist, to just be.

I don’t think I have a problem with touch and sexuality and sex etc. I think I have a self-experience of disgust and fear of my body that I have been running from and grief and sorrow.

1q4l4w9,Anyone else thinking about food all of the time?,"Lately I've realized that the biggest struggle with weight loss isn't that I don't know what to eat (I feel like I have gotten past that point), but that I'm just tired of thinking about food constantly.

I'll do well for a while, then I'll have one ""off"" meal or day, and instead of just moving on my brain goes straight to ""welp, today's ruined"". Then I end up eating way worse than what I would have had I just relaxed.

It's frustrating because the nutrition part feels simple on paper, but mentally feels heavy. Planning, tracking, deciding, second-guessing... every day.

I'm wondering whether this resonates with anybody else.",1767618208.0,39,26,loseit,weight_loss
1q4l26d,Struggling with weight loss (Posting this for my girlfriend),"I have been overweight since I was a kid, and I grew up in a really stressful environment with a lot of trauma. I’ve always had a bad relationship with food, and my own parents bullied me for it. I was very fragile as a child, and that made me gain even more weight.

Right now, I am comfortable in my body. I can work out for hours, and I am pretty healthy. I don’t hate healthy food at all, but I still like snacks such as chocolate, crisps, and gummies. I don’t eat out or eat very unhealthy food. I like carbs a lot, which is sadly my main issue, and I don’t really eat meat.

I have anemia, which makes it really hard for me to eat foods with enough iron and protein. Because of that, when I really need to, I consume protein in small portions, and I can maintain that when I’m not dieting.

My biggest struggle starts here. I love vegetables, salads, chicken breast, non-fatty meat, and healthy carbs like quinoa, lentils, beans, and chickpeas. In my normal life, for example, the other day I had cauliflower with no oil and no carbs, just marinated with egg and yogurt, and I enjoyed it so much. For breakfast, I had an omelette with cheese, some strawberry yogurt, and unsweetened cornflakes for texture. I know I could give up the cornflakes because they’re unnecessary.

When I try to eat like this while “dieting,” my appetite disappears and I feel like not eating at all. Then I get very hungry and start craving food, but I know that if I start eating, I won’t be able to stop and I’ll binge. Because of that, I sometimes end up not eating for the whole day, which is not what I want.

My height is 1.60 m, and the last time I checked, my weight was around 88–90 kg. I know I am overweight and I want to do something about it, but I just can’t.

i can diet but i cant make myself, the idea of dieting makes me wanna starve myself i would rather die than diet honestly",1767618018.0,0,21,loseit,weight_loss
1q4k9mw,"26M with ADHD, ASD and chronic depression — looking for advice on fat loss and muscle gain","Hi everyone,



Back in November I hit rock bottom. I started coping by eating a lot, and my habits got pretty bad. Four years ago I was extremely skinny, but now I weigh 84 kg. I’m not obese, but I’m definitely not lean either.

I really want to change my routine and try going to the gym. If I manage to stick to it, it would be the first time in my life that I actually do consistent exercise. The problem is that I don't really know where to start.



I've been told that what I should aim for is body recomposition (losing fat while gaining muscle), but I'm very confused about everything:

I don't know what supplements I actually need (if any)

I don't know what kind of food I should be eating

I already bought workout clothes and shoes, so that part is covered

I’m autistic (ASD), so structure really helps me. Is there any app that explains what each gym machine is for? I'm worried about showing up on day one and not knowing what to do or where to go.

For example:

Should I start my first day just walking on the treadmill?

Do I need protein shakes or other supplements?

Should I buy creatine, or is that unnecessary?

How should I structure my meals?

I’d really appreciate any advice, especially beginner-friendly and structured guidance.

Thanks in advance and happy new year.",1767615637.0,1,5,loseit,weight_loss

1q4gbx2,Weight Loss Gut Issues,"I am a trans MtF person of age 18 and I am not currently on any medication for hormones or the such. I have been working on losing weight and getting slim for at least 8-10 months now. I have officially gotten from 240-180 (177.7 last checked) and I am happy of the progress I have made but that is not where my issue lies.

When I think of slim I think of having no gut, but that is where my issue lies. I have dieting for the entire 8-10 months using apps like MyNetDiary to track what foods I eat, cutting down on how much I eat, and what specific foods I eat. I admit I only have started working out recently and have only been doing intentional workouts for a week, but my work as a online order fulfiller does take a lot of walking and heavy lifting, and i am full time. So I tend to get my fill in on working out. 

Even with all of that, my stomach still seems to be a big gut. When I lay down, it vanishes, or if I do a stomach vacuum, same results. Although when I stand up, it seems to reappear and show a small, but noticeable gut. Also accompanied while sitting down like on a chair and or just sitting straight up in general where it appears bigger than standing or laying. 

The thing I ask is that I would like to know if I am doing something wrong or if there is more I can do to help the situation I am in. Any and all help is welcome, and I am willing to hear real answers and I am not soft so don’t hold back on the truth. If more detail is needed I’m happy to provide it in the comments.

1q4fy0z,"26F, 5’4”, 85kg. Where do I start?","Hi everyone,

  
I’m posting here because I genuinely need guidance and accountability, and I don’t want to keep starting over on my own.

I’m a 27F, 5’4” (163 cm), currently around 85 kg. I’ve been struggling with weight for a while, and it’s been especially hard because I have PCOS and insulin resistance, which makes hunger, cravings, and fatigue a constant thing. I’m on metformin 1000 mg per day and recently started taking my health more seriously.

My lifestyle is mostly sedentary due to work, but I’ve recently started going to the gym (very beginner level). Right now I can manage treadmill walking and light upper-body workouts, but lower body strength is… rough 😅. I also struggle with consistency and emotional eating, especially sugar/chocolate cravings and I love, love, LOVE soft drinks :((((

My main goals:

* Lose weight in a sustainable way (not crash dieting)
* Build habits I can actually stick to
* Improve energy levels and feel better in my body

If anyone here has experience with PCOS, insulin resistance, or starting from a similar place, I’d really appreciate hearing what worked for you. Even general beginner advice, mindset tips, or things you wish you knew earlier would help a lot.",1767600305.0,3,9,loseit,weight_loss

1q4cr09,How to lose weight and keep it off without getting obsessive?,"I 30F have a history of an eating disorder (as a teen and into my early 20s) and worked very hard to recover and heal my relationship with food! My husband and I went on vacation over December and he took a bikini photo of me and when I saw it I felt really deflated and disconnected from the pic of myself. He told me that I’d gained some weight this fall (maybe 10-15 lbs). I’m probably 155-160 at 5’6’’ if I had to guess. I hadn’t even noticed myself gain weight which is the scary part! I spiraled that day but pulled myself together and took it as a wake up call to make changes before it got out of hand. I would love to lose about 20-30 pounds and maintain that. 

I have never been able to use a scale because I get so triggered by the number and end up restricting far below what I should. My plan is to step on the scale once I feel like I’m at a weight I want to maintain and use it for monitoring maintenance. Any advice for non scale ways to keep track of progress? I know I’m 30 years old and should be able to look at the number on the scale without it affecting my behaviors and self worth but I just can’t yet…

Does anyone else have a disordered eating history who had successfully lost weight and kept it off without it going into eating disorder territory? I have daily goals of walking 10k steps, eating 1600 cals a day, and Pilates or strength training 3-4x a week. Plus, I’m trying to only eat Whole Foods 80% of the time. I’m just scared of taking it too far like I know I’m capable of doing.

1q4cnu2,"★OFFICIAL WEEKLY★ Day 1 Monday: Start here! January 05, 2026","# Is today is your Day 1?

​**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

​So you aren’t sure of how to start? Don’t worry! “How do I get started?” is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

# Why You’re Overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends (unaffiliated) apps like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit](http://loseit.com/) or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers. You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it’s own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn’t necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don’t need perfect. We just want better.

1q49lqi,A different perspective - gratitude,"I have to remind myself of this all the time: to be grateful that I can move my body.   


I am a perimenopausal female.  Historically, I have been lean but in the last few years my weight ballooned almost seemingly overnight despite eating in a (true) calorie deficit. I felt gross, as the weight gathered mostly around my middle (as is true with perimenopause). For those who don’t know, it’s not just calories in, calories out. Perimenopause sucks, and you have to fight harder. So I had to stop feeling sorry for myself and fight. 

It’s been a hard journey, but I’ve lost 15 lbs with 10 more to go to get to my ideal weight (however I would probably be considered “fit” right now by many). I’ve lost 5+ inches in just the waist. Every time I exercise, I remind myself how proud I am for consistently showing up, prioritizing my health, and also for how strong I’ve become.

Weight loss is not linear; we have good days and bad days - but just keep showing up. And find activities you enjoy. :)

This was the first year I consistently worked out 5 times/week for the entire year and I had a little help from a compound GLP-1 from my Dr’s office.  5 years ago I was around 230 and I now weigh 151!!

I have adjusted my goal down to 140 but honestly I am fine with my weight now.  My XL’s are being replaced with M’s.  I feel great and am finally seeing results in the gym.  Things I have learned:

It is easier when your spouse is also working on their weight/health.

A good fitness app helps you to be accountable.

I feel the best on a balanced diet with an emphasis on protein intake.

Exercise is the best for mood and stress!

Meal preparation is key!  I haven’t had fast food in forever and I do NOT miss it!

Before the GLP-1, I was eating good food, just too much of it.

Life is about choices.  I will take feeling this good over a pizza any day!  I can make my own pizza and feel good about it because I know what is in it and it satisfies me.

Good luck everyone on your journey.  If I have learned anything, it is consistency is the key.

1q4468e,Looking for advice -- first time getting serious about CICO,"Hi everyone, pardon this long post from a brand new person looking for advice. I read a bunch of the top posts so that's how I learned the CICO acronym!

My story in brief: I've always been overweight since childhood, with a bit of fluctuation. After college I lived outside the US for a year, and the combination of different diet (I was in the middle east) and walking a lot more caused me to lose a noticeable amount of weight. I still had a belly, I was never svelte or anything like that, but friends I hadn't seen since the prior year noticed a difference.

Over the next 5-6 years I mostly stayed that shape, but gradually the weight came back, to the point that I look at pictures of myself at that time, now 15 years later, and think 'wow, I looked good then.' My office job and raising three young kids have definitely taken their toll.

Growing up as a fat kid, my main coping mechanism was just to try not to think about my body or have it be a subject of discussion for anyone. I missed out on a lot that way. Now as an adult, I've kind of realized that I still have some of these barriers that are keeping me from being healthier. A few years ago, I started getting into cycling. I always loved riding a bike around but for whatever reason I picked up a ""serious"" road bike for the first time, and started riding longer rides: 20 miles, then 30, then pushing to 50. I learned about century rides (riding 100 miles at a time) and on an impulse I decided I was going to do it. Never in my life had I ever really attempted a serious athletic accomplishment like that, but I found some friends who were willing to sign up with me, set a training schedule, and I accomplished my goal. Now I ride two centuries every year, and try to ride at least 30-40 miles every week, more when the weather is good.

I'm really proud of learning to love what my body can do on a bike. But up to now I have still been avoiding the ""calories in"" half of the equation, as part of my generally avoidant approach to thinking about my body. So that means I'm a fat guy on a bike. I'm not huge, but my weight is around 205/210 at 5'11"", which for a bike rider is heavy. And I feel the impact -- I don't climb nearly as well as the friends I ride with, my stamina is worse, I get back pain more easily, etc. I've had to recognize that I am at a serious plateau in my training and I'm not going to get faster unless I lose some weight.

So I'm trying to overcome my learned avoidant behaviors about my body to do something about Calories In. I eat a lot of junk, if I'm being honest. It's how I grew up. Candy, chips, the usual stuff. I have managed to make some good lifestyle changes -- I quit drinking six years ago, for example. And I am almost entirely vegetarian. But I'm clearly bringing in way too many calories, and the weight is noticeable.

Ok, that's my not so short story. What I'm here to ask is what other people in similar situations to me (late 30s, raising kids, somewhat physically active but overweight, sweet tooth) would suggest trying to manage calories in a healthy and realistic way? I'm overwhelmed by all the things people are trying here. Should I incorporate fiber supplements? Meal plan? Do intermittent fasting? All of the above? I get decision fatigue easily so I guess I'm looking for some direction. Do you have specific suggestions? Books/Youtube channels that would connect with someone like me? I'm open to it all.

1q441uw,I lost 10 lbs,"I wanted to share this here because I’m kind of being private right now about my weight loss journey. I want to be successful in silence as I start out.

Anyway, I am a teacher and during my two week holiday break I said a goal to lose 10 pounds. I started out at 232 lbs and I’m now at 222 lbs. I’m so excited I reached this goal.

To do this, I kept within a calorie deficit. It wasn’t strict or anything, I just made sure the deficit for the week was within the amount needed for my BMR/TDEE. I had egg bites for breakfast. They were usually loaded up with kimchi, sausage, cheese, and seasonings. For lunch and dinner I had my meal prepped rice bowls. I usually did either a chicken or a ground turkey meat bulgogi, with zucchini and a half cup of rice. And for a snack, I ate a cucumber. Lol. I would slice a whole one up on my mandolin and add cream cheese and imitation crab with some other seasonings to it.

But it wasn’t all strict meal prep foods. One day I was craving a baked potato, so I made one. And I made some shredded chicken to go on top of it and just kept it within my nutritional guidelines. I feel like my biggest take away is to just make sure I am being considerate of my portions. And also that I’m eating enough. Right now my calorie range is 1400 to 1600 cal while I’m in my weight loss. My TDEE is about 2200, so I actually try to stay on the 1600 side of things.

But yeah, I just wanted to share my milestone. I have a goal to lose about one to 2 pounds a week. My next milestone is to be at least 216 lbs by 2/1/26. I understand this first ten lbs was probably a lot of water weight and bloating. And my next goal for February is going to be much more realistic. ",1767566588.0,135,12,loseit,weight_loss

I have recently been told by a PT that because I have been underrating, my metabolism has slowed down and I need to gain muscle before cutting again and to do a lean bulk.

My current protocol is Oatmeal in the morning which is of Oats, Chia seeds, Fruits, protein powder and creatine but the issue is this meals comes out to be 750kcal overall and then lunch and dinner. I am not sure if this is actually true but I always stress out that my breakfast is a massive meal which is leading to the fat again regardless of me keeping to my calories throughout the day. I dont want to skip my oatmeal because it is almost 50% of my fibre needs in a day and close to 45% of overall protein intake for the day. (Currently aiming at 2.2g/kg of weight).

Has anyone faced such issues before ? Would love some thoughts or opinions on this and also on what the PT said.

Each app seems to have a different approach. Improving gut health, fasting, avoiding ultra-processed food etc. What approach has worked for you? Has anyone lost weight and actually kept it off. Please I am not looking for ""it's all calories in vs out"", I have tried it, gained the weight back. It's not long term sustainable.

1q3xtrg,40 years later - this time it will work,"Posting for accountability but also for some blunt honesty with myself and would love feedback / tips / all of it.

I was raised on fad diets in the 70s/80s. My mom during my life was a 10-16 size, gym teacher, and nutritionist who missed her size 6 self and yo yo dieted until she was 70 and got bariatric surgery (which is a whole other thing). But pick a fad diet and I tried it.

I was an active kid on the chubby side but not extended clothes sizing. Water skiing, swimming, dance class, aerobics videos, weightlifting, cross country running, gymnastics for fun - you name it I probably loved it. Growing up in and around gyms didn’t hurt. Get bored - play on the parallel bars. It was all still just play. We ate… ok. Everything was microwaved. Lots of diet soda and processed food. My parents are ice cream every night. Portions were… Midwestern. 

When I started college I had a cafeteria plan and 1000% less activity even though I walked / biked everywhere and had some dance classes. And I gained 120lbs. And then the next summer I went on birth control - and gained another 50. 

Since then (1993?) I’ve been mostly within 20lbs above to below the 300 mark. There was a moment in the early / mid 2000s where I did Atkins for 3 years (and lived in a 4th floor walk up) and lost 120lbs.  But the depression from nutritional gaps was real. So I tried to go back to more balanced eating and … within about 3 years… back to the 300 line.

My wife, my friends are all naturally thin people. We have a pretty active life - I’m 5000 steps a day on average during the work week and 8-10k on the weekends.

Now I’m in my early 50s and my body is unhappy about carrying this weight. I seem to tweak / injure my knee about 2x a year, my ankles constantly give me pain, my back always hurts, and I find myself begging off of fun things I used to love because I’m worried about pain or injury.

I have the shoe inserts and compression socks which help but damn.

So about a month ago I joined the gym. Have made it in 1-4x a week since. I’m trying to figure out how to enable my friends to help. I don’t want to be whiny or seem weak but also - I don’t want this to kill me or impair my mobility. I love to travel, dance, perform on stage (I’m a musician), walk everywhere - and right now carrying this weight is hurting my quality of life so much. I want to let it go. 

Somehow this feels different than other years. I don’t want it to be just another fad diet like when I was a kid.

I tried ozembic a few years ago but stopped it b/c I was afraid of the blindness side effect. I tried metformin but couldn’t tolerate the side effects (and it didn’t help much). I tried one of the speedier weight loss drugs and ended up in afib. Contrave wasn’t impactful. I’m asking my dr re monjauro when she is back from vacation. 

This journey feels so hard and also - I’m ready to start it. Not for vanity but for longevity. Every day is a choice. Wish me luck!

What have you found helpful for your friends / spouses to do to support your journey? I want to ask for help but… what can they do when the choices are all mine ?",1767552159.0,8,9,loseit,weight_loss

Over the recent holidays I've been logging meals and cooking, combined with exercise - and it is showing results, where I'm 3kg down from the past 3 weeks. 

The problem is I'm returning to 3 days a week of being in the office soon, where the eating culture is more unhealthy. I used to join them for the morning lattes, full lunches, sometimes drinks before the weekend. I'm intending to bring my meals to the office if possible, and cut down on buying the coffees (and maybe just join for their strolls to the cafe so that I don't miss out on the socializing), but want to do all this/ phrase things in a manner where I'm not seen as anti-social or ""fussy.""

1q3xcud,Starting Again and Paying Attention This Time,"I’m sitting at my kitchen island right now, doing something I never thought I’d do. I’m writing about myself, even though I hate writing.

I’m not really sure what I’m doing here yet, but this feels like a place to start.

Hey everyone. I’m Andy.

Last year, starting right after New Year’s, I was at my heaviest weight at 250 pounds. I felt horrible most of the time. Low energy, uncomfortable in my own body, and mentally foggy in a way that made even simple days feel heavier than they needed to be.

Between January and July, I lost about 40 pounds. I stayed consistent, worked hard, and felt better physically and mentally than I had in years. My confidence came back. I trusted myself again. I was reminded that when I put my mind to something, I know I can do it.

As the summer went on, that consistency slowly slipped. My routine loosened, structure faded, and old habits found their way back in. Progress did not disappear all at once, but it did fade as I stopped being intentional with my time and attention.

This year, I want to approach things differently.

I work as a business analyst and recently started going back to school for business administration. I also work a hybrid schedule. That flexibility can be a gift, but it also means structure is something I have to actively create. When I do, I thrive. When I don’t, days blur together and good intentions get postponed.

I’m posting here to document the process honestly. I plan to post a couple times a week, especially when something feels worth reflecting on. Some updates will be quick check ins. Others will be more thoughtful.

My goal this time is not just weight loss, even though that is part of it. The bigger goal is consistency. I want routines that hold up when work gets busy, school ramps up, or motivation dips.

If you’re starting again this year, or trying to rebuild after losing momentum, you’re not alone.

Here’s to beginning again with more awareness than last time.",1767551112.0,6,8,loseit,weight_loss
1q3wso3,My first 10k and 40 pounds down!,"Hey all, i started running last summer, around early August. When i started i weighted close to 275 pounds, i would run at night because i was ashamed people would see big guy all sweaty and almost dying while he was trying to run. My first time running i couldn't do more than one minute before being out of breath, running 3KM would take all i have, i remember i was breathing and making noises as if i was going to die the whole time. I then decided to push too much, too fast and injured myself.

Smart me decided to keep running on my injured ankle and knee, the result was that i could barely walk let alone run for close to a month, that's when i learned to listen to my body and that ''becoming a runner'' wasn't an overnight thing, i would maybe get there through perseverance and by being patient.

Fast forward to November, i was doing 5k five days a week. In December when i felt comfy with my 5k i decided to push it to 6k daily, then 7k. I once did 8k and was pretty proud, i thought i had gave all i could.

Today was my 9th consecutive day, i did 8k yesterday and this morning i decided to try going for 10k and i did it! I'm pretty proud of where i come from and what i've done so far.

This year for Xmas, i gave myself a registration to the Montreal Half Marathon in October of this year. I have 270 days to prepare. I have still much to learn about running. I always run on an empty stomach, don't put much thinking about drinking before or during, but i think i will need to dial into some things if i want to succeed in a 21k.

I'm now down to 230 pounds, still sweaty, still overweight, but i don't care what others might think. I run for my health, mental and physical. I run for myself. Happy new year!",1767549852.0,18,3,loseit,weight_loss

I'm 23f and obese. I'm currently over 90 Kgs. I've always been on the heavier side of the scale and struggled to lose weight.

It always ends up with me losing 2-3 kgs max getting demotivated, disappointed and discontinuing. As a result everytime I restart I am at a higher weight than the last time. It has led me to getting this horrible mindset and honestly it makes everything worse. 

I have also worked with PTs but where I live (UAE) PTs are too expensive and it's not financially feasible for me to afford them in long term. 

This is the highest I've ever weighed and I'm tired of feeling disappointed in my body and my efforts.

Pretty sure the last time I went to the doctor and got blood work done they told me I was near (or in) the stages of pre-diabetes and that was at least a year ago now. Up until this month I’ve been walking 10k+ steps a day since the summer and have maintained pretty much the same weight. I also practically only ever drink water. Soda on average once a week (if that). 

In terms of my diet I admittedly over indulge in junk food especially spicy chips and sweat treats. It’s definitely worse when I’m at home for the holidays & breaks as compared to when I’m at college eating at scheduled times in the dinning hall. I want to get my eating habits under control but it’s especially hard when I’m at home since often times there are little ‘healthy options’. Most of our food is processed and refined carb heavy because that’s what is affordable. I’m going to attempt going low-to-no refined carbs & sugars including bread, tortillas, sweat treats, etc. so basically I’m going to try to get most if not all of my carbs from fruits and veggies. 

As for workouts I have no idea where to start. I’m a fan of walking so while I’m at college in a safe controlled environment I’ll go on 20-40 minutes walks or hop on the treadmill for 30-40 minutes. But I want to lose my tummy for good. We have two gyms on campus so equipment isn’t a problem. What are some workouts I can start with doing that will help me build consistent routines.

I’ll share mine to get the conversation going.

1. Food became too accessible.
Late-night food delivery was a big habit for me. Ordering supper and eating alone in my room became my quiet time, the only real peace in an otherwise hectic life. Over time, food turned into a crutch. I used it to reward myself on good days, bad days, and everything in between. 
- Solution: Exercised during my me times instead of eating my feelings. 

2. My home environment made it harder.
My family eats poorly and, due to chronic health issues, isn’t able to exercise. Since about 90% of my meals are shared with them, I had to adapt. 
- Solution : Instead of fighting it, I started finding the healthiest options at our usual food spots and squeezing in exercise whenever I had time on my own.

3. Constant food advertising.
Food is marketed everywhere, and I’m easily influenced by it. 
- Solution : I eventually realized how much it was affecting my cravings, so I stopped watching food videos and food-related content altogether. That one change alone made a noticeable difference. I really wish that food isn't as prominent though.

I haven't done a calorie deficit since I worked an office job. I like the food I'm eating, it's just a slog. I yearn for pizza from my local pizza place real bad some days, but mentally I say no, that's not within our goal. Even though I'm injured I've found ways to work around it.

Some days, rice, meats veggies and fruits leave me wanting for pizza, even though it satiates me until my next meal, and a small snack, usually a pickle or two, or i weigh out some sunflower kernels. Replaced my coffee creamer with half and half or unsweetened oatmill, which is totally fine with me.

I just struggle thinking about the next meal of the day. I meal prep so it's whatever, I'm going to eat it regardless.

Does anyone else have this issue?",1767514060.0,4,17,loseit,weight_loss

I know most of it is probably water weight from all the carbs and salt but I need to get back on track before it becomes actual fat.

Problem is I absolutely cannot do restrictive dieting. Last time I tried I lasted 4 days then binged on everything in sight. It's like my body goes into panic mode and I end up eating way more than if I'd just eaten normally. 

For context, I'm 5'6"" and currently sitting at 139lbs. My normal weight is around 131lbs so this 8lb jump is really noticeable on my frame. 

I work a desk job so I'm sitting most of the day, which doesn't help. I try to walk during lunch but with the cold weather I've been skipping it lately.

1q3j63q,Having a smartwatch really gamifies and motivates you to burn calories,"Hey guys,

A few months ago I got a cheap smartwatch , I won't say which so I won't be accused of advertising anyone (I whole heartedly recommend it and I don't mind saying which brand is it in DMs), and it really makes me just move more

I want that at the end of the day it will always say that I burned 1000 calories or more (even though I know it isn't 100% accurate \[save those comments, I know it, cmon\]), and that makes it so I am far more likely to just be more active

Like, in days where I don't have time to go to the gym, I will sometimes just walk back home from college instead of taking the bus, or play some active games in VR, things that if I didn't have the watch I would likely would not have done otherwise

I know it's terribly written, I am a little tired, but I thought that I would just throw it out there, it's a (relatively) tiny investment that imho makes a huge difference so I am just gonna throw it out there in case it helps someone ",1767509755.0,122,20,loseit,weight_loss

Long time lurker first time poster here. Ive decided this is the year i am going to really get serious about losing my covid weight.

I signed up for a competition through my gym that includes 5 body scans to track our progress and I did my first one today! 

I have about 40 pounds to lose. I lost about 30 last year and gained back about 10 but it still counts as a win and I’ve been taking what I learned last year into hopefully getting where I want to be this year. 

My question is - it says on here that my BMR is 1691 kcal. When I’ve been trying to lose weight before I looked at my BMR online and it says 1900ish so I was eating about 1500-1700 calories a day but not seeing the scale move much. Should I follow what this one says and focus on trying to eat more like 1300-1400 a day? It just seems a little low. 

Since I can’t post the scan, I am currently 216lbs and hoping to get down to 175ish.

1q3egv0,Being back in the gym is a revelation,"In 2018, I started a gym habit where I went to the gym 5-6 times a week and did a thorough cardio workout, stretch, and weights (intermittently.) I got down to my lowest weight, had tons of energy, felt happy and motivated, etc. Kept it up for a few years and then began to backslide after I started nursing school. 

It’s been a couple of years since I went to the gym consistently and for the last six months I think I only went ONE time. I kept my membership because I knew I wanted to go back but couldn’t find the motivation. 

For the last week I have gone 5 out of 7 days and I already notice a huge change. My mood is so much lighter, I am not sleeping as much but my sleep quality is better, my libido has even improved. 

I am trying not to beat myself up about my failure and just reveling in how good it feels to be back. I can’t wait to get back to my prior fitness level (and weight!) and I am excited about how the improvement in my mental health is going to affect other areas of my life.

1q36kju,My 2026 Weight-Loss Adjacent Goal: Do the Monkey Bars,"I do a bit better with specific fitness goals vs. number goals.  For example, in 2024, I decided to train and run a 50k race and I did.  In 2025, I failed to set or keep any significant goals (it was a very depressing year).  Didn't even do much running and gained some weight.

Anyway, I realized a month or so ago that I (37F) cannot do the monkey bars...this after I tried to follow my ten-year-old across and wrenched my shoulder hard, lol.  Can't remember the last time I did them successfully, but probably not since I was a young teenager.  So I have decided that for my first goal of the year, I will work up to being able to do them again properly by building grip strength, training upper body, and losing some weight.

My doctor also wants me to work on my cholesterol, so I plan to tweak my diet as well and just see what happens.

Steps: alternate hands with a grip strengthener while cruising/idling in the car, install a pull up bar (did that today) and attempt a under- or over-hand hang (and eventually a pull up) every time I go through that doorway, do an AM/PM set of pushups and curls, and stop by the park a couple times a week to do some experimental swings/hangs on the monkey bars.

Specific diet changes: no more daily coffee with cream, high-fiber vs high fat breakfast, smaller portions at dinner.

1q35pds,Scale weight not dropping,"Looking for some sort of reassurances, but also some explanations! My scale weight is not dropping - I went from 79kg to 73.7kg in the space of 8 months, but that went up to 75.3 kg as of last week. In that time, I have dropped 6.25 inches on my waist and 7 inches on my hips and there is a definite change in progress pictures. I've also decreased my calories to 1450 a day (progressive decrease), and now work out doing 45 minutes of cardio 4x a week, average 10-12k steps a day and strength training 2x a week - this was a massive increase in exercise from when I first started at 79kg. I also drink 2-3l of water a day when I might have drunk  maybe one glass beforehand. 
I'm trying to not let the scale weight get me down, but it's very frustrating to not see the shift, especially as I am on it with the nutrition (eat around 120-140g of protein a day). I know scale weight is not the be all and end all, but I am just co confused as to why it isn't going down, especially as medical professionals judge so heavily based on what the numbers say.

1q34sco,How do you build stamina to work out when you’re unmotivated and tired?,"I’m trying to get into exercising consistently, but I’m struggling with two big things: I don’t feel motivated, and I genuinely feel like I don’t have the stamina to go for 30 minutes to an hour without breaks. When I first started I could exercise for over 30 minutes. 

Today I ran for 10 minutes on the treadmill and did 15 minutes of cycling. I don't feel like I'm doing enough and I want to lose more weight. 

It’s not that I *don’t want* to be healthier, I do, but when it’s time to work out I feel mentally resistant, physically low-energy, or both. I’ll start and feel tired fast, or I’ll just talk myself out of it completely.

So I’m wondering:  
How did you personally build your stamina when you were starting from a low-energy, low-motivation place?  
Did you start super small and build up? Did your energy improve over time? Was there something that helped you mentally push through or physically feel better?

I’m looking for sustainable ways people got themselves from “I don’t feel like it and I’m tired” to “this is just part of my routine now.”

Would love to hear what worked for you.",1767471130.0,35,54,loseit,weight_loss
1q341nf,Advice on best target daily kcal intake?,"I'm a 26yo woman. I'm 169cm en weigh 79,9kg. My bmr should be around 1564 then. My ideal goal is to lose 15kg in 5-6 months. But because my weight has always fluctuated around 68-69kg since I was 14 and because that's a healthy weight, I'd set that as my main goal and see if losing a bit more is realistic to maintain.
I started tracking kcal today and my app set my target daily kcal intake at 1640 after a long questionaire. I know I just started but that seems a little bit too low to start with. I'd rather slowly decrease the daily target.

Activity level:

+ I started gradually building up my running training since last week. I was quite fit untill 6 months ago. I even ran a half marathon last year under 2h. But I started slacking off the last couple months. But because my running history, I'm quite disciplined and excited to start running regularly again.
-> Now I run every other day. 5k medium pace. One slow longer run the weekend if I feel like it (6-8k). I'm gonna start running longer distances once I feel like my body is adjusted to avoid unjury ofc.
--> do I change (/increase) my daily caloric intake according to my activity level for more realistic results? Or do I risk overcompensating?


So what is a good daily kcal intake for me do you think? Or is 1640 good and I just need more time to adjust? Any advice is very welcome ! Thank you in advance !

1q33vt8,"Just saw a report that 3 in 4 US adults are now considered obese. It’s a terrifying stat, but honestly, looking back at how I used to live, I completely get it.","I was reading through this Yahoo News article this morning and the 75% number really stuck with me. Tbh, it’s a bit of a reality check.

I’m 32 now, and I spent almost my entire 20s as part of that statistic. At my heaviest (162lbs at 5'4), I felt constantly puffy, exhausted, and honestly just stuck. Because I have ADHD, I was the queen of dopamine snacking, I’d run on coffee and sugar all day just to survive my work marathons, only to crash and binge at night.

Seeing these stats makes me realize that we aren't just lazy. Our environment is basically designed to make us fail. Between the hidden sugars in everything and the high-stress jobs, willpower alone is a losing strategy.

What finally helped me break out of that cycle and get down to 134lbs this year wasn't a sudden burst of discipline. It was admitting that I’m human and I needed a real system to navigate the madness. I stopped winging it and followed a roadmap that focused on high-satiety meals and mental resets so I didn't have to ""think"" when I was tired.

It’s scary to think that being healthy is now the ""exception"" rather than the rule.

1q333t6,Honest question,"So this isn't my first rodeo.  Im 41m about a month in on my third attempt in my life to losing weight and getting healthy.  6 feet tall I always generally get to like the 275 pound mark and two times I've gotten down to 215 pds.  My perfect skinny weight is 196.

Essentially just trying to make this 3rd attempt the charm.  In back of my mind I dont ever want to gain this weight back again.  I'm about a month in, weight currently at 253.  I do know what you eat is more important than anything else so dont really need many answers to that.

This is where my question comes in.  My theory wants to do this because I want to look good in the end.  I find it damn near impossible in my body shape to both gain muscle and lose fat unless you want to look like an offensive lineman.  Id prefer the linebacker physique.  Am I right in doing cardio and eating great to slim down as much as I can before ultimately switching more to weight training/ some cardio?

Im just curious on best approach opinions.  Like I said I've gotten to 215 twice in my life.  Just want to know if you think it's a bad idea to go that way or not?",1767467278.0,6,24,loseit,weight_loss

1q32ayf,Confused about the list my dietician gave me,"Hello,

I am writing this post because honestly I'm just so confused.  
I started working with a dietician this month, and its our second week. I am attaching the list she gave me for the second week.

Breakfast

* 30 g oats
* 100 ml almond milk
* 15 g protein powder
* 1 teaspoon unsweetened peanut butter
* 1 portion of season fruits
* cacao or cinnamon for taste

during the day

* 200ml of kefir
* half a tbsp chia seeds
* black coffee
* no sugar added protein bar under 200kcal

Dinner

* 120 grams of chicken/fish/meat grilled and a salad of greens with maximum of half a tbsp of olive oils
* 2 tbsp greek yogurt
* 1 slice(25g) integral bread or 2 wasa

when you add all these up, its under 1000kcals, today was first day of following this, and i honestly felt so hungry. so i asked her why it was so low on kcal,  she accused me of not trusting her, basicly told me to use chatgpt if im not going to trust her, then told me that she doesnt want to continue working with me.

Honestly I'm in shock. I didn't mean to question her in a bad way, but i was not feeling good with this list.

For reference I'm 74kg 21f 163cm. Not doing sports but fairly active during the day.

Curious to see what you guys think, am i the asshole?

Update: Pretty sure she is a licenced dietician. She has an office and a diploma.  
To be clear this was not the first question I asked. For example she asked me not to drink coke zero, and i asked if there was an other reason than health concerns and I was stubborn about it.  Or last week I was asked for substitudes for some of the things she wrote. Maybe she was annoyed.  
She also told me that a dietician's job is not to explain the reason behind everything, but to make meal plans suitable for the clients. said that if i want to learn about it more i should get an education about it.  
After that she explained how current TDEE calculators are outdated, that dieticians have a different way of  calculating these things, and her meal plan is perfectly healthy and its not just about the calories.

1q2yiof,I’m Down a Size and Starbucks Knows 🥴,"Calling all caffeine loving adults and emotional support latte holders ☕️🫡

I have acquired an offensive amount of Starbucks gift cards for Christmas. Over $100. They are currently sitting in my wallet like a legal obligation. According to my mother, they’re “burning a hole in my pocket,” and frankly, I feel very threatened by them.

Serious question for the Starbucks enjoying, weight loss attempting community:
Has anyone successfully lost weight while still maintaining a toxic but manageable relationship with Starbucks?

My holiday order (my annual flaw) is a grande iced sugar cookie oat latte with 1 pump sugar cookie and 2 maybe 3 pumps sugar free vanilla. I order it every holiday season like it’s a sacred ritual passed down by the Starbucks ancestors themselves. HOWEVER… I do not want to undo my progress for festive vibes and oat milk. Especially because I am already down a size in my Lululemon leggings and I’m way too proud of myself to let Starbucks take that away from me.

Logically, I know moderation exists.
Emotionally, I am staring at these gift cards like they personally want me to fail everything I achieved. 
I just need reassurance from people who’ve survived Starbucks and seasonal syrups without launching their goals directly into the espresso machine.

For context, I only go to Starbucks when I get gift cards for Christmas. No gift cards equals no Starbucks. This is a once a year, seasonal, emotionally charged event.
Please drop your success stories, low cal swaps, coping mechanisms, or emotional support. Thank you for your helping me during this terrible time. 🥲🫶🏻

Yes, we notice the influx of people. But we don't care. No decent person us looking for who is new. We say hi to our friends, but that's not excluding you, that's just seeing the same person multiple times a week for a year. We aren't staring at you. People stare at themselves in the gym or the abyss or their phones. We aren't seeking out the newbies. We don't care about your weight. I've been here for a year and I'm possibly fatter than you. 

If you don't know what to do, start with cardio and observe. Use Google. Ask questions. Please don't hurt yourself. You can't be here for a year straight if you need to take an injury break. Follow gym etiquette. Don't take up multiple machinrs at once. Put your shit away (seriously today the gym is in the worst shape I've ever seen). Wipe down your shit. Get into a schedule. Stick to it. Hydrate. Have fun.

1q2ye5q,Any advice to get back on track,"Been trying to lose the weight I gained during my 3rd pregnancy, started when I was 6 weeks postpartum (now almost 9months postpartum). I was 262lbs in May, now I am 231lbs as of this morning. I do have PCOS and hashimotos (on metformin and levothyroxine) working against my weight loss but I’m seeing my endocrinologist every 6 weeks at this point and my primary (who specializes in weightloss) every 3 months. My primary put me on 1800 calories and I was doing pretty well on it when I started it but lately I’ve been struggling on keeping my calories at that, I’ve been averaging 2-3 days a week at 2000-2100 which is definitely inhibiting the weightloss I’m aiming for. I keep craving sugar and carbs at night everyday now.

My exercise routine is Monday: 30min walk at home program Tuesday: 30min strength training on YouTube Wednesday: Strength training again Thursday: Walk at home again Friday: free for all, exercise or don’t Saturday: Rest day Sunday: Pilates

Prior to my 3rd pregnancy, I started at 280 after I gave birth to my 2nd and ended up going down to 209 before I got pregnant again. I was doing 1800 calories and exercising 6 days a week with just the walk at home program; so I’m wondering if I should go back to that, but also I didn’t have this craving of sugar/carbs like I do now. My doctor does want me to keep up with the strength training so I don’t lose muscle.

Most calculators out there do it by your poundage goal for the week. So 1 pound a week, 2 pounds a week and bases your calories for the day on that. I want it to calculate it by reducing an amount of calories that I will then reach my 15 pound goal slowly by end of 2026.

I don’t just “diet” — I restrict heavily, obsess over food, calories, rules, and timing, and food takes over my entire brain. I can’t focus, I can’t function, and my life starts falling apart.
When I stop trying to control my eating, I go to the opposite extreme. I binge a lot, feel completely out of control, and physically awful — but mentally I function better. I’m productive, focused, and able to live my life. I’ve lost large amounts of weight very quickly (45 lbs in two months) and gained it all back multiple times.
So it feels like I’m stuck between two disorders: • Restriction/anorexic behaviors → mental collapse
Binge eating → physical and emotional misery
Either way, food controls my life and my self-worth is tied to my body. The self-hatred just keeps the cycle going.
I’ve tried therapy, but I can’t bring myself to tell the full truth about my eating. I downplay or lie because I’m scared of being judged or having control taken away, so I never actually get help.

The truth is, progress made sense in my body long before it made sense in my head  
I was doing things that worked, but I wasn’t consciously aware of the patterns yet  
Sharing forced me to slow down and actually notice what I was repeating, what I was avoiding, and what I kept coming back to

It also showed me how easy it is to underestimate clarity. Not discipline, not motivation, but understanding what your own process actually looks like. Once I started paying attention to that, things felt lighter and less chaotic

Posting wasn’t about showing results anymore, It became a way to understand myself better and make progress feel less random

I'm not sure about the exact estimate, but this all combined is probably over 500-700 (or above)  calories, when you add ghee calorie as well.
Didn't use vegetable oil, ghee is healthier.

I live a very lazy life I barely move so my ideal calorie budget is 1200 but its really difficult to maintain it because I keep getting hungry unless I eat a good amount of carbs (eg rice or roti) and the more I try to limit my calorie the more I end up over eating

I've reduced rice a little,  from eating it everyday to a few times per week.  Roti is much better but I want to keep it 1 roti per day, preferably for dinner.


I'm super frustrated. ",1767429599.0,0,27,loseit,weight_loss

1q2m34i,Eating more to lose weight,"I have had the same diet for a long time - I basically

starve myself due to no appetite from meds, then I’d eat at night just a regular meal. I was basically starving my body and then eating only at night.

This caused weight gain > than 20 pounds. I’m working with a dietician, and we think due to that and seroquol (which I’m getting off of) caused the weight gain.

So now she wants me to eat MORE. So I start my day with coffee, a protein shake, and some fruit, usually do crackers cheese and fruit for lunch, and then a roughly 900 calorie dinner.

She said my metabolism slowed down due to the starvation and that’s why I’m putting on weight, and I have to eat more to get it to start up again.

Has anyone ever heard of this?

I starved myself for a long time due to meds and I was tiny, I kinda thought if I kept starving myself I’d keep the weight down but this apparently isn’t the case?

I’m not advocating for EDs, I just would forget to eat due to ADHD/adhd meds.

I also don’t really enjoy eating most of the time, so I just force food down.

How can I force myself to get more calories? Has anyone ever heard of eating MORE to lose weight? So far I’ve gained 10 pounds on this diet, which she says is so be expected til my metabolism kicks up again.

I was a healthy pregnancy and my doctor said I gained the right amount of weight for the size of the baby. The weight just won’t come off. My husband has admitted that he finds me less attractive now and that he would like to see me healthy again. He’s given some advice but losing weight is different for men vs women. I’m trying to lose 115 pounds in a year if possible. Without veering into ED territory as I suffered from extreme dieting habits in high school which is considered disordered eating. I have a toddler so I’m moderately active but I have severe back problems due to the pregnancy and weight. I also have a hard time walking or running long distances because of injuries from cheer in school. I’m trying my best but it’s just not good enough. I eat like a bird (I’m not hungry very often due to ADHD forgetting to remind me to eat lol) but I still can’t lose weight. I’m getting checked for PCOS in February which can make it hard to lose weight I’m just wanting extra advice from strangers who might’ve been in the same predicament.

1q2eor8,Advice on Losing Weight,"Hello, I (F17) am currently trying to lose weight. I am 5'5 (165cm) and around 169lbs (77kg) but my weight does fluctuate. I suffer from near constant knee pain, and between commitments for work, study, co-curriculars and such, I rarely am able to find time for exercise. Between my home and social life this year, I have also found myself struggling to get out of bed whenever I do have free time, and at one point I had lost all motivation to do anything at all.  I dislike exercise which is hard on my knees, so I only really swim, but due to where I live and my financial situation, this isn't always accessible.

I tried tracking calories and increasing my exercise in 2025, but between poor mental health, more sedentary lifestyle, and a massively increased general workload, I've found it very hard. I want to lose weight, as I've started to gain noticeably over the last 6 months to a year. I used to be about 15kg (33lbs) lighter, and I would like to get down to this weight again by the end of the year, maybe before that if its possible. 

My family have been very limited in their helpfulness. My brother basically lives like a monk, and only eats like, super clean organic high protein stuff. My parents on the other hand have always been on the heavier side as a result of very poor mental and physical health, and highly demanding jobs. I have basically inhereted all their bad habits with food, such as a reliance on things like energy drinks, and they also get annoyed when I try to eat less carbs or smaller portion sizes, claiming I need to eat more. 


Does anyone have tips on exercise which is low strain on the knees? Or diet plans which may be helpful to someone who finds themself often reliant on highly sugary/caffienated drinks and foods to keep going?

1q2ebe1,Planning to lose 25-30 lbs: How can I minimize loose skin throughout and after this process?,"I am already down 3 lbs, I'm on my way from 150 to 120-125. 5'3""

I was 100-120 at my worst of my ED in early adulthood. 120-130 for a long time while in a management phase. Then shot up to 140 over a few months, with an increase to 150 over a few more, which I plateaued at for another few. This was great for me in a way because I overcame my eating disorder and learned to manage my body dysmorphia. I'm working on loss not just for aesthetics but primarily fitness and mobility.

I understand that loose skin will be unavoidable during and after this much weight loss. Even though it's not really extreme and I wasn't above my ideal weight range for more than about 9 months. I'm most concerned about my abdominal shape.

I'm hoping to find a balance between embracing this and managing it. I think it will be better for me if I try to at least partially integrate habits to minimize loose skin while losing the weight, so that it's not as jarring or intimidating to handle once I've met my goal weight.

I'm eating in a notable but safe deficit, watching fats, staying high in protein and fiber.

I swim multiple times a week (both leisurely and intensive drills), do a Hot 30 set (sauna yoga) daily, and am starting to hit machines/weights as much as I swim. More passively, I get a fair bit of steps in on nature walks when weather allows and during daily dog training. I also dance recreationally and occasionally toy around with Pilates.

The tips I've seen so far are: Time, working abs (of course), building glutes/hips/back to pull skin around the torso a bit, gelatin, vitamin C... Any more specifics I should know about while I'm building my weightlifting/strength/resistance routines?",1767396773.0,0,4,loseit,weight_loss

After my second daughter in late 2020 I saw over 190 on the scale (I’m 5’4”) and something finally clicked in my brain. I got down to 149 lbs by the end of 2021 through calorie counting, exercise and intermittent fasting. I felt fucking amazing. I looked fucking amazing. Then we were called back to the office in 2022 and my workout routine went out the window. Gained 5 or so lbs no big deal. Then 2023, more work stress and ditched my eating windows. Today… I’m sure you can see where this is going… I got on the scale and saw 190. 

Just so sad to have to start this over. I remember finally thinking I had cracked the code and would keep it off. I managed to stay below 160 for over two years. And now … back where I started.

1q2chfd,Calf pain from running while restricting.,"So i´ve been running on a threadmill to lose weight, a bit over 5 mph for an hour everyday. With diet restrictions, I went from 147 to 130 lbs (5'9 and male) in about 2 months. The problem is that i've started to get some horrible pain in my calves, similar to cramps, enough to not be able to walk. I rested for two weeks and started running every other day but i'm still getting those cramps, albeit weaker. I do dynamic warmups and increase speed gradually. Has anybody had similar experiences? How to I avoid this? Sorry if this isn't the right place.",1767392333.0,0,9,loseit,weight_loss
1q2bppe,NSV and LOL,"45f, SW 231, CW 204. (5’8.5”— 173 cm, about 93kg) No goal weight, just a goal body, a goal feeling of being strong and healthy when I’m older. 

So I’ve lost some weight over the last 10 months or so, I’m loving it. My weight loss has completely stalled, but my body fat and shape are continuing to change from strength training. I started out at size 16-18 and 2XL, now I’m about 12-14 and L. My body fat is down by about 8%. I’m looking similar to how I was in my 20s and it’s great.

So today I’m putting away laundry and I thought I would try on some “goal pants.” These pants are marked size 14 but I didn’t try them on when I bought them and they are smaller than anything else I have. Put them on today, zipped ‘em right up. Okay, these are now wearable pants, great.

So I thought, let me try on those old jeans I bought about 20 years ago and have literally never worn. I saved them because I wanted to wear them so bad and they were so cute and now I’m 45. Put the jeans on, instant red flag: why is the zipper so short?! The zipper is like 2 inches long! These are non-stretch low rise jeans from 2005. I have about 3 inches of granny panties sticking out the top and then the fluffiest muffin top you ever saw.

But you guys… I put them on and zipped them up. I even walked down stairs in them to show my husband who dutifully did not laugh even though I gave him permission. This is an NSV with no real world application except that I have literally never buttoned these jeans before today. I am delighted and just wanted to share. No pics because I promise nobody wants to see my surgery scars and generic undies.",1767390501.0,35,7,loseit,weight_loss
1q2bbzr,7 years after weight gain - this year I’m finally all in,"I’ve struggled massively with my weight since Covid hit. Prior to the lockdowns I was working out 5 days a week and kept my weight off for 8 years. Maintained 135lbs that whole time. But then when Covid hit I continued to gain weight. I also went back to school at age 30 and had fluctuations in losing and gaining. 

I weighed myself on NYE and was absolutely heartbroken at what I saw. I currently sit at 177lbs and have only 2 pairs of jeans that I fit in. 

At the start of 2025 I was committed to getting back into shape and gained quite a bit of muscle. My mistake was not counting calories. I assumed I was eating enough to lose weight - and so I went from 165 to 177 in about 3 months from October to December.

Joining this group and reading all of your experiences have really woken me up to the fact that you HAVE to count calories. Since the 1st I have been and I’ve been so shocked seeing how much food is in 1500 calories and that I really have been overeating for years! (I joke though and say I’ve just been in bulking season for the last year haha).

If any of you are feeling down like me, start counting your calories. Especially if you’re already active. I look forward to checking in with myself 6 months from now and I finally believe that I can achieve my goal of 135-140 again because I’m 100% dialled in.

If any of you have tips that helped with your weight loss I’d love to hear them.

1q2ai9y,What are your thoughts on juicing?,"I have a friend who swears by juicing as a meal replacement to cut calories.

She says it helps her lose weight and cut fat, and she's not concerned about sugar intake as much as she is with cutting calories in general.

I want to know people's thoughts on this. I don't really think it is a safe or sustainable option myself but it's working for her and I have to lose some weight by March to help make my wedding dress alterations easier. Not much, the dress fits almost perfectly but there's a lot of dimpling in the fabric that would be eased by weight loss. 

So far, I have tried focusing on water intake, being mindful of portions, snacking etc. I think I do so much better than I used to on physical activity. I go to the gym usually every other day and I never skip more than 2 days. Even with help from the Mayo Clinic Diet since August, I've only lost 3 lbs and I canceled that diet plan because of cost.

1q2916k,Body changed but cannot explain it,"Happy new year guys!!

I have started my weight loss journey around September/October after breaking up with my ex. Changing in diet was pretty quick because I stopped eating due to being heartbroken. Since it got cheated on I assumed that my body (weight gain over the relationship) must have been the reason and I stopped eating. Eventually I tried to change at least my diet when I was eating too a lot of protein (with I’d say almost no carbs). I skip breakfast most of the times (replace it with tea or protein shake), try to eat a protein packed lunch and skip dinner or try to cook a healthy dinner. I’m definitely in a calorie deficit but I’m not sure how much (former boredom and stress eater here).

Due to my office job I don’t really walk anymore but I try to get 7-10k daily. I sometimes dance with my friends but more exercise I don’t do.

I see a change in my body also my clothes slowly start to fit more loose.However, the my weight does not change at all!! I still weight 120 kg while I feel and look way more leaner. I searched online and I read about body recomposition but I do not go to the gym for that to happen.

these meds also cause or contribute to muscle pain and spasm so it's hard to get in any sort of distance walking.  i took a couple of naproxen, though, and got out of the house.  even walking a short distance [helps](https://imgur.com/BjIhTOO) but this is still edematous for me.

so I've been back on calorie counting for about 2 weeks now. I'm a 5 foot female and started at 224 pounds. I am currently at around 202 pounds. I've been counting calories strictly and have recently started walking/jogging daily. I also cut out a lot of sugar and generally just been trying to eat a lot cleaner. I stopped eating fast food when I was eating it daily and just asking myself if its worth eating something before I eat it and have been more active as well as stopped eating because i'm bored and only eat when I'm hungry. that being said, I've been losing about a pound a day and I'm getting worried. I'm eating enough and not feeling hungry/ getting headaches feeling dizzy or anything like that. i've read that people that eat too little or lose weight too fast can have serious health problems or even die so now i'm concerned i'm losing weight too fast and that it will have longterm consequences or that I'll develop health issues. especially with my heart I'm also scared of gaining it all back although I really am trying to fix my habits. am i ok? or am i going about this wrong? i'm classified as morbidly obese and still have about 90 pounds to go. i'm sorry if this post isnt appropriate for this sub",1767382778.0,0,19,loseit,weight_loss

1q26jvp,"Disappointing NSV thread, anyone?","This might sound silly, but I thought it might be fun to document some of our more disappointing NSVs. This thought occurs to me while I was cuddling with my fuck buddy and kept having to reposition because his bony prominences were digging into me, and it hurt! Cuddling was easier 180 pounds ago when I had cushioning. 

And then of course there's much more casual sexual harassment which I mostly avoided in my twenties due to being super morbidly obese. But honestly, I'm in my late 30s now, don't give a flying fuck, and definitely better equipped to handle it than I would have been in my teens or twenties. So not entirely sure how to classify that one. 

And then there are my (former?) friends who are still obese and have distanced themselves from me. I understand on an intellectual level, but it still hurts emotionally. I swear I'm the same person.

Edit: Forgot to mention that long car rides really suck now. I used to be able to drive 14-16 hours with only stopping for gas and bathroom. Now I need a bit of a walk a couple times a day which cuts into that time. Also the car seats and seatbelts dig into bony prominences furthermore. The safety factors certainly outweigh the pain, but there is a low level of discomfort that reduces with weight gain. ",1767378795.0,90,130,loseit,weight_loss
1q25krf,How to measure proper fat loss and what was your timeline?,"Hi all, ive been going to the gym for a full year now. Lost a bunch of weight then got into a relationship and gained it all back. I was doing just exercise  for weight management and still eating like garbage.

About two and a half months ago something in me snapped. I woke up and just started to fully take control of my life. Been meal prepping consistently using stealth health making high protein meals, I started fermenting my own kefir and have completely changed my gut composition (i drink 500 ml daily). Im also taking my holistic health changes to other parts of my life.

Over the last 2 months my clothes have become looser. Pants and base layers in particular which were extremely tight before are very comfortable now. I was already doing heavy resistance training before, but I feel way more “solid” now as a whole. 

However im facing issues where the scale literally hasnt moved at all other than the initial water weight loss in week one. I tried switching to taking measurements of my body instead but they can be pretty inconsistent due to just general water retention. Has anyone had this happen to them? By the estimation of my clothes i shouldve lost atleast 10 lbs by now, and its impossible to have gained 10lbs if muscle in 2 months (I was way past the point of newbie gains). Has anyone else faced this? How did you estimate progress to keep yourself motivated?

I get what they're going for, but I legitimately think sometimes people with binge eating/any kind of addiction need to hear is the opposite of that.

2. Did some yoga stretches I found on Youtube.

3. Ate eggs and beans. 

4. Drank malta juice (our own farm grows em).

6. Evening milk tea 

7. Did cardio first then weight training (2kgs only). For half and hour.

8. Ate salad and veggies with roti for dinner. And walked for an hour after it.

1q20uo8,Weight gain after joining gym??,"Last year around this time I was about 83 kg. Over months of dieting, I slowly brought my weight down to 76 kg. That itself was a big win for me, but then I hit a plateau. My weight stayed stuck at 76 for quite a while even though I was disciplined with food. Eventually, last week, I decided to join a gym to push past the plateau.

Here’s where the confusion started.

I checked my weight just before joining the gym, and it was still 76 kg. After just a couple of gym sessions, my weight suddenly went up to 78 kg. Today morning it was 77.5 kg, and immediately after today’s workout it dropped to 77 kg. By the end of the day, it tends to climb again.

The important thing here is this, My calories and diet are exactly the same before and after joining the gym. No extra food. No cheat meals. No change in macros.

That's like ""how to become a billionaire: work harder, spend less"" 😄.

Anyway. My story: 6'0 male, normal weight around 194 lbs (88 kg). Ballooned to 275 lbs (125 kg). Started the ""right"" way. Took me FOUR YEARS to reach 185 lbs. Training twice daily - 30 km cycling, 75 min calisthenics. Always hungry. Miserable. Would not recommend.

Then COVID hit. Back to 253 lbs. Now at 218 lbs. No brutal workouts. No starvation. Just a few simple habits.

The habits:

1. No sugary drinks. Water, tea, coffee - no sugar.
2. Three meals a day. No snacks between.
3. 15-20 min walk after each meal. Indoor counts. Some slow movement — tai chi style, nothing intense.
4. One outdoor walk daily. Hour or more.
5. Around 3000 calories. Not starving. Slightly hungry, but livable.

That's it. No magic pills. No suffering. No ""rise at 5am and destroy yourself"" nonsense.

It gives me wiggle room to gain a little without approaching overweight territory. I can also lose slowly this year without having to rush. And if I manage to hit it early? I can just switch to maintenance.

I had hit 145 in November and I've been maintaining ever since, so I'm pretty confident that I can do this. Super excited!

Everything was about my ex husband's schedule, my kids' activities, keeping the house running. Now they're grown and he's gone and I'm looking at myself thinking who even is this person.

I'm not trying to get my 30 year old body back or anything delusional like that. But I want to feel strong again, like I can carry my own groceries without my arms shaking or climb stairs without getting winded. Basic stuff that I just let slide for two decades. Started using ray app a few weeks ago because my daughter set it up on my phone, I was too overwhelmed to search options. Some days I can barely do 15 minutes with it and it doesn't matter, the thing is that I’m doing it, and I want to start this new year like that, being consistent doesn’t imply being perfect.

The hardest part isn't the actual exercise, it's working out alone in my apartment and not having anyone to be accountable to. It used to be, I'd skip workouts because someone needed something, now I skip them because no one cares if I do them or not. Trying to reframe that as freedom instead of loneliness but some days are harder than others.

Edit: seems like a lot of people are in the same boat; everyone is noting it’s about how I feel. I do feel healthy and I know I have lost a lot of weight, but I sometimes look in the mirror and see the old me! Thank you all for sharing!! ",1767360587.0,37,108,loseit,weight_loss

1q1xoex,"Beans are healthy and cheap, but I hate the texture","I know beans in general are a great source of protein and fiber. Plus, they’re much cheaper than chicken, fish, etc. and better for the environment. I’d like to try putting more of them in my diet, but I really hate the texture. Chickpeas, brown beans, white beans, kidney beans: they all feel mushy and mealy in my mouth. I’ve always had issues with textures, that’s why I don’t eat mushrooms, tofu and most seafood either. Doesn’t matter how they’re prepared or how finely you cut them. The squishy structure feels horrible to me. 

I’ll admit I might be biased towards beans altogether, but I’d still to find ways to at least some legumes in my diet. For health, budget and environmental reasons. I do like green beans and broad beans, but those are not in season now and therefore more expensive, and they fly them in from Kenya to Europe (where I live). I like corn too, but from what I understand it doesn’t have the same perks. It’s actually a grain and therefore a source of carbs instead of protein and fiber, right? 

So what would you recommend? Are there other legumes worth trying? Ways to prepare them? I don’t live in Northern America, so please make it generic, no specific brands. They may not be available here.

1q1xh0w,I fail in weightloss,"I have a major weight issues. From healthy-looking and thin girl (58 kg, 164 cm) | gained about 10 kg last year. Almost everyday is a binge... So I talked with my mom and decided to go for eating window and start eating during 6 hours a day, then 4, then omad at the end of the month. But i'm not supposed to eat ALL THE 6 hours

Today I was supposed to eat within my eating window. Instead, late so much in 3 hours...

What late: - cottage cheese with yogurt

• apple - 2 carrots - yogurt with honey - chicken salad (no dressing) - 1 liter of beetroot soup - groats with vegetables and chicken - oatmeal with vanilla soy milk and honey

I'm so overstuffed I can barely move. I have time off, not going to uni or work and and instead of studying or doing productive things i ate. I hate mvself. I used to be beautiful and very attractive and i ook like crap.

Last night I watched ""motivational"" videos of overweight girls binge-eating, hoping it would discourage me... and today I did the exact same thing.

1q1xgiy,Looking for advice?,"So… SW 193lbs last spring. I’m F5’3”. I was down to 187.8 after my surgery for a stubborn infection that stuck around for about 6-8 months. Nov 10 I started calorie counting, and mid December I was cleared for running and regular exercise. I am now at 172.8lbs. I eat around 1450-1600cals per day, steps 7,500-10k, “move” average of 475kcals. I usually do some weights and run at the gym twice a week and do walking and yoga the other days.

Does this seem sustainable? Or too fast. I am pleased but thought the loss would be slower. I was aiming for a 500cal deficit but it seems to be higher than that. My first goal weight is 160, then hopefully I’ll stabilize and get down to 145-150. I’m very dense… so I know that is still high for bmi but that will be good for me. BMI has not been a great indicator for my body type. I am 172lbs and can fit into size 10 jeans… if that helps.

Anyway, is this ok that I’m losing faster than I thought? I just want to make sure I’m not accidentally overdoing the deficit… I want this to be sustainable and maintainable. Any advice appreciated….

1q1sudm,New and ready to do this! (19F),"Hi all! I (19F), after a few weeks of wishy-washy dedication to weight loss and being healthy (compared to years of more wishy-washiness), am finally ready to truly commit and hold myself responsible. This post is mostly for myself to give me a baseline, but also open to other peoples' tips and tricks. Let me know in the comments if you are of similar age want to talk as well!

I weighed myself for the first time in months today. I try to avoid doing so or looking at my weight because I feel so poorly about it every time. 5'5"", 214.1 lbs, US size L/XL. I hope to get down to 150 lbs, size M.

I have been calorie tracking on MyFitnessPal for about a week. It and TDEE say to have about 1600-1700 cal to lose weight, I've been averaging like 1400 cal between 2 meals a day. My maintenance cal is somewhere from 2100-2700 cal (crazy) so I hope I will see results at some point. I hope that diet will be the main cause behind my weight loss, as I think I'll have an easier time staying on track if my weight loss plan doesn't diverge too drastically all at once from my current lifestyle.

I am the proud owner of one YMCA membership now. I hate running, but love lifting and abs. I do stairmaster, walking, and maybe will start elliptical and swimming for more cardio. I got a 9:-- mile the other day which I was actually really proud of as someone with an 11 min average in PE class lol. I hope to do as little cardio as possible but if that's unrealistic I'll lock the fuck in and just do it lolol.

Here are my current issues and hopeful fixes:

* Binge eating/late night eating
   * I eat when bored, for fun, etc. I am a night owl and study late late LATE at night (thx college) so the aforementioned often happens at dead of night, which is not good. I hope to fix this by sleeping earlier to fast skip to the next day and not give myself opportunity to night eat (also just need to fix my sleep schedule in general).
* Genetics and comparing myself
   * I have never been skinny. Or maybe I have, but my self image is so poor that I've never been able to recognize it. I hope to fix this self-esteem issue over time by keeping a journal of what I am grateful for and what I like about myself. It's harder, though, when I have so many friends who have never had to struggle with weight. My roommate, no joke, eats a pint of Ben and Jerry's at least twice a week and has never gained weight. That's just not me, and I know we are all different, but it's so hard to see that and \*not\* compare.
* College meal plan and generally limited good food
   * I LOVE food and trying others' cultural foods. My college has really quite bad food. Low quality produce and poorly cooked/seasoned veggies make me dread eating at the dining halls. This is why I have been eating too much take out these past few months of the year, because the city my college is in just has such good, diverse foods. I will fix this, and save tons of money, by sucking it up and eating dining hall food at least once a day, and supplementing with campus eateries if I need something actually good. I will also delete my food pickup apps

I want to fix my relationship with food while ensuring that I don't develop disordered eating. My parents both started Wegovy a year or so ago and lied about how they were losing weight, saying it was just intermittent fasting. This caused me to feel super awful about why my fasting results didn't look like theirs. I don't want to use weight loss drugs until I know I \*need\* them, if that point ever comes. I want to prove to myself I can do it. It starts here!

1q1rmov,"My 'I haven't lost weight despite trying really hard, here's my life circumstances, any tips?' post. There are many like it, but this one is mine.","I spent the whole of 2025 trying to lose weight. I got a gym membership and tried to eat less and healthier (in a very basic way- less fast food, less processed snacks, more veggies and fruit). I ran into a lot of problems and ultimately ended up fatter than I started, despite my numbered weight being lower (though not by much). I went hard at the gym but burnt out on it twice. Going to the gym is very draining since the exercise is easy for me to get myself to do, but being around people in public isn't. I get to a point where I need alone time and just can't be in a public place like that for a while. I would go to the gym for a couple months and then burn out and then not go for a few weeks.

I also have a major rebellious streak even with myself. I hated controlling my diet and inevitably binged on snacks and everything I was denying myself when my willpower snapped. I'd get back on the horse, but it was a cycle and the damage was done. When I was succeeding in eating less, I'd often end up with too little energy and fall asleep in the middle of the day, and just need to eat my previous amount so my body wouldn't feel like it was gonna eat me. How do you do that calorie deficit thing and still give your body enough to function? 

I'm autistic and have that safe food thing, and I'm also trans and depressed and on estrogen and lexapro. I tried tapering off the lexapro to see if that was making me keep and gain weight, or affecting my appetite, and the mental and physical side effects from decreasing the dosage were too much for me to bear with, and I put it back up to normal.

I don't want to count calories. I don't think I have that in me. I don't want to give up all the foods I enjoy, I am not living a life devoid of tasty snacks just to become one myself. If I wanted to, idk if I could. But as much as I've also tried to just accept the body I have now, I can't seem to be happy with the size I am.

I've also heard that stress and sleep can be factors. I sleep like shit. I get enough sleep time-wise, but I have almost constant nightmares and wake up sometimes out of breath and physically pained, in addition to mentally reeling. I had a sleep study done last year and the only thing they could tell me is I don't have sleep apnea. I have a lot of anxiety, I'm traumatized, and I live in a city that's very loud and fast, and I have had a lot of stress from hearing neighbors too. Though I've considered moving, at the moment I can't really do anything about that. 

I still try, like ambiently. If I get a pizza, I get toppings like mushrooms and anchovies that I'm pretty sure are better for me than sausage. If I'm going anywhere, I walk as much of the way as I can if it's not urgent time-wise. That might induce some laughter, it's probably very negligable. I'm back at the gym, and if I know I'm gonna zone out to youtube I at least try my best to get to the gym and do it on the treadmill. I'm gonna do that after I post this.",1767336253.0,0,34,loseit,weight_loss

1q1r4eb,Committed to losing weight this year. Trying to add PPL to my exercise diet plan. Looking for some confirmation or recommendations,"I'm currently 42 y/o, 216lbs and would like to be 180lbs, or close to it. I'm starting a diet to cut calories (starting with Whole30), going to cut alcohol, and adding HIIT on a stairmaster 2x/ wk, but want to add lifting into the plan.

1q1qmoy,2025 was rough. Gained 35 lbs and now trying to reset,"Hey everyone,

I gained about 35 lbs (16 kg) over the past year. A lot of it came from stress I didn’t know how to cope with, mainly family issues. Food became my comfort, and over time it just turned into a habit. Now it feels like my brain automatically says eat, even when I’m not hungry and yeah, that part sucks.

The hardest thing isn’t the weight itself, but realizing how hard it is to break a habit I built when I was struggling. Saying “no” to food feels way harder than it used to, and I know I need a real push to get myself back to healthier routines.

This year, I want to change that. I’m not trying to rush it or be extreme.. just slowly fix my habits and work my way back to feeling healthy and comfortable in my body again.

- If anyone has tips, advice, or even just words of encouragement, I’d really appreciate it. I could use the support.

Thanks for reading, and happy new year 🥳

1q1ovh0,ADHD Weight Gain,"Right before my late in life diagnosis of ADHD I had healthily lost 15kg and had built a beautiful amount of muscle.

Starting medication, I fully expected to lose more and be even more disciplined at working out. 

Instead, I have gained a lot of weight (11-12kg). I have lost a lot of my drive to workout as I think it was fuelling my dopamine and the medication negates that need. I’ll workout sporadically nowadays but it’s no longer routine. And, since my medication is short acting, I get a large dopamine fall off late at night that gives me physical sensations of discomfort and a craving for fast carbs that won’t go away. 

I’ve experimented with a few strategies: I eat a high protein meal before my first dose, I split my second dose in two and spread them out to taper the dopamine drop, I increased my iron and electrolyte intake (making sure to take the iron + vit C far away from my medication).

On the one hand, treating my ADHD has helped me immensely, I make less mistakes, I lost all symptoms of anxiety, my logic and mentality matured, I stopped procrastination in my career, I felt more control over deciding when to do things that require mental exertion. However, I’ve begun to consider whether I can stay on this medication since this weight gain comes with new issues. (I don’t need medical advice - I’m booked in with my GP and I may return to my psychiatrist after that.)

In the meantime (waiting takes months), has anyone had experience with this? How did you incentivise yourself to reintegrate exercise? How did you stop late night eating? Or did you lean into it and allow yourself a high-carb snack before bed to take away the pain? Any advice would be appreciated. ",1767327534.0,0,6,loseit,weight_loss
1q1obiw,How do I make this fun?,"How do I make this fun for an 11 year old? 

Before the New Year my son said he wanted to make his New Years Resolution be fitness. His goal was to shrink his belly. I’m glad he was able to say this to me instead of bottling it up. He is not overweight. We just saw his doctor in December and all was well. He is at the stage of growing out and will likely grow in height sometime this year. 

I want to support him and help him feel comfortable in his own body. How am I doing this?

1. We are doing it together. I could stand to lose some weight.

2. Include him in planning: We made a list of the one junk food we would omit each month. He chose to do a 30 day challenge on top of regular exercise. I selected planks and a walking challenge. Walking was one thing he requested.

3. I planned for a type of workout that would not take very long. He has adhd and loses focus over time.

4. By not stressing him out over stuff like counting calories, regular weigh ins, and so on.

He is introverted and shy so joining sports is off the table for now. Can anyone suggest ways to make this fun for him? ",1767325881.0,2,65,loseit,weight_loss

The past two weeks I’ve been traveling and visiting family and I just feel like shit because of how far I let myself off the leash. I’ve been eating pizza, fried things, endless amounts of chips and dip, soda, etc and I just feel like I’ve completely ruined everything for myself. I haven’t had a full sugar soda in 6 months and during the holidays I would have 2-3 per day cause they were available.

I’ve gained a bit of weight over 2025 and although I eat very healthy and do work out it’s not enough due to not being in a calorie deficit. Can I just not eat? I know that sounds so stupid but people fast. It would also be easier for me to skip meals due to the fact I’ve never had strong hunger cues and I promise I’ve always been like this. Obviously, I would still eat dinner and dinner is usually my highest calorie meal. I always eat veggies, meat, carbs, etc. But say I don’t want breakfast or lunch? In fact, food lately has really been disgusting me. I’m just so over it if that makes sense. Id also like to make 2026 my year where I focus on my weight and strength. I know that eating less slows metabolism and makes it harder to loose weight but doesn’t it also force your body to loose the fat as energy? How could I eat way less but not slow down my metabolism.

1q1ka09,Not really sure where to start,"TLDR- used to be active, had a rough patch for health (still am tbh), would like to get back into shape and back into a healthier weight range. Any advice would be very helpful!

F, 20, 5’4, 150-165lbs (weight fluctuation)

Doctors haven’t mentioned weight as a problem, but I want to get ahead of it since weight issues are very common on both sides of my family (weight gain AND loss). I’ve gained 20lbs since I started college in fall 2023. At my college, we have a small YMCA gym and track as well. The college food isn’t super healthy but I’m looking into budget-friendly meals. 

I used to be really active but then I developed a half dozen or more health issues. This isn’t a New Year’s resolution lol, I just really miss being in shape and playing sports etc.

Extra context:

For starters, I have adhd and depression so forming habits is really difficult for me. I also have asthma that seems to be getting much worse as I get less active, and over the summer I had a really bad asthma attack after trying to go on a jog (I didn’t even last a half a mile). I almost went the ER, but didn’t think it was that bad until I was pretty much bedridden for 3 days after. I also have frequent ankle sprains on both sides, a shoulder/peck injury that I never went to a doctor for (too poor), and weak knees. In January 2024, I had multiple kidney surgeries and hospitalizations, ultimately leading to me developing post operative anemia (mild according to labs but felt a lot worse) and POTS symptoms (undiagnosed, so not sure if that’s the real issue).

As you can probably guess, it’s really hard to be active now. I used to enjoy volleyball, gymnastics, dance, and a few other things, but now I can’t really do any of those things. I’ve been at a point where I’m sad that I’ve lost a lot of physical ability for awhile now, but I’m officially getting to a point of being insecure about the loss of tone. It’s not even really being a little chubbier that’s getting to me, it’s the fact that all of my muscles seem to have turned into flab. 

Any advice is welcome!!!! Thank you so much :)",1767314630.0,0,3,loseit,weight_loss
1q1k7bj,Lost 200 + pounds but my mental feels flat recently,"Hey everyone. Looking to see if anyone else has experienced this. 

Over the last year I’ve lost a very large amount of weight (420 to 205). I’ve been in some form of a calorie deficit for a long time and trained pretty consistently throughout the process (running, lifting, staying active).

I’m near my goal of 200lbs. but mentally for the past 3 weeks I feel kind of flat. Not sad exactly, just low energy, muted mood, less excitement, more irritability and a lot of anxiety. The scale has also been stubborn for a couple weeks even though intake hasn’t really changed. I have a lot going on at work but it just feels like I’m blowing things out of proportion recently. 

I’m realizing I may have been under-eating relative to my activity level for a long time and I’m wondering if this is just the mental side of prolonged dieting catching up with me. 

I average about 1000-1200 calories daily. Male, 33, 5’ 10”. I been in that deep of a deficit for probably close to six months and haven’t felt like this so trying to dial in what’s causing this recent change. 

Has anyone here:
• Lost a huge amount of weight
• Struggled mentally near the end of the cut (I’m 5 pounds away from my goal but man this has been a curve ball)
• Felt better after going to true maintenance for a bit

I’m not looking for medical advice, just real experiences. Did eating more help? Did it take time? Or is this just part of the process after a long haul? 

Feel like I should be on top of the world, I fought and got my life back. but I just feel flat. 

Appreciate any insight.

1q1k1mj,Thank you to the woman who mentioned husk fiber,"
A few weeks back someone mentioned taking husk fiber to feel full. It made me think on how frustrated I was that protein on its own was not filling enough for me, at least not for long but whenever I had lentils for dinner I had no desire to eat anything afterwards. 

Ive started researching what foods I could eat that had a high fiber content and I decided I will give porridge a chance. I am from Spain and porridge isnt something that is eaten here but I knew of it. Well its been a godsend. I prepare about a batch of 3 glasses for breakfast and have 1 per day. It feels me up completely. I get to lunch time without any problems and it just keeps my cravings in check. I have now gone on a quest for gradually increasing fiber in my diet and I feel its one of the key elements that will help me heal my BED this year.

Ive gone up and down the same 10-12 kilos over the years. When I was finally getting a hold of it and lost the weight gradually after getting into muscle trainning 5 years ago I then had a terrible break up and had to go on antidep meds for a year which made me gain it all over again. 

I never had a problem with eating healthy, I love healthy food, but I am addicted to sugar and view/viewed food as a reward and a treat if I had a bad day. Classic emotional eater mindset. 

When Ive been in shape I always felt amazing, sexually attractive and was even able to enjoy sex more. Its amazing how these body issues can affect us in other spheres. On the flip side, whenever I was too close to looking as great as I could I would become afraid of success and gain the weight back. Almost as if I wasnt ready for the new me and for the fight to be over. Who would I be if I didnt have these issues? 

I feel more mature now at 35 and more equipped to deal with my hunger and my fear of success.


So to the woman who talked about husk fiber THANK YOU! That idea catapulted my research into fiber and made me better equipped to deal with my cravings.",1767314016.0,229,29,loseit,weight_loss
1q1j18c,Happy with the Holidays,"I ended December .4 lbs lower than I started it, and considering my Holiday goal was to ""gain *less than* 3 lbs,"" I feel so pleased with this. Not just because I don't feel derailed, but because I really enjoyed my Holidays and bits and bites of all the special foods I look forward to this time of year. 

I stuck to my steps and workouts as best as wonky Holiday scheduling allowed. I stuck to lots of water daily and really limited alcohol (this is fairly typical for me). And I stuck to tracking 9 days out of 10 even when things were pretty zany and the numbers were more of a guess than a track. It was actually helpful to track because I could see that my weekly average for calorie intake was only 200-300 over my typical.

But I also just ate everything with much more *enjoyment* because I did so when I wanted something. Last year I would just snag a cookie, a handful of nuts, a handful of popcorn, whenever I walked through the kitchen. This year, it felt a lot easier to have what I wanted *when I wanted it,* and not otherwise. 

Don't get me wrong, I can feel that my body is eager to get back to more regular eating, and my body is fairly desperate for a vegetable, but overall I feel so good about this. Halloween through NYE typically fills me with anxiety around food and weight and sweets, and this year everything has felt really chill, and I'm grateful!",1767311338.0,18,3,loseit,weight_loss

I walk/run 20000 steps everyday. If I’m not mistaken, that burns about 800-900 kcal. I do weightlifting for about an hour 4 times a week. 

I try to calculate my daily caloric maintenance value & it keeps giving me different results. Mifflin–St Jeor result comes around 2000 kcal, but I think that’s when I don’t do anything AT ALL during the day. How can I learn the estimated value? I plan to be on 2k calorie deficit.

1q1i8w6,Feel like I’m having an identity crisis after losing over 70lbs - can anyone relate?,"Having lost 75lbs in the last 2 years I’m feeling a bit confused about who I am and what I look like. I’m so happy with my weight loss and feel so healthy and love being able to wear new styles - but alongside also approaching 40 I just feel like I’m having a bit of an identity crisis! 

I don’t really fully understand how to dress for my new shape, I’m trying to stay somewhat true to my original sense of style as I dressed in what I felt was quite a fun unique style, but also a lot of that was designed to distract from my size which now I don’t have to do. I’ve been trying out lots of new shapes and looks in the last 6-12 months and it’s been so fun but also frustrating and confusing (especially without a huge budget!).

I’m also considering a new hair style because my hair just doesn’t feel like it fits anymore. I’ve always had super long hair and again, it was somewhat of a distraction tactic. So now I’m debating a long bob, which I’m excited to try but also it has me wondering am I just being a bit mad trying to establish this new identity?

1q1djb7,My journey and goal for 2026,"My journey and my goal for 2026

In april of 2019 I started tracking calories and going to a personal trainer, because I wanted to get rid of the weight I added on during my studies. The weight was slowly but steadily going down, I worked hard but wasn't happy in general.
Then, 2020 came. Meaning a pandemic that had me work from home fulltime (instead of biking 20 miles to work), gyms closing, grieving my grandfather who died and also getting over the end of my relationship of 3 years. This all happened in the first 4 months of 2020. I did not handle it well and in a span of 2 years, I got to my highest weight ever. 103kg's at 25yo. This was +23kg compared to my starting weight in april 2019.

I did not have the headspace to do anything about it at that time, I just became a bit more bodypositive and worked on loving myself as I am, first. Which, I absolutely do now. Véry slowly and without special efforts, my weight lowered a bit. I suppose the stress and sadness had stabilised at that point.

Late 2024, I decided to turn things around and get back into shape. I love myself, but I still want difference, for my wellbeing.
I've been tracking my calories for over a year, started going to the gym again and slowly, the weight dropped again. January to may, I lost 5kg. However, I hit a plateau and couldn't get past it. Small changes weren't enough. In november of 2025 I consulted a personal trainer again, who's now guiding me regarding calories, training, and small extra efforts that can make a difference and I am more motivated than ever. I have now lost 10kg, compared to my heighest weight during the pandemic.

For 2026, this will be my focus (as it was last year), and I wíll make sure it pays off.
By december 31 of 2026, I will have lost an additional 15kg's, so I will be 80kg's.

While I don't THINK I actually lost enough weight to tell a massive difference quite yet, I definetely feel like my skin is a little looser and not as tight. My lower stomach especially has been sagging and I can pick it up and slap it on a desk like bongos LMAO.

Since then, I've gone down to 120kg, mostly by eating less (finding healthy food here is expensive, so I've opted to spend more time without eating) and walking a lot - 10k steps most days. Admittedly, I've taken it easier over the past couple of weeks because of the holidays, but it feels like it should've still moved down a little bit, and yet it hasn't. I have been hovering between 120-121 for weeks now, and I don't know. Am I meant just to start getting a lot harsher now? Walk more and eat even less? I have been using MacroFactor to keep track of my calories and weight, and for the most part, I haven't changed too much in my habits. I have been working on a deficit of anywhere from around 400 to as much as 1000, depending on how i was feel that day. My BMR is supposedly around 1700, and with the amount of walking I do, it should be pretty well over 2000 calories of expenditure, and I rarely try to get to 2000 calories of eating. Am I just understimating what a single day of setbacks can do? Because I did eat a fair bit more than normal during christmas (although still less than I did last year by a lot). But on average my expenditure should still be working on a deficit, and in theory that should mean I'm still losing weight even if not as quickly as I was before.

hi, i just wanted to know how to lose 5 kg without counting calories or restricting too much. honestly, im pretty content with my body shape just that i feel like my thighs are huge, very difficult to find pants that fit nicely and i just dont like the way they look.

my preferred workout would probably be dancing and walking and ive been trying to eat healthier.

i also study intensely and for long hours which makes me hungry frequently, so i tried to eat fruits during my study sessions. if i cant help it aka still feel hungry to the point having brain fog and couldnt think, i would eat little bit of carbs

my biggest issue would be maintaining the 5kg loss without relapsing. usually, once i reached the goal weight, i would be too scared to eat because im scared that it would tip the scale up. so having reached the goal weight would actually make me stressed because i would not want to screw it by eating.

i would be thankful for any advice :)",1767290215.0,0,4,loseit,weight_loss
1q1a4rg,Looking for tips,"Hi! I'm new to working out and having a weight loss goal. Ive gone to my apartment gym 5 days in a row and I feel like I just don't know what I'm doing and want to know if why I'm doing will be beneficial to shredding pounds. 

First- 
I'm 31 yrs old, female
I weigh 310 lbs. I am 5'7"".

I just started zepbound. 
The last five days I've just focused on cardio- doing 1.5 miles on either the elliptical or treadmill. I've been keeping my pace somewhat moderate (3.0 average speed- no real structure to it just pumping up the speed until I feel like I can't do it anymore then dropping the speed to catch my breath and then repeating). 

I've tried to use the weight machines and free weights but feel dumb because I don't know what I'm doing so I just end up doing random sets of 10  and then doing something else. 

Should I stick to cardio to help build endurance and help me shred weight? 

I want to hire a person trainer but can't afford one just yet, so are there any apps that can be helpful with making a workout routine? 

I will appreciate any advice that can be given! ",1767289747.0,0,6,loseit,weight_loss
1q19iix,What are some lesser-known or less talked about bodily changes that come with healthy weight loss?,"Some context as to why I’m asking this: After being overweight and dealing with dysmorphia my entire life, a few years back (un 2017) I (34M) started a weight loss journey that failed during/after the pandemic. I lost around 26 kg but as of now I have already gained them back plus some more. 

The past couple of years I have been struggling so much with losing weight, because I know that if I’ve done it before I should be able to do it again… So besides the obvious (feeling more comfortable with my body, having healthier habits, and the like) to find more motivation, I am looking back at some of the bodily changes I remember noticing the first time. 

I’m talking about non obvious things (at least to me), like:
- shinier skin on my face and softer body skin
- seborrheic dermatitis much less intense
- mons pubis fat reduction
- less frequent paresthesia when sitting down
- pants/belts and other clothes not leaving marks on my body
- being able to see my “full” belly when lying down

1q18x5h,Posting my weight loss journey online taught me something unexpected,"I started posting my weight loss mostly to stay accountable, nothing serious, just meals, small wins, bad days, whatever felt real at the time

What caught me off guard wasn’t the discipline part. Calories, routines, showing up, that stuff was pretty straightforward. The hard part was explaining it. People kept asking the same questions over and over, what actually helped, what didn’t matter, how I stayed consistent, how I handled plateaus

At first I tried answering everything one by one, but then I realized I wasn’t even fully clear myself. Not every habit mattered, not every change made a difference. Posting forced me to see patterns in a way I didn’t expect, what people saved, what they kept coming back to, what they ignored completely

Most of this happened through Instagram. That’s where the questions came from and where I noticed what resonated. At some point I stopped guessing and started paying attention to signals, saves, replies, repeat questions. I even used a simple tool, Rupa Pro just to see what people actually reacted to instead of assuming I knew

The strange part is the physical work felt simpler than translating it into something useful for others. Doing the work was easier than explaining the mindset behind it

Did anyone else feel this? That losing the weight wasn’t the hardest part, but making sense of it after was. Just something I didn’t expect when I started sharing",1767286843.0,43,23,loseit,weight_loss
1q18iu8,My suggestion to all New people here.,"We all know this is when alot of new people start the weight loss journey. 

Let me first say you can do it. You need the right tools and support. You can find alot support in this group. 

First keep track of all measurements with your body.  Run to the store find a measuring tape and log it weekly by app or on paper. Hips, arms, thighs, calf, neck ect. 

Take photos, front n sides

Splurge on a good scale. 

Get a Bluetooth one with app that tracks more than basic weight.  A scale that will tell you muscle, visceral fat % ect.  

You can find ones like this on Amazon $100 and they are FSA/HSA eligible. 

Why do this? Because you may gain muscle but lose fat at the same time so your body will change shape and get smaller but a simple scale won’t reflect it. These in detail scales will tell you you gained muscle helping you stay positive and not give up. 

Gaining muscle is good. It burns more calories. 

Don’t run to the gym right away. Start simple. My suggestion is always a 100$ cheep under the desk treadmill. You can push this under your couch or where ever.  Pull it out when you’re ready to watch a show.  Dedicate small goals like “I will walk 10 minutes of every hour of TV I watch.  So if you r having a lazy afternoon watching tv pull out that treadmill and at the start of each episode walk and watch during the first 10 minutes. 

Turn off your add free tv  subscription. Get adds again.  

Why?  Think of the time the adds are playing as get up and move moments.  A advertise turns on, I get up bring dishes to the sink and begin filling up the washer, or load the clothes washer. I hear the Tv show is back on I go back to watching it.  

I have been a yo-yo dieter my entire life. Now in my 40s and I haven’t been this small since I was 12.  These small tips I received and learned from these online groups is what finally did it for me. 

These online groups can be some of your biggest supporters. If your at home family doesn’t support you and tries to enable you come here post we will back you up and tell you, you are strong enough to do this. ",1767285862.0,107,17,loseit,weight_loss
1q18at9,Is what I’m doing problematic?,"I am on Vyvanse. I work 7am-3pm. To lose weight, I’ve been fasting during the day and only eating 630-9pm. I usually don’t feel my hunger till around 5, and I will plan a meal and go shopping to get the stuff or start preparing. 

I will consume an exorbitant amount of food in that time period. Once I eat one bite I literally can’t stop and will walk to the kitchen from my room for snacks after my meal every time I run out of food. I would keep going but I usually eat some melatonin so I pass out hard around 9-930. 

I walk 5 miles a day and I drink prebiotic/probiotic drinks with a lot of fiber. I drink a lot of water during the day. My digestion seems fine. 

Is doing this bad for my health in any way? I think I’ve heard you aren’t supposed to eat before bed before.

And example of what I eat. This is pretty middle of the road for me.

Main meal:
Lean pork carnitas (630 cals), a shit ton of protein.
6 corn tortillas (240 cals)
1/2 cup feta cheese, low fat (unknown)
1/2 cup pickled onions (30 cals)
1/2 cup guacamole (unknown)


After I finish:
1 Greek yoghurt (flavored) (120 cals)
1 ice cream bar with chocolate coating(230 cals)
2 mini bags of sunchips(240 cals total)
A handful of peanuts (unknown)
2-3 standard light beer bottles (200-300 cals)
All my supplements (40 cals)
Milk and cookie (200 cals)
Whatever else I can find (~300-500 cals)

I like to pretend I’m healthy but then break down and lose all self control when I eat. Drinking makes things worse my inhibitions are noticeably lower after 2 beers. I also smoke weed, which definitely stimulates the hunger around 3. I usually have two joints a day. One around 4 and one around 9.


I’ve lost about 35 pounds last 6 months but I am aiming for about 25 more. 230-195, want 170.

1q181fb,Some cheap ingredients,"I’m 15f and I make my own breakfasts and lunches, sometimes my own dinners. Right now, we’re tight on money and I’ve been trying to find some cheap ingredients that’ll help me get more protein and that’ll last a while since I tend to have the same things for breakfast and lunch but not dinner since I don’t always get a chance to make myself dinner since I come home late from school (my mum makes it for my dad and brother, both of us have been losing weight so we either just have a little of the dinner she makes or our own meals entirely).

For context, this is what my meals look like:

Breakfast ingredients:

\*\*Tesco growers harvest soya milk - 69p\*\*

Tesco Scottish oats 1kg - £1.25 I think?

5-6 bananas - 75-80p (I use half a banana and save the rest)

\*\*Tesco zero fat natural Greek style yogurt 1kg - £1.25\*\*

Lunch (school):

\*\*cucumber - 90p I think?\*\*

Sweet potato - approx 35-40p each

Carrots 1kg - 69p

Homemade loaf of bread (idk my mum makes it to avoid UPFs so much and to save money)

If not, usually just Tesco’s medium sliced bread - 74p

Snacks:

\*\*Growers harvest mixed veg - 99p\*\*

Broccoli head - 82p

Stockwell and co cola - 49p

\*\*Rice cakes - 79p\*\*

Apples 6 - 99p

Dinner

\*\*Baked beans (specifically reduced salt and sugar, my family prefer the normal ones) - 42p\*\*

\*\*Tuna in spring water (specifically spring water, my family prefer in sunflower oil) - 65p\*\*

\*\*Stockwell and co Apple and blackcurrant squash - 45p\*\*

So the ones in \*\*this\*\* are ones that I specifically buy and nobody else really uses. Obviously I eat other stuff, but everything I mentioned here is specifically everything I buy and the stuff that mostly I use. 

I’m thinking of maybe making a few swaps to make it cheaper. I’m gonna start prepping my school sandwiches by buying the bread on reduced, pre making and freezing sandwiches, buying more tinned/frozen stuff to preserve things longer and using foods for myself for cheap (virtually free) snacks, like my mums potato peels and air fry them into crisps or just use any other fruit that’s about to go bad (not my fruit, usually my mum’s) and use them in my oats, or using my brother’s cucumber peels for extra fibre in my sandwiches.

Another thing is I’m gonna have to learn to cook better. Right now, some things that I make are carrot and tomato soups, tuna based sandwich fillings, rice with veg, lentil and veg stews, carrot fries, etc etc, but we do have some canned chickpeas and beans that I could learn to cook and to like so they’re not just sitting around I suppose. I’m not sure what I’d use them in though lol.

This also isn’t supposed to be like a pity post at all by the way, the thought just came to my head. We’re by no means poor, we’re middle class but with my dad being the only person working in our house (he’s 61 </3) and since now at the end of the year my parents are just tight on money and it’s just something to help him out I suppose.",1767284658.0,2,15,loseit,weight_loss

1q17j4n,"I’ve used homelessness as a reason to let myself go, and I’m now the highest weight I’ve been since 2021.","I’ve been semi-homeless since August 2025, hopping between staying with my former partner’s family, AirBNBs, and hotels. I’m not looking for pity or sympathy in this, I am very fortunate and safe! 

Obviously in becoming homeless, weight management was not something I was prioritizing. When I packed my car up the first time, I didn’t worry about if I had my bodyweight scale or my food scale with me. 

The thing about being homeless, and everyone you interact with knowing that you’re homeless, is everyone feeds you. From sharing home cooked meals with me to taking me to restaurants to buying me treats, the few people I’ve spent time with over these past months have all made sure I’m well fed. And I LET MYSELF BE FED, without counting a single calorie in the last four months. Even cooking for myself, I was so lax with it, I didn’t care. 

I wasn’t surprised when I found that the ONLY pair of jeans I have packed with me started feeling tight. I wasn’t surprised when they stopped fitting me entirely. 

In the spirit of the new year (cliche, I know), I decided that I need to stop letting my lack of home be an excuse to just let myself go and to not care about my health. I have access to a kitchen 90% of the time, I have my food scale, and I have to stop letting my situation be an excuse to continue letting myself go. Becoming more and more overweight will not improve my situation. 

I went out this morning and purchased a cheap bodyweight scale. I weighed in, and again I was not surprised. I’d been guessing I was sitting around 150lbs, and lo-and-behold 149.9lbs at 5’3, my highest weight since 2021. 

I’ll be turning 30 in November of this year, and as a gift to myself I want to be the healthiest version of myself that I’ve ever been. That starts now. Happy New Year! ",1767283363.0,48,14,loseit,weight_loss
1q175sx,I'm kinda ashamed of it but I've gained a lot of weight this year.,"Don't get me wrong I was already overweight and trying to lose weight (125-130kg), then I gained weight and went all the way up to roughly 140-145kg maybe even 150 for what I know. I haven't weighted myself in the last couple of months tbh. 

This year I went through a lot of stuff and I can't even believe it myself. I used to be a stable 120-130kg for years and this year went bad. 

I was trying to just walk for either 1 hour outside or go to the gym and walk for 1 hour on the treadmill. Main reason why I'm embarrassed it's because my clothes were already multiple xxxl-xxxxl but now I have to buy even bigger clothes which for some reason I feel even more embarrassed. I do see now that I breath more heavily than before for the smallest tasks and it kinda scares me. 

I feel like I need to work 3-4h a day 7x a week to lose weight but I also get some advice by different people that say that 45m to 1.5h a day of training maybe 3 to 4 times a week it's more than enough and so I'm confused now.

My Question is for those who lost a lot how long after hitting your final maintenance did your body stopped readjusting shifting things allowing you to find your true clothing size?

Why, because I find it interesting in my temporary maintenance time frame I found clothes that fit me perfectly when I hit this weight now seem a bit to big. I for real for the past 6 months just bounced up and down 1-3 lbs. Like jeans that I finally bought New from the store I can pull up and down with out unbuttoning or I find a shirt could have been one size smaller. And I am still the same weight as when I bought them.

1q16chn,I made a promise last year.,"Just a TW for a cliche vent.

-

So... 2025 ended.
I just wanted to rewatch everything that happened this last year, at least at the beginning, it was one of the worst years of my life. My parents were obsessed with one person and with constantly comparing me to her. I was already on the verge of severe depression and thinking about killing myself, I was seriously tired of being treated like the plague by other people just because of my appearance. 

After my mom said something that, actually really hurted so fucking much, I changed that day completely, like the next day I was already secretly counting calories, with just the fuel of that exact phrase she said, I promised myself that I would change, that I would make them proud, that I would be worth, never telling anyone.
I started with 180 lbs in September, and i'm now at 148. I have a lot more to lose, but i'm just very happy how I managed to change my entire mind in a few months, with just the (slightly unhealthy) motivation of ""being good enough for my parents and people not bully me anymore."" Lol

Sometimes I just look at the scale and thinks ""Is it even real?"" I got so used to being overwheight that I can't really believe I lost weight by... Doing nothing but eating less calories. I blame myself for thinking it was some complicated thing in the past, I was so scared of change, but sometimes change is the only option.

But overall, i'm happy i'm doing this, or for at least trying to! And I want to move from ""my worst year ever"" to ""the best year"" in 2026. :)",1767280267.0,3,3,loseit,weight_loss
1q15yzq,Got to BMI 21 and still fat,"Pics: https://imgur.com/a/OmPaPsN

I’ve lost 50 kg (about 110 lbs).

And even though I can absolutely see a difference, I can’t help but notice that compared to other people with similar stats, I still look much fatter.

I’m 5’6” tall and currently weigh 132 lbs. 

My goal from the very beginning was 119 lbs, so I know I’m not done yet. Still, realizing that I’m only 13 lbs away from my goal and yet there’s still so much fat on my body is honestly a bit depressing.

I’m aware of many factors.

 I know women naturally carry more body fat, I know that having been obese literally since the age of 3 means my body will never look a certain way and I know excess skin makes me look bigger than I actually am. Plus lifelong obesity affects body composition and I should be lifting weights and I’m not. Please don’t judge me... I work from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., I study, and I have mandatory college classes from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. I genuinely don’t have the physical time to go to the gym.
I know I might need to eat more protein, and I do try to do the best I can without completely exhausting myself.

I know it's not my mind playing games and the pics show it.

I did yoyo over the years, so I guess I've all the odds against me.

My question is mainly about expectations... is this a normal outcome after massive weight loss?

I don’t know... I keep wondering if this is normal, if there’s something wrong with me. I feel disappointed and a bit discouraged.
I’m open to advice. 

Edit: I can't answer anyone, but I'd like to thank everyone who took the time to answer my post.

I seriously see myself as definitely fat. All the women I see on social media or TV don't look like me. Yesterday, I saw ""Love Actually,"" and Keira Knightley looked so amazing, beautiful, and dainty, and I'm like three times her size...

I walk 15-18k everyday due to life stuff alone.

If everything goes to plan, I'll start weightlifting this summer. I plan to get my degree in July. I try to sleep when I can. I try to get some hours of sleep at work, or if I know that my professor won't care, I leave early or sleep in class... I know it's not sustainable, and I got in a car crash once due to sleep deprivation. I don't have a family, and I need to support myself on my own, but it's just for another few months.

1q15uhx,"It’s gotta be the coffee creamer, right?","Hey all!

This time last year I decided I needed a change. I (35M) started at ~215lbs 6’, I ate at a deficit and cut out most fried foods (dad of 3 so McDonald’s is inevitable every so often). I work on my feet and walk about 5 miles a day at work plus slinging the kids around while I’m home.

By the end of summer I was down to 175lbs and felt great but still had some stubborn belly fat. This holiday season I’ve gained back about 10lbs. My wife had a major surgery and I’ve been at home for the past 6 weeks being the sole care giver of everyone. 

I havent changed my diet incredibly, a little more snacking throughout the day. The one thing that has increased immensely is the amount of coffee I drink and the subsequent creamer. I looked at the label today for the first time and was shocked to see it’s 35cal per serving (which I am easily doubling every cup I drink) and comprised greatly of oil.

I know I have an issue with coffee, I am also a recovering alcoholic so it’s the only thing I got.

1q15mtf,Meal frequency & food noise. What works for you?,"TLDR; What meal frequency/diet gives you the least food noise? And for context if you don’t mind; what is your gender, age, activity level? 

25F, sedentary a lot but average 6/7k steps most months and aiming for more this year. I strength train when I’m not travelling but I travel for long periods of time a lot so it tends to be 3 months on 3 months off lol. Planning to travel less this year so will be more consistent (I enjoy weights, not so much cardio but I do want to work on that this year too) 

I have my weight mostly under control but I feel like I’m going between periods of binging, gaining weight, followed by under eating (not consciously but my life tends to get busy in waves and lo and behold…) and I know it’s a bad habit. It’s not ED levels or obsessive; it’s more habit and the fact I less a relatively unstructured life and travel a lot - but I is definitely a cycle I’ve been in for years at some level.

This year I really want structure around my eating but not sure how I should go about it.

I eat mostly whole foods, rarely eat out, lots of dairy and eggs but that’s because I tend to overeat these things. Sometimes I ponder veganism just to remove the temptation but I love my greek yoghurt lol

So: my diet is high in Wholefoods, fibre, protein, veg. But I still always feel very anxious about food; hoarding it, daily grocery shopping, eating alone, fasting most of the day but grazing in the evening… 

Would love to hear works for you in terms of dampening food noise!

I’m one of those people that gets hungrier if I eat breakfast, and so my first meal is late in the day- but wondering if this is a temporary thing? Could eating 3-4meals a day lessen the food noise or is it better to eat less times a day bc you don’t have to consider your meals multiple times? Is it more of a macronutrient/fibre/overall.

I’ve also heard intermittent fasting tends to work better in men than in women but don’t think there’s hard science behind it.

1q154xc,new year new me!,"hello there, I'm a long-time lurker here and I just wanted to write an appreciation post for this subreddit since it has been my main source of motivation! :D

thank you so much for being such a great and level-headed community! finding loseit really made me feel like I'm a part of a whole new movement of getting fit and healthy :)

I found answers to many questions that are usually too trivial to find easily in search engines

overall I had one goal in mind this year and I'm proud to say that I've achieved it:

I've lost 72 flipping lbs !! that's like a whole 10 year old child or something

all thanks to CICO and daily cardio/walking :)

will be looking forward to getting into weightlifting this year!

I've also posted my progress on progresspics if you're curious

  
by the way it would be epic if you'd share your own progress and goals for 2026 under this post!

1q14klj,What to do about leftovers?,"Last year I didn’t have this problem of constant leftovers filling my fridge because I had 4 brothers who gladly scarfed down everything I didn’t finish like garbage disposals. However, now that I’ve moved out I still am not able to finish my meals and end up storing them in my fridge. I feel this guilt for throwing it away but also feel guilty when I force myself to eat it and accidentally binge eat. I have tried offering it to others but like…who wants a strangers leftover?

1q11gcs,"The league of extraordinary goalsetters: week 1. New year, New goals","Welcome to the League of Extraordinary Goal Setters! The idea of this weekly thread is to write down goals, and break them up into 7 day chunks by figuring out what specific part of the goal you’re working on during the week.

Obviously, if you’re here, one of the goals is probably to lose weight. Whether that’s 2 or 200 pounds, it’s not going to be accomplished by doing one single thing today. However, losing weight is absolutely the product of a million small changes replicates over time— the small things we do each day add up to big changes over time. So, let’s start breaking it on down! 

Let’s kick this off by writing down our goals for 2026, and then pick one or two things to work on THIS WEEK. 

Remember, all threads live and die by comments, so please jump in and support your fellow League members! 

The point is to set goals that you can work on THIS WEEK. “Lose 50 pounds” is a great goal, but what are you going to do in the next seven days to support that? Meal plan 7 days in a row? Log calories? Try out how skipping breakfast/intermittent fasting goes? 

There is of course always an urge to overhaul everything at once; that often ends in failure (check out this podcast episode for more on that: Episode 47 – Comin’ In Hot – We Only Look Thin LLC )

I’ll go first with this weeks prompt: setting initial goals 

As someone who has been around for a while, I am stating with some goals that I know are in reach for me. 

2026 goals 
Log 100 days at a calorie deficit between now and April 30th (120 days): THIS WEEK,  I am aiming for a goal of 1600-1800 calories. I haven’t been eating at a deficit recently, and I want to ease into it. Not sure how to start with counting calories? Check out the quick start guide: https://reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/quick_start_guide 



Run a 30 minute 5k in November (turkey trot): not starting on this yet


Participate in r/52weeksofbaking: baking cinnamon rolls today! 


Read 4 books (currently reading Food Politics by Marion Nestle.): this week I will read 50 pages. 


Bike to work minimum of 3 times a week (have only one shift left this week; plan to bike, have a good biking streak already going) 


Host this thread weekly: posted!

1q0ztoq,tips on how to get over scale anxiety?,"i really want to me healthy this year. the main thing holding me back is that any time i think about getting a scale and weighing myself, i get right on the edge of a panic attack. i've tried other methods of tracking progress before (mainly measuring my waist and thighs, which is where i hold most of my fat), but its not really something i can log anywhere but my notes app. also, i can't be scared of the scale forever. usually i'd just wait until i have a doctors appointment since they'd weigh me anyway, but i don't have any scheduled in the near future. 

i know i just need to get on the scale and all the times after it won't be this difficult, but does anyone have tips on how to get over this mental hurdle?",1767257639.0,0,16,loseit,weight_loss
1q0zci4,Is a 100 calorie deficit enough to loose weight?,"Hi, I’m a 160 cm female who weighs 58kg atm. I want to try and reach 55 kg.

At the moment, my maintenance calories are supposed to be 1595.

I know people say to eat in a 500 calorie deficit but I find it rlly difficult. At the moment I’m in between certain things so I’m at home most of the time.

I generally walk around 10-13k steps a day, with a 30 minute, 5000 step walking workout from Grow with Jo.

But I find myself eating around 1600 calories or a little more around 1700. This mostly happens on days when I go out, but on a normal day I normally eat around that range.

I’m also not able to eat meat or fish so I just find myself eating whatever my family gives me just in a restricted manner.

I’m not sure whether I should join the gym to loose weight, or try more of a deficit since the calories I count are generally overestimated.

I just find it really hard to loose these last 3 kilos and would really appreciate any advice.

Edit: thank you everyone for the help! Sorry I didn’t respond to everyone but I did read everyone’s advice and it was rlly eye opening!

I’ve been a bit sick lately so I haven’t been able to be as good with my weight loss, but I did go down 0.4 kilos in the last week so I guess I just had to be patient!

Thank you everyone, I hope it keeps going well.",1767255688.0,0,28,loseit,weight_loss

1q0y3uj,[Challenge] European Accountability Challenge: 1st January 2026,"Hi team Euro accountability, I hope you’re all well!

For anyone new who wants to join today, this is a daily post where you can track your goals, keep yourself accountable, get support, and have a chat with friendly people at times that are convenient for European time zones. Check-in daily, weekly, or whatever works best for you. It’s never the wrong time to join! Anyone and everyone is welcome! Tell us about yourself and let's continue supporting each other.

For all new people that have joined this month, at the start of the month we do a roundup of what happened. We'll also talk about our goals for January.

**How was your last month?**

You're free to structure this however you want, but think about the following topics:

- How has your weight loss progressed? Better, or worse than expected?
- What are some Non Scale Victories that you've experienced this month?
- Did you set goals, did you keep to them?
- What went well during last month, what could need improvement?
- What important lessons did you learn?

**Today is also the goal-setting day for the coming month!!**

If you're new, every first day of the month we think about small goals we want to achieve this month. They can be weight goals, exercise goals, or anything really... An important aspect is that they are SMART goals: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time based...

- Do you have a goal weight for this month, if yes, what is it? For example: maintain a 0.5kg loss a week.
- Do you have exercise goals? For instance, get in 10.000k steps a day
- What plans do you have for your diet? Do you have goals there?
- What are some non-weight/exercise-related goals you have? Here, get creative. Past participants have used this section to stay accountable for their homework, learning languages, pledging not to order junk food, ...

1q0xmdo,I wanna finally lose weight and get healthy,"Hi, I'm a 25 year old who wants to lose weight for 2026 but isn't sure where to start. I use to go to the gym but it wasn't for me.

As a teenager, I began struggling with weight-related problems due to the challenges of growing up in an unstable household and being subjected to bullying, which led to unhealthy eating habits and significant weight gain.

I had limited knowledge about good nutrition growing up, and as a result, my parents often prepared deep-fried junk food, contributing to my weight gain. My desire to be healthier stems from concerns about my health and the desire to stop my family's hurtful name-calling.

If anyone has some good tips for meal preps or workouts I can do that help alot thank you.",1767248923.0,9,7,loseit,weight_loss
1q0wz7j,I went over 300lbs today for the first time,"I've always told myself that no matter what, at the very least I would do whatever I could to stay under 300 everytime I got close it was the motivation to lose again, usually about 30lbs or so. Then it comes back. It's usually always accomplished by counting calories, really tracking my food, until I get sick and tired of doing so. I haven't been tracking for months and I shouldn't be surprised.

Today I weighed in at 301.4 So I know this time I don't think that's going to cut it. I've been yoyo dieting, doing CICO, since I was 12 always just hoping this time I'd stick with it. I'm always quick to give advice and feel like I know the answers (rip) but I've never made a post quite like this...please, give it to me! I need to hear what y'all got to say even if I've heard it before, but this time I have to think about myself and just do it.

1q0w04p,How big of a difference does losing that last 30 pounds make?,"Bit of a weird question, but I'm curious for those who lost a lot of weight, what difference did it make mentally and physically to lose that final 30 pounds?

For reference, I'm a 31(M), 5'11, and about 18 months ago I was 305 pounds.  I lost 85 pounds over the first \~12 months, but have basically been stuck at around 215-220 for the last 6 months now.  Part of me is really happy with the progress I've already made.  220 is already the lowest weight I've been as an adult(Previously low was 230 like 5 years ago), and on top of that, going to the gym and lifting weights has become a legitimate part of my every day routine now. So I've also definitely built a foundation of muscle that I've never had before.

  
But, I think I've found the motivation I need to truly lock in on the dieting in particular to put together another 12-16 weeks of dedicated cutting and get down to the 185 range that I think would be my ideal weight. I currently sit at 213 pounds today so another 28 to go. 

One of my 2026 goals is to be able to try and run an 8 minute mile and that's a big motivator to lose the last 15% that I feel I need to lose.

  
But I'd like to hear from others that maybe experienced similar?  What was the feeling like when you finally lost that last bit of weight you were looking to lose, did it feel particularly rewarding and did others start to really notice it as well?

1q0rdsn,This year will be different!,"This January 1st is going to be different. It have decided that it will have to be. I’m out of excuses and I’m out of time.   
  
When it comes to plans, i was a perfectionisht. When things didn’t go  to plan, I ended up quitting altogether. So  I making this time. This time, I’m not trying to lose 100 lbs, or 40 lbs, or even 15 lbs. I’m focused on building new habits, because that’s something I can control. I’m going to eat at or below maintenance every day. I don’t need to lose some crazy amount of weight right now, I just need to stop gaining. At the same time, I’m committing to cycling near the block at least once a day, for more than 45 minutes. I just need to keep my mobility. Once that’s solid, I can do more. The path I’m on has to change.

Nothing I’ve tried before has stuck. I crossed a pretty... bad weight milestone sometime this fall, and the last few months have felt like giving up entirely. Too much Doordashing, too many days built around delivery, too many stretches where my entire world shrank to bed, couch, and pantry. That ends now. I’m done with extreme days, no more massive calorie blowouts and no more barely moving at all. I know I have so much to live for, and the way I’ve been living lately isn’t really living.

I’ve had so many plans live quietly in my head and then disappear without ever turning into action. Putting this here is my way of choosing accountability over avoidance. Even writing it makes it feel more real. I’m hoping this is the start of a better year, and if you’ve been through something similar, I’d really appreciate hearing what helped you",1767227217.0,77,17,loseit,weight_loss

1q0pej0,Can't Lose weight and Struggling with ADHD,"I (27 m) have always struggled with weight. I was a chubby kid who grew into a fat adult. I ate food in order to feel loved and happy. I was always aware of the constant weight I was gaining but I always treated it as something I would eventually figure out in the future. But now I'm nearly 300lbs and I'm so tired of it all. In the past I kept a strict diet and stayed in a calorie deficit and worked out often. I barely saw the scale move 10 lbs over the course of 8 months. My body actively wants to stay fat even though I hate it with every fiber of my being. I looked into GLP1's but I can't afford them unfortunately. I just feel extremely distraught and I'm sure the comments of this will just tear into me about creating a structure and keeping up routines, meanwhile I have ADHD which literally wants to destroy all forms of healthy routines, but this is more a rant than anything else.

1q0ozit,Is 1500-1800 cal daily good?,"Just recently started dieting about a week and a half ago. Figured what’s the point of waiting till New Year was eating way too little the first week but upped it when I learned it was supposed to be eating more. I’ve been having a fairly wide variety of foods: meats, veggies, fruits, cheese. Hit the gym every day, walk 5 min, run 1 min, then 5 min again and so on for about an hr. Then I lift till failure on a few machines. Just curious if this is a good calorie mark or if I should be upping it even more.

1q0oq0t,i gave away most of my clothing last week...,"...because i'm determined not to go back. i've got 30 more pounds to go and i've shrunk out of almost all my clothes. there's a local buy-nothing group in my neighborhood. i am a size 18 right now, and most of my clothing was size 24 or greater. the vast majority was between sizes 28-32 and everything was in great shape. 

setting up to post my clothes was an adventure - so many memories! i had to go through every piece of clothing i owned. that was actually kinda cool because a lot of them brought back special moments - the first onesie i wore at the regional burning man, the evening gown that i found when we went to a performance of ""ode to joy"" one new year's eve. i was a little sad about that gown and the llama onesie in particular. i still haven't decided what to do with my wedding gown. 

i washed everything, sorted it, then safety-pinned a tag to each one, with the size and anything special about it. there were around a hundred when i was through. i made three posts: <=3x, 4x, and >=5x, and listed each item as a comment. 

i really enjoyed giving them away - i was happy to get rid of stuff and the recipients were glad to have the clothes. i was really lucky because toward the end, someone rebuilding her wardrobe asked if she could have all the 5x and 6x that was left. not everything was claimed but my sister works in a transitional housing facility and took the leftovers.

i'm serious about not going back. i will continue logging food and weighing myself every few days to catch problems before they get bad. it was not easy to lose this much weight and i'm not going to fuck it up.

1q0n3nb,For those who had a shocking scale-weight increase: an anecdote!,"I get so demoralized over the holidays when I see my scale weight increase that I am tempted to continue overeating.

This year I decided to examine it and see what happens if I immediately get back on the plan:

* December 24th SW = NORMAL in the morning. Dinner of the Seven Fishes party in the evening. I partied.
* December 25th ALL the treats plus eggnog. We're talking proper binge. I logged but did not count.
* December 26th SW = +6 POUNDS. Lunch at pizza restaurant with former colleagues --I enjoyed but did not binge.
* December 27th SW = the same +6 pounds.
* December 28th SW = +5 pounds.  I am fully back on my normal diet.
* December 29th SW = +4 pounds.  Still feeling fat but sticking to the plan.
* December 30th SW = +1 pound !!!  B-day lunch for friend, ate very conservatively.  Peed like a race horse all day!
* December 31st SW = -1pound!!!! I feel normal and the 1 pound weight loss puts me right on track.

It didn't even take a week.  If you're a bingey person like me, it can be really difficult to see that buffed up scale weight and not start to spiral.
I made a concerted effort this year to not give in --I enjoyed my holiday and jumped right back into my diet plan --even with remaining social obligations.  I am so pleased I did.

I went from 181 to 159 and I’m super proud of myself. honestly, I’ve been overweight most of my life and it’s always something I’ve wanted to fix but I never had the motivation to do so. I finally decided enough was enough and I joined this sub to look for guidance on what my first step was. I started going on a calorie deficit and tracking what I ate on myfitnesspal and it has helped immensely. there is always room for improvement and I do need to work on balancing my meals better but wow it really puts things into perspective. 

my next goal is to start working out now that I’ve lost a bit of weight. I still want to stay in a calorie deficit but I also want to gain muscle which I know also takes time but it’s also something I’ve always wanted to do and never had the right motivation. does anyone know any easy exercises to do at home? I know walking is a popular method but I also thought maybe swimming could be good since there’s a pool at my place. I’m not sure it’s the right weather though so I might wait till it’s warmer for that. I also heard that eating more protein helps you gain muscle better. is that true?

1q0lqzv,Need to start over in 2026-- lost myself,"Hey everyone! I'm looking to jump back on the weight loss for 2026 (probably like a million others). I have a fairly healthy history of successfully losing weight but regaining it again. This time around, I'd like to lose the weight and keep it off. Here are some things I do already:

1. I calorie count (or am familiar with it)
2. I'm vegetarian
3. I participate in high activity exercise (I'm a runner)
4. I drink plenty of water (roughly 72-128 oz a day)

I'm 29, 5'8, 155.2 lbs (70.5 kg) and hoping to lose another 15 pounds (about 6.8 kg).

1q0ll1b,Tracking calories,"Thinking on taking a break from tracking calories, I didn’t track at all for the bulk of my weight loss, first 5 months or so. Hit a plateau around 200lbs and started tracking everything, which worked. I was able to drop another 15lbs fairly quickly, and am continuing to lose. Now I’m sitting at 175-178 and I’m thinking on stepping back from the daily calorie tracking. At first it gave me a sense of control, but after a few months it’s starting to feel tired, I feel like I’m limited in what I can eat because i try to track the calories as accurately as possible. 

Ive recently added in a more lifting, and a lot more cardio into my routine, so I’m thinking to see better numbers in those areas, I’m going to cut back on the deficit a bit. Would like to lose an additional 15lbs, but I’m willing to do it over a longer period of time now.

1q0l3ov,500 calorie deficit + 1 hour of daily cardio machine vs 1000 calorie deficit and no cardio machine ...,"Hello,

What is the difference between a 500-calorie deficit plus one hour of daily cardio versus a 1,000-calorie deficit with no cardio?

Most programs and trainers recommend a 500-calorie deficit combined with daily cardio. While calorie burn from cardio varies based on weight, intensity, and equipment, it seems like you would end up close to a 1,000-calorie total deficit either way.

I get the 1 hour cardio benefits for hearth health, but I just do 30 mins of regular pace walking for that or get 10,000 steps a day

The primary concerns with a 1,000-calorie food deficit are muscle loss and nutrient deficiencies. However, I am eating high protein (1g per lb of body weight) and performing two 30 min full-body workouts per week to minimize muscle loss. Emphasizing maintaining my strenght vs overall long volume. I also take vitamins to fill in any nutritional gaps.

The data on metabolism crash and the probablitiy on people sticking to 500 defecit and 1000 defecit are mixed as well.

My TDEE is 2,500, but I generally eat around 1,500 calories. This consists of high-protein lean meats, high-fiber/low-calorie vegetables, protein shakes, and a small serving of oatmeal and berries before bed.

Overall- The routine I have been doing has been the easiest 20lbs I have lost so far wihtout the daily treadmill grind. 30lbs more to go. I am a bit surprised that the general fitness industry is still pushing the cardio/pilates/yoga requitement for weight loss.   ",1767208760.0,55,42,loseit,weight_loss
1q0kc6z,Is it possible to lose weight after going thru an eating disorder?,"At the beginning of this year, I struggled with anorexia and bulimia. I was forced into recovery, and it has now been about 11 months. During this time, I gained around 50 kg possibly more, since I stopped weighing myself because it makes me feel really sad.

I know that parts of my thinking are still disordered deep down, but I would never go through an eating disorder again. One of the main reasons is that it simply doesn’t work. I always gain back every single kilogram, so it’s not worth destroying myself for something that never lasts. Because of that, relapsing is not a concern for me.

I told myself that in 2026 I would start losing weight again, but this time in a healthy way. I’m okay with taking the time it needs and stopping once I reach a healthy weight, which for me is around 63 kg. I’m completely fine with that goal.

The problem is that I don’t know how to start. I don’t know if it can actually work, and there are zero eating‑disorder‑informed professionals around me. That’s incredibly frustrating, because I don’t fully understand my eating disorder, and no one in my life understands it either please help

I know a lot of people will be using the new year to get back into diets, developing new habits, and being more active. As someone who frequents multiple planet fitness locations I just want to say:

I will not judge you.

I won't judge you if you're out of shape. I won't judge you if you don't know how to use a machine. I won't judge you if you have really short workouts. I won't judge you if you ask for help.

However, since I'm very petty, here are a list of people I do judge at the gym:

* People who have loud conversations with others or on the phone right next to me while working out. If I can hear you from across the gym, that's a problem as well. 
* People who workout in khakis. Throw a pair of gym shorts in your car/bag. You won't regret it! You don't want to be in a situation where you feel like your clothes are stopping you from working out.
* People who don't use headphones. This is unforgivable. 
* People who wear winter hats while working out. 
* People who grunt ultra loudly while lifting or slam their weights. (Remember, I work out at Planet Fitness. We're all just trying to get our workouts in)
* People who don't wipe down their machines. Doesn't matter if you think you didn't sweat all over it. Just wipe it down.

1q0gcjd,"Reached my GW days before 2026, after losing 40kg in 5 months - super long post with my thoughts about the journey","**THE WEIGHT LOSS JOURNEY**

I had been putting on weight slowly over some time – in retrospect, if I had walked 10k steps every day, I probably hadn’t put on much. But it had finally gotten to the point where my health stared to be at risk – I was in my 30s, 185cm (6ft), 124kg (273lbs) – and I decided to be the patient stereotype my doctor friends talk about – “fucks up their health before 30s, tries to salvage it after 30s”.

So at the end of summer (had to be after fruit season, you will take my sweet cherries from my cold dead, bloated fat hands) I decided to start weight loss. I spent the last week of July doing research and planning, and starting August I got at it. My plan was in broad strokes simple –1500 calories a day (averaging over a week, trying to be between 1300 and 1700 each day), at least 10k steps a day (with plans to increase physical activity later). Goal weight – 84kg, and I did not try to plan when that would be, just track by weighing every morning.

As you can see from the title, I have been successful – poetic for that to happen days before new year! After 5 full months, I have lost whooping 40kg, a third of my body weight. My fat distribution pretty much feels like all the rest is in my chest and belly, while face and neck look kinda gaunt – I am hoping that redistributes a bit.

**This is going to be a long post with thoughts about the whole thing – reading this subreddit really helped me and I hope I can help someone too. However, I also won’t hide my more negative thoughts toward the end so this might not be 100% positive and motivating. **I also will refrain from being too authoritative, you should do your own research and not use me as a source.**

---

**THE MAIN ADVICE**

Especially for someone looking to start losing weight, if you take away one thing from my entire post it’s that calorie counting is the most valuable tool you have for managing your weight loss. 

It helps you with understanding the nutritional value of different ingredients and foods, it allows you to calculate your TDEE and choose your deficit in an informed way, and it’s a means of feeling secure that you are not secretly overeating while you are still developing your improved intuition for food and dietary habits.

And frankly, talking to people both IRL and online, it sometimes feels like tech support – where people say they totally restarted their PC (they didn’t) and now can you finally move on to telling them what buttons to press to fix their issue. If you go seeking help with weight loss but think counting calories is a waste of time, a hassle or even anxiety inducing so you’ll just sidestep around it and find the right “hacks”, while there is a small chance it might work for you (and even smaller chance that it works long-term), the only one losing out is you. 

**So get one of the apps, and count every bit of food and drink that goes into your body. That knowledge and process will help you.** Even if you have some health issue that affects your metabolism, it doesn’t create extra fat out of thin air, it can only make your body use less calories or store them slightly easier – all that you’ll be able to observe as you track. Look up common blind-spots where people miscount, I noted some down in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1pvxruk/weight_loss_stall/nvzyujv/).

---

**THE DATA**

[Here is the summary of my data from the past 5 months.](https://i.imgur.com/HIbxQUJ.png)

“Average cals in” is me tracking my food. “Average cals out” is how much my tracking app says I spent from existing and walking + me tracking what	my exercise machines say (they lie). “Average deficit” is the difference between the two. “Lost calories” is a calculation based on the change in my weight that month and assuming 7700 calories in 1kg of body fat. “Practical average deficit” is what my deficit looked like in practice based on lost calories. “Deficit difference” is the difference between my theoretical and my calculated deficit. “Calculated TDEE” is the sum of my calories in and practical average deficit. 

Some interesting observations:

* First month my “real” lost calories were way higher than my theoretical. This is almost certainly due to water weight, and if you plug in there like 2kg of water, the numbers even out. 
* The difference between real and theoretical rises pretty quickly. Part of that is likely my body getting used to the same physical activities, part of it is that mid-September I got an exercise bike and that mfer overestimates calories spent by a lot. You can actually see as in December the difference shrinks a bit – that’s me primarily switching to an elliptical which not only actually causes me to spend more calories (judging by CO2 breathed out), but shows like 2/3rds of what the bike does.
* My deficit is definitely very high, and I still go on weeklong plateaus. If your deficit is much smaller, don’t get discouraged by the scale not moving for prolonged periods. Gather data and wait.
* I feel pretty comfortable saying that my TDEE currently is ~3000. Honestly, as much as I disrespect online calculators… while showing a bit higher, they are pretty much right there if I select their version of heavy/intense exercise. Frankly, ~15k steps and 30min cardio on elliptical does not feel like heavy exercise, but maybe I have warped perception. **Either way, it is still like 10-20% less than what my app shows – don’t trust calories out on your apps to be accurate. Track your intake and do the math.** It can be tempting to go by generous estimates of online calculators or exercise machines, but don’t trust them, especially if your deficit is small because that difference can make it disappear completely.

---

**THE DIET**

I won’t go into super big details because my fundamental belief is that you need to count calories and then design a diet that works for you. Also I have ARFID so I basically commit food crimes every day as far as the average person is concerned. 

My main outline was to eat the necessary macro and micro nutrients and then be flexible from there, primarily still focusing on low calorie, high volume food. I have always preferred eating a lot but infrequently – pretty much what people call OMAD. One big meal a day, then just mostly fruit, vegetables and other snacks. Probably because I have always had an issue with hunger – I am pretty much always a bit, like at least 4/10, hungry and the only thing that makes it go away is the feeling of being full. On the bright side, I am thankful it also works the other way around where I hardly ever get more hungry than that. There have been hectic days in my life where I eat essentially nothing for like a day or two and my hunger barely increases. It’s more or less just a constant hum no matter what – food noise if you will. The only thing that does make me REALLY hungry is eating a bit – that makes my brain go “okay I like that, give more!” so I can’t really eat anything “just a little” – has to be enough for me to not want more. Even when I ate badly in the past I was aware of this and preferred to do big snacking every couple of days.

I was still worried hunger might get worse if I dieted long-term, so my plan was 1) Meeting nutritional needs, 2) High volume of food, I probably ate like ~1.5kg of food daily average; 3) More protein than necessary nutritionally, 4) More fiber. That all put together should stave off hunger as much as possible. At the end of the day, I do have all the calories I need on my body, so any actual hunger is not related to needing them, but nutritional needs and psychological (side not - having a snack to look forward to really helps with mental cravings). 

Notably, I did have to read research publications, because even when my goals were “more protein and fiber”, the protein and fiber people on the internet recommend are crazy and the average numbers thrown around are super high. For protein at least there is an argument that people recommend levels for strength training and high-end fitness (maybe without realizing they’ve picked up those numbers from that community), but it’s to a cultish level at times. 

Macro-wise I ultimately settled on aiming for 100-120g of protein (recommended is ~0.8g per kg of healthy body weight for sedentary, but I’m physically active so I double that), 35g of fat (sadly necessary for certain body functions, I kept it at lower end of recommended 20-35% of total calories and frankly often didn’t meet it, probably my biggest nutritional risk), 35g of fiber (good to have but I didn’t fuss over reaching it every day). Any remaining calories went to food diversity and fruit/vegetables.

Hero of snacks is homemade ice cream. ~150 calories per pint and most of those calories are protein and fiber? Fantastic. Truly an achievement of human ingenuity in engineering and chemistry. This is what really inspires and motivates me – we are an intelligent species with incredible technological achievements, going to other planets and stuff. I don’t want to hear how actually to be healthy you have to return to subsistence farming diet lifestyle – food science should work on making more enjoyable food that has little to no calories. Sadly here in Europe I don’t get access to those keto breads that are like 140cals per 100g. Bread is great but so carb calorie dense – if someone can point me to a way to make that low cal kind at home, hit me up.

---

**THE EXERCISE**

I started off with a goal of 10k steps a day (haven't missed a day since) and for the first three months averaged 12k. I had always been someone who liked walking to places so it wasn’t really an issue – I started first day and never felt any difficulty. It only got easier as I got good footwear and learned to set a quick pace – walking is basically constantly falling but catching yourself in style, and if you do it slowly you just smash your feet into the ground, while gliding reduces that impact, while still using more calories and getting you places more quickly.

Last two months I’ve been averaging 15k a day, mostly because walkpad + standing desk makes it so easy, plus at a nice incline that isn’t uncomfortable but does use more calories.

About 1.5months in I got an exercise bike, which was nice and I enjoyed using it, but even from day one I knew it overestimated calories spent (if I use it now which is rare, I halve the number to track). Now I have an elliptical and I like it much more, the calories spent it shows is also much more reasonable. Either way, I do cardio on a machine once a day for 30-40min on upper-middle intensity settings. Doing it while watching an episode of a show or something.

Why not strength training? Because I want to put my body on autopilot. Walking at standing desk I can check my emails and do other basic work stuff. Cardio I can watch stuff. From looking into strength training it is much more about varied short routines and incremental adding of weight. I don’t want to think about what I am doing, I want to check back in with my body 30min+ later and take back control. If someone can recommend me strength training regimen that is maybe less effective but where doing the same shit for 30mins is not a problem, hit me up.

Also, ultimately while I knew exercise would push my deficit higher, a big part of my choices was to up my physical activity for health sake even if it didn’t contribute to weight loss.

**THE SHOPPING SPREE**

Being financially stable (not rich, but just able to buy stuff beyond daily necessities) really helped me. I am not sure I’d have made it through these 5 months as easily otherwise – or it might have taken me more time. Or I might have failed. It sucks to say that but I have to admit that spending money really helped me lose weight. So here is a tier list of shit I bought and focus on maybe more unusal things:

S Tier: **Standing desk + Walkpad combo** (each one separately is like B tier, but together they are an absolutely insane investment, I can get my steps so easily no matter the weather).

A Tier: **Ninja Creami** (I hate being a walking ad for them and I hope in the future they get some competition but right now it’s the only ice cream maker with that specific tech which is not commercial grade), **big Air fryer** (small ones are good for heating things up, bet if you want to cook in them, you gotta put things in one layer so big ones are super useful; I also have a glass one with a pan inside which is good for stuff that has more moisture), **Elliptical trainer** (I didn’t actually buy this, got a hand-me-down, but I will buy a new one once this breaks, I like it), **good Walking shoes** (it really does make a difference to get ones designed for a lot of walking – it can sound stupid, like obviously all shoes are for walking and surely any sportswear should be good, but man I am not going back). 

B Tier: **Exercise bike** (helped me in early months, but elliptical feels superior), **Scales** (kitchen and body, nothing exciting but gotta have them), **Multicooker** (air fryer fries, this thing boils – very convenient combo; only in B tier cuz I fricked up and bought one without pressure cooking option unlike my previous one), **CO2 meter** (making sure my room is well ventilated noticeably contributes to how easy it is to exercise at home). 

C Tier: **George Foreman Grill** (nice that the fat drips off, but honestly at least the one I got is not hot enough to make stuff better than an air fryer does), **Popcorn maker** (I thought popcorn would be low calorie enough for the volume to be a good snack, but ice cream completely replaced that).

D Tier: **Weighted vest** (waste of money, even when I did the research and knew it wouldn’t make me use that much more calories, but it’s uncomfortable and I rather just walk faster)

Honorable mention for just being able to experiment with food. Due to my ARFID I struggle to eat a lot of stuff, and being able to get quality ingredients and discard food that didn’t work out really let me expend my diet to be more healthy, not just drop weight.

Old shoes that aren’t really street-worthy anymore are great for exercising – pushing them to the point of falling apart.

Also, no I don’t have a stove or oven. Didn’t even have a fridge for a while as I bought stuff I needed for the day on my daily walks – but glad I did get one with a large freezer to facilitate my homemade ice cream addiction.

**THE HARD CONCLUSIONS**

**Read this section at your own risk** – if you are struggling with weight loss, maybe not the best idea.

When I look back at what made it easier to lose weight, it’s not encouraging. I would not be able to get my steps in so easily (either at my standing desk or when it’s convenient during the day) if I didn’t have my flexible work from home. In general, so much time is wasted when you work on site – even if I commuted on foot to get steps. As I said above – having money to buy useful stuff helps. Not being stressed helps to focus on things other than just wanting to relax and not think about my day, and it’s nice to sleep as much as your body wants not having to set your alarm to early hours. 

Year ago I moved to a new apartment with no roommates – the control over my environment is so useful, let alone when I remember how it was living at my parents (not because my family was bad, but it’s so hard when you can’t adjust your environment to your needs). Living in a walkable city helps. Living near a farmers market helps. 

Could I have lost this weight if most if not all of these factors weren’t in my favor? Theoretically yeah – calories in, calories out and all that. Realistically? Probably not. I am now in healthy weight mostly due to the circumstances of my life getting to a good point. Not to even mention that I don’t have chronic health issues, I am relatively tall and as such use more calories (though I’ll die earlier than shorter people I guess), I am AMAB, etc. – all factors that further make losing weight and keeping it down easier. 

I am thankful for all that. Not to say I didn’t put in the time and effort, but the point is that time and effort is not a limitless resource – and if the demand is too high, the supply is hard to find.

---

**THE FUTURE**

One of the most interesting things for me was that when I started my weight loss, I expected some changes to happen. Obviously I am way thinner now visually, but there are a lot of other changes people experience as they lose weight. And well… nothing. I still feel the same, mentally and physically. I like the same temperature, I feel able to do the same things physically (granted, I almost certainly lost muscle), more physical activity didn’t improve my mental health (If anything, as described before I did my best to make my exercise not make me depressed due to taking up time I could do anything else), I still prefer the same temperatures, etc. I guess when I sleep, it’s annoying to have bony knees rub together? That’s literally the main thing I notice.

What would I have done differently? Last two weeks or so actually got rough (a bit of fatigue and mentally draining). If not for the enticing idea of wrapping up right before new years, I would have stopped to go on maintenance. My advice would be – if you go with a crazy deficit (which you shouldn’t), don’t go for target weight within healthy BMI. Go for a temporary goal weight above that, and for a limited amount of time, stopping if you feel fatigued or dizzy. 

So what now? Time for maintenance, yay! Looking forward to introducing back some higher calorie foods into my diet for variety sake. And just being able to eat a lot more fruit without it making hard to reach my minimum macros. I plan to keep up my physical activity level at least for now as it’s pretty routine now. Maybe once some time passes I’ll try strength training or at least running, but that’s for future me to decide. I expect to regain some weight due to rebuilding muscle, but I will keep tracking calories and stay at maintenance which I will adjust as necessary. If I feel like another round of weight loss is needed, maybe next fall (and less aggressively) – but upper end of my healthy BMI is about where I want to be.

1q0g67j,NSV: Being kind to myself,"I’ve been committed to losing weight since August, and have lost 40lbs so far. I was losing at a steady 2lbs per week until November, where life got outrageously busy between birthdays, weddings, a funeral, the holidays, family and friends visiting, and travel away from home. Out of the 2 months, there have been 21 days where I haven’t had strict control of my diet, whether it was being away from home, having people stay with us, attending events, etc. Since then I’ve “only” lost 9 lbs, basically halving my usual progress. This is where I would normally spiral and feel like a failure for my progress slowing, but I reframed it in my head and decided to be proud of myself that I was was even able to continue to lose through it all! Even if it wasn’t as much as I wanted or planned on. I even gave myself free range a few of those days. Anyway, this is a journey and not a race, and a simple reframe can do a lot for mental health!

1q0fkcd,A trick I’m using to visualize results since it’s hard to tell looking in the mirror,"I’m on round 2 of losing weight after gaining a lot back. Because on my second round I remember how frustrated I felt the first time feeling I couldn’t see results until I was significantly smaller than before. Because of that, I thought of a way that will make it more obvious to me, even if I can’t see it.

I took a dress shirt that I used to wear regularly for work. I stopped wearing it because it was becoming very tight on me I I was genuinely worried about something embarrassing happening while I was at work. I put it on as a reference when I first decided I needed to lose weight again and wrote down in my note app exactly what it looked and felt like.

The shirt was so tight around my stomach and I also felt like I couldn’t hardly move my arms without fear of ripping. When I sat down you could see my stomach in between the buttons because they were stretched so far. 

Today I tried it again and found that it was still tight but I had full use of my arms. When I sat down you could no longer see my stomach. That felt great because I know I’ve lost weight but I don’t see it in the mirror and it really show how far I’ve come in a short time.

I think this is a great way to track progress if you have smaller clothes you used to fit into. Definitely not something that should be done daily but depending on how quickly you lose weight, maybe as short of intervals as every couple weeks to as much as once a month. Another option could be at milestone weights. Like every 5-10 pounds you try it again. 

I don’t know if this makes sense for everyone but I think it will be helpful for me as I try to lose 2 shirt sizes. What other tricks do yall use to help realize your weight loss when you can’t tell by just looking at yourself?",1767194779.0,16,7,loseit,weight_loss

But now, my body has gotten so used to it. I will have every intention to stop night time eating but as soon as a brush my teeth and lay down it’s like a trigger and I’ll get up in the middle of the night, find my snacks (chocolate or fruit snacks) and basically unconsciously eat it.

1q0c7yk,I want to finally try to do something about my weight in 2026.,"I was thinking to try finally do something about my weight by cutting out at least my everyday junk food consumption. I am decently active, at work and on the way home I average 10 - 12k steps, though work has been slow over the past weeks during the holidays, so I’ve been sitting more and just chilling.

My issue is fast food. It’s kind of what kept me going, knowing that after work I’d be able to eat a big pizza or juicy burgers in large amounts and wash it down with some Coke. Those things, along with nolifing PC games, were kind of my only source of happiness in life, so I’m getting scared about what to replace them with once they’re gone. I feel like crazy cravings for some kind of dose of food eventually going to mess me up. Been trying to go to museums and expos, exploring new country/town about things that genuinely interest me very much. While it was an enjoyable experience, I was never able to relax and enjoy the moment. It always felt tense, like people were staring at me and judging me, and I had this constant feeling of being unsafe and stressed out. I feel this 24/7 whenever I’m out of the house, and I’m just never able to relax.

Apart from being lazy and unmotivated, I also suffer from mental health issues, so there have been a lot of “why bother, life sucks anyway and isn’t worth living” moments that stopped me a lot. I’m taking meds now, so I feel somewhat better than before.

I made a post here before, and now I’ve finally settled into an apartment and don’t live in a middle-of-nowhere hostel anymore, so places are much easier to reach. If everything goes well, maybe I’ll try to look up a gym and a trainer. Right now there’s still too much anxiety to try new one on one things,  I need to regain some confidence and adapt to a new country first.

Since I was hard cutting + cardio maxxing through this entire period, recovery was poor and almost no noticeable muscle noobie gains from strength training, except the fact that some muscles like the biceps and calves are a bit more firm. Overall I have a skeletal build right now. Body fat is 15-16% as per Navy method, but it could be an incorrect estimate.

1q0arz9,Gained 2 lbs over Christmas. It's not going away and it's messing with me.,"18F, currently 135-136 lbs, was previously 134-133 lbs. Have been on a slow fat loss journey for the past several weeks. I've been heavier before and lost it, and I understand how weight loss works and about water retention and all that sorta stuff.

I just need to vent for a moment ig. I was weighing in at around 133-134 lbs before Christmas, which was a little heavier than I was hoping for (had started a caloric deficit a couple weeks prior, had seen steady but very slow weightloss), but understandable because I had started taking creatine when I started my caloric deficit. So I think the onset of water weight from that kinda stalled things.

Christmas comes around and I have like 2-3 days where I eat off plan. The only day I went all-out and just ate whatever I wanted was Christmas day (the other 2-ish I was mostly on-track with some snacking and things sprinkled in), and its not like I binge ate or anything like that either.

Ever since Christmas (despite getting back on track immediately) my weight has been 135-136 and its messing with me. It's only 2 lbs, but I can *see* the difference. My face looks super puffy, my muscle definition is worse, and I've just felt puffy and bloated. The fact that my face looks so terrible is really really messing with me. Also, pretty sure it would have been impossible for me to have been in a caloric surplus of 7000 during those couple days, so by the laws of thermodynamics I *can't* have gained this in straight fat, but if it's water retention *why* hasn't it gone back down??????

I'm just very aggravated. My family is making ""Christmas candy"" (peppermint bark and stuff) today and I don't even want to be near the stuff. All the sugar on Christmas just made me feel sick, and I've still not managed to recover from it *apparently*. ",1767180114.0,0,7,loseit,weight_loss
1q0anaf,Lost Weight but I still look the same,"I started my weight loss journey at the beginning of October this year, weighing 100 kg at a height of 5 feet 9 inches. I live in Nigeria, where most of our staple meals are heavily carb-based things like rice, swallow, garri, yam, and pasta, so completely cutting out carbs wasn’t realistic or sustainable for me. Instead, I focused on reducing my portion sizes and being more mindful of how much I was eating, rather than changing my diet drastically or following any extreme plan.

Alongside this, I committed to walking 12,000 steps every single day. No fancy workouts, just consistent daily walking. I stuck to this routine steadily, and over time the scale started to move. As of now, I weigh 84 kg, which means I’ve lost about 16 kg in a relatively short period just by controlling portions and staying active.

However, despite this significant drop in weight, I honestly haven’t noticed much physical difference when I look at myself. My clothes don’t feel dramatically looser, and when I look in the mirror, the change isn’t as obvious as I expected it to be after losing this much weight. It’s a bit confusing and even discouraging at times, especially when the numbers suggest progress but my eyes don’t seem to agree.

I’m starting to wonder if this is something other people have experienced; losing a substantial amount of weight but not immediately seeing it physically. Could it be body recomposition, fat distribution, or just the fact that gradual changes are harder to notice when you see yourself every day? I’d really like to know if others have gone through this phase during their weight loss journey and what helped them eventually notice and feel the difference.",1767179629.0,1,9,loseit,weight_loss
1q0a43t,People should be more honest when people around them are gaining significant weight,"Im a 23/M/6ft dude whos still on his weightloss journey and completely lost myself to eating pizzas and other junk food for about 2 years. 

I am somewhat resentful of the people around me because of this. Not because its their responsibility to monitor my weight of course but because nobody cared to ask if I was going okay because I was very obviously self destructing quickly. 

I think this comes from people thinking its rude to comment on peoples weight or general condition, which it usually would be if it was a random person. But when I got up to 130kg I was very clearly not taking care of myself due to depression, meeting my friends with matted hair and unwashed clothes it was really obvious what was happening to me. Bare in mind I didnt have the usual support structures as I dont have family or anything like that to take that role.

The only reason I managed to break out of this cycle during this time was because of a new person I met online and eventually met IRL, they gave me a serious reality check for what was happening to me that nobody else was willing to offer. Without this wakeup call I would of probably kept gaining weight. Never counted the calories at the time but Id wager 3000-4000 calories a day.

This really put into perspective how people treat me, non of my friends are bad people of course but its almost frightening that people arent willing to help me out if I desperately needed it.

Im still on my weightloss journey. Im about 13kg away from my goal weight of 85kg and go to the gym about 3-5 times a week along with trying to get 11k steps in a day if possible.

1q09wn8,I’m putting the scale away.,"I’ve managed to lose 60ish lbs since Dec 2024. But as per usual (not my first time losing significant weight), as soon as I hit 299lbs, I do the following: either self sabotage, let off the gas and more lenient on my diet, or just straight up fall on my face figuratively. There is something magical about not seeing “3XX” on the scale, but I think I am subconsciously reacting to the lower number in a negative way. I have been sitting at 299-302 for about 3 months.

With that said, two days ago, I told my wife to hide the bathroom scale. I weight every morning. I feel like I am going through withdrawal. I will bring it back on 2/1/26.

1q09b45,Breaking up with the scale,"I tried weighing once a month, I’ve tried Happy Scale, I’ve tried getting on the scale with a little affirmation that I’m more than just a number… It’s not working. It’s not the scale, it’s me. 

When I was in high school a lot of my friends were wrestlers. I ran cross country, and ran decently well. Nothing spectacular but 7 minute miles for 3 miles. It was slightly better than average for my area. But I remember the wrestlers obsessing about weight. At 5’2” and 135 I felt like a whale once the boys in my grade kept mentioning their weight classes. Like, dang… John is a foot taller than me and spitting in a bottle to wrestle in the 135 division. 

If I had to pinpoint where the scale became the enemy I’d say right about then. 

In my 30s and I tried a few strategies with the scale but the scale is louder than any progress I make physically and I’m tired of it. 

I did so so so much this year. And I couldn’t enjoy it as much as I should’ve been able to because I had a little voice in my head telling me “who cares that I did a half marathon, I’m still obese! Who cares I’ve done 3 triathlons. I’m still 40 pounds from goal weight.” 

Then came the injury and some weight regain. 

But I’m healthy again. Cleared to exercise. In a better head space to track calories. With a plan to increase my whole foods intake. And look at that, it’s New Year’s resolution time. 

So I’m breaking up with the scale. At least until 2027. I’m still determined to lose it, but my clothes, my race times, and my energy levels are going to be how I measure my progress on this health journey. 

Besides writing this out to shout into the void my aim is to hold myself accountable. Goals/promises seem so much easier to keep when I tell someone about it. Second, maybe you’re seeing a bit of yourself in this post - and maybe this is your sign from the universe / friendly reminder that your worth is not defined by a number on a scale. Third, if anyone has any other metric for weight loss that doesn’t include measurements (scale or tape measure) that I can be on the lookout for, I’d appreciate it.

1q079r5,In need of an opinion,"So for starters I just had a baby 9 months ago (25 F). I didn’t blow up really while I was pregnant mostly nobody knew I was pregnant. I ended up having to get induced and laying in bed getting pumped with fluid did make me gain about 30 pounds. After the hospital I weighed 155 and I was okay with that my stomach didn’t go down completely yet. I was on maternity leave for about 4 or 5 months. I ended up gaining the weight right back. ( I am breastfeeding currently which makes you extremely hungry) 

So now I am doing a calorie deficit I’ve been doing it for about 2 weeks now I’ve lost 3 pounds so far and I extremely happy about that. But I changed how much I am eating and how much I am eating. 

I have a protein shake in the morning, I usually eat a bag of pop chips for a snack and then I have dinner. I usually have about 800 calories left or a little less than that (1800 goal) 

Is this safe to do, do you think that I will lose a good amount of weight by April if I keep this up? ",1767166804.0,1,4,loseit,weight_loss

1q06kda,"New dad looking to get back in shape, any advice?","Hey there. Im 38M with a 7mo daughter.

 I was in decent shape and exercising before my wife was pregnant but she had a lot of scary complications that began very early in the pregnancy and the stress, terror, hospital visits and lack of sleep had me drop off all my exercising.

Im happy to say my daughter and wife are now both happy and healthy. 

Of course then it was dealing with a new born and the constant work and sleep deprivation that comes with it.

We're starting to come out of the trenches and our daughter actually lets us get a full night (ish) of sleep most of the time now.

Ive gained weight in the last year and a bit since this all started and a lot of the muscle I had is pudge now

Im hoping to start exercising again and trying to lose weight in the next few weeks but I need some advice.

I only have the mornings to exercise. 6am to 4pm is commuting and work time. My evenings are helping my wife and spending some time with my daughter then sleep. 

If I get up at 4:30am I have roughly 45 min to exercise before I need to shower and get ready for work. 

I own a chin up bar, medicine ball, adjustable weights and have a good paved trail in the park behind my condo.

What should I do to prioritize weight loss and fitness? What should I prioritize eating and not eating? What is a good use of this small window of time?

Im no stranger to fitness but ive never had to focus on losing weight before. Im 6' with a broad build have usually been 200lb to 215lb in my adult life with a good amount of muscle and plenty of cardio. I'm now a bit over 230lb and don't want to just turn it into muscle, I want to slim down too.

Im not in awful shape but I feel like im sliding down a slippery slope of getting towards middle age and just getting bigger and in worse shape and it being even harder to turn it around later. 

Im starting to have kids a bit late in life and I want to set a good example of a healthy lifestyle as well being in my daughter's life for as long and as actively as I can. 

Appreciate any advice and help 💙

1q069m0,How to do Calorie Cycling and Calorie Deficits a the same time?,"*Hello, just started losing weight and wanted to start calorie cycling. I currently have been using a calorie deficit with my Fitbit, which automatically tells me how many more calories per day I have to eat based on how many calories I burn + eat. It has been really helpful doing the calorie deficit of 1000 cals a day, but I think It would be better to stagger it with calorie cycling. All the calculators I found online just give me how many calories I should eat per day for that, but I would like the flexibility of having a rest day whenever I want, so a calorie deficit would be preferred. I specifically want to know if it is wise to do a calories deficit of 1500 one day and 500 the next so that it all evens out or something in that same vein. Has anyone else had experience with this?*

*edit: also if I do this should I weigh myself every morning?*

1q05dbi,Day 2..? Ish idk,"I'm (32F, 5') not restarting I'm prioritizing my health. 

So earlier this year I went from 213lbs - 185lbs ( 96kg to 84kg) which is a loss of 28lbs (12kg). 

Unfortunately my mental health took a dive over the last few months, since August, and then all the Xmas treats that now I'm up to 215lbs (97.5kg). While not the highest I've been definitely higher than I wanted to end the year. 

So now I am getting back to this but trying not to focus now on weight loss and more on healthy habits so it can be a longterm lifestyle not a short term diet. 

This is my second day of hitting the following:
-100g protein
-24oz water
-1 cup green tea
-8K steps
-vitamins
-workout. 

Did I track my food - yes
Did I have more calories than maintenance- yes
Do I know that won't help - also yes
Did I hit my goals today to be healthy- YES! 

Not 100% certain why I'm posting. Probably for accountability and a reminder I've done it before I can do it again. ",1767160202.0,7,9,loseit,weight_loss

I moved on to 1400 and began losing weight again. Today, though, it stopped working. By not working I mean I am just stuck on the same weight for days even if I am eating in my calorie count.

Truth be told, I began with an even lower calorie intake than 1200 and didn’t lose weight. Is this just how my body works? I am still overweight but I can’t eat more than 1200kcal. I’m already full even before reaching my calorie goal so I usually eat sweets to reach them but sometimes I just go to sleep and not reach my calorie intake.

Will this go on until I reach my goal weight? I don’t think I can handle a hundred more calories to eat, ngl.",1767156339.0,0,10,loseit,weight_loss

Then I start thinking about finances and recovery time and it feels easier just to stay fat. Does looking at the loose skin fill me with some pride? Yes it does but it also sucks looking at bat wings when I can flex and see defined muscle. It feels like all this work is for nothing because I’m still weighed down by my previous mistakes.

Right now I’m 5’5 1/2 at around 140-145 lbs currently in a deficit to cut to 130 lbs. My issue is I’m not sure if I should try to cut further (to 120) to lose stomach fat.

Even at my lowest weight though (125) I still had a larger stomach but the rest of my body was very thin and I honestly looked ill.

At that time though I was not going to the gym (I lost weight due to traveling), and I’m unsure if now that I do workout I will look differently. Does anyone have any advice for me?

I need to do some winter shopping since I moved to a colder area but also don't want to waste money on a bunch of clothes (including expensive coats) that might end up not fitting by the time next season rolls around. I've lost fat and gained muscle throughout my life but I've generally stuck around an XL for most things upper body.

I'm curious if anyone could speak to experience on this issue?

1q017fb,Best Ways to break stubborn plateaus?,"33M. I started dieting and exercising about a year ago. I wasn't super overweight at the time but had about 30lbs i wanted to lose. I lost around 20lbs fairly quickly while also gaining muscle from working out. I would say I'm in fairly good shape now but I definitely don't have great genetics for fitness.

I have about 5-10lbs (just ballparking I have no idea really) that I want to lose that has always been super stubborn. I've had about the same level of fitness i'm at now a few times in my life and getting beyond this point always feels impossible. I would say that I'm slightly skinny fat. My legs and arms are pretty toned and have very little fat. My stomach and chest is a bit flabby though. You wouldn't notice it when I have my shirt on, but its just a few stubborn lbs that I can never seem to lose. 

My current routine/diet:  
  
Exercise: Gym 4-5 times per week. I don't go super hard. \~45 mins each time. Usually do chest and arms. Legs once per week. My goal is not to get jacked, I'm really just trying to lose this last few lbs and I'd be perfectly happy with my fitness. I also run 2-3 times per week, usually 3 miles, and i walk on a walking pad at 3MPH for on average 45 mins per day.   
  
Diet: I have probably been eating 1600-1800 calories per day for close to a year. Obviously I have some cheat days, but I think i have been more or less at a deficit for a very long time. It doesn't seem to matter beyond this point though? I don't think my fitness has really improved at all in about 3 months. I've just plateaued where I'm at... 

I've heard that going off of your diet for a few weeks can help? I'm not really sure what to try at this point. I could try adding more protein. I'm probably eating about 70-80g per day and my weight is 160lb so this is apparently not enough. To eat more I would probably need to add calories though.

Just looking for any suggestions from anyone who has dealt with similar issues. Thanks. ",1767147886.0,0,13,loseit,weight_loss
1q00ti0,Calorie deficit is difficult,"Calorie deficit is difficult for a petite person with a huge appetite like me.

Please be nice, but I'm wondering how can I lose more weight or at least inches on my stomach within these few weeks of not being able to go for my Muay Thai class.

I'm a F, 27 yrs, 155 (5 ft 1in), 48 (106 lbs), 19.98 (approx.20) BMI. My waist is at a 68 (26.8 in) and I would like to drop it further down to at least a 65 to get an hourglass shape (which ik I can!!)

I generally eat healthy, just that I tend to overeat to my normal intake. But to eat less than 1k cals per day is so difficult sometimes 😂  (edit: based on those calorie calcs)

I've been suggested weight training, does this mean if I gain more muscles from my arms and back which is smthg I would like to focus on, along with high protein (low fats? low cards except on Muay Thai days which I go twice or once a week depending on my work schedule), would that essentially help with my metabolic rate and losing weight fast? I generally have slow metabolic rate, used to be obese when I was in secondary/college.

What do you think? Or am I just overthinking and just being sensitive and irrational. My weighing scale is broken.

Edit: For clarification, don't just assume, please use your brain and ask thank you. I'm just looking for general advice. I mentioned having a huge appetite is that on certain days I do tend to eat above 1.5k cals (up to 2), however calorie deficit calcs mentioned eating below 1.2k even just 1k cals, so here I am seeking advice.

1q00nb6,new user - calories burned calculation??,"Hi all, 

I’m on my second day with Lose It and I really like it so far, it’s the first app that hasn’t made me feel super guilty about food and makes me feel like my goals are attainable. 

However, I’m a little confused about how it includes calories burned into its calculation. Yesterday, I worked out and my total approximate calories burned during those workouts was 435, but it calculated my “calorie burn bonus” at 604. Today, my total approximate calories burned during my workouts was 372, but my “calories burn bonus” is at 179. 

Can anyone explain this? I know it’s all estimates and whatnot, but I’m a little confused on how I’m over my calorie goal for today but I ate more yesterday and my workouts should’ve balanced it out (at least in my brain, but I’ll admit I’m not very good at understanding all of this).

1pzzl1k,1 Month Gym Progress Still Motivated But Confused about Weight loss.,"For context im 6ft 95kg right now, trying to shred around 25kg, This past month i've been going to the gym doing chest/back - legs - tris/bis/arms whatever - then into shoulders also try to get atleast 5k steps in a day usually get around the 8k mark also in a relatively strict deficit getting around 140g of protein a day, whilst trying to eat over my deficit but i am not seeing the the scales go down, i haven't and won't lose motivation.  
  
What i've educated myself so far on is that when you first start lifting, your muscles will retain more water and also ofcourse become a little larger therefor offsetting the weight that you've lost, not only if someone could confirm this that would be great, also any other i guess tips, idk i just want to get shredded.

1pzzid1,Wanting to get fitter as a teen (TEENAGER),"Im 15m .Last time I weighed was about a month or so ago so may have increased or decreased (more likely increased ) i i was 12 stone 8 lb , which is think is 180 lb 

Last time i was measured in ft i was 5'7 (i was measured in hospital more recently but forgot it since its in metres ) think i may be 5'8 now . 

Im epileptic,  so i can't go out walking by myself , I can get a friend to go out with me , but hes not very consistent.  My mum can walk with me , but 
work etc again changes chances of consistency.  Im gonan be doing litter picking (doing DofE if you dont know what it is its an award here in the uk for doing certain thing for a set period of time and then an expedition ) once a week . 

But due to my limitations im already working out at home , like when I wait for stuff to warm in the microwave I do stretches , walk around . Every other day I do weights , my dad taught me weight exercises for each muscle to be able to carry the bags for DofE , im doing leg exercises to build strength in them . Im trying to get my parents to go back to a set monthly food menu since its makes food more likely healthy , since they'll make the shopping lists each time we go shopping set to that set menu , but due to my epilepsy,  my appointments and that my seizures are sporadic (idk if thats the right word since they are slighlty more often than the word endeavours to point but probably isn't really right ) , but its probably still possible to make a slighlty more set menu , I havnt really tried hard , I just mildly said about it in a conversation saying about what we eat at home .

Also need to reduce my choclate significantly again,  christmas hasn't helped at all,  im gonan go cold turkey on the unplanned choclate , ill have my yogurt that has little choclate bits in that was to replace my random choclate and my choclate bar(really small one ) in my packed lunch which I only have in because we're using them till they run out then just putting small cheese strings in . So decrease my sugar , decrease my obvious unneeded calories , since stated in the subreddit that teens shouldn't try for a calorie deficit due to still growing .

1pzyy0s,Been sick for a month,"Just looking for some quick advice, I've (F19) been sick for wellover a month now (i think i had a cold, then my flu vaccine and im pretty sure i have some sort of chest infection rn). 

Given that i haven't been able to do any exercise except my weekly pilates class however I am stillk in a deficit and walking 10k + steps a day. The lack of gym routine is also definitely starting to effect my mental health.

Has anyone had a similar situation, i seem to be getting sick back to back lately, would it br better for me to maintain until i feel better?",1767141742.0,0,6,loseit,weight_loss
1pzxvr7,A family member occasionally comments on my weight and I react every time but say nothing. Should I? (Rant),"Pretty much what the title says, I’m not overweight so it bums me out even more because of that. I have weighted a few kilos more the past year and a family member always makes at least one comment every time I visit. It’s not like directly calling me fat, just slightly highlighting my changed composition. They never directly told me to lose weight until Xmas eve but also in a kinda veiled fashion. “Oh u look like a statuesque despite me telling you you should lose some weight”. Like I own a mirror… I don’t want to be called plump-but-beautiful or any equivalents. They know I know I’ve gained weight. They know I’m interested in losing it for my own sake. But the small comments don’t feel so small when I think about them quite often. I even don’t enjoy thinking of my goal weight self because I’ll get a comment about looking “better”. Don’t know if that makes sense. In a twisted way it’s demotivating. However they support me throughout my life regardless, like it’s just this thing… They recently lost some weight due to a service job where they move a lot. Before this I’d never called them anything despite them mentioning dissatisfaction with themselves at that point. Like am I crazy? It’s more common in our culture to tell these things but I don’t think anyone enjoys it. “…if those still fit you”, or “yeah you’re plump in a good way” (as I’m heading out to run a 5k), etc. I can tell they’re trying to be kinda delicate but they also said stuff like “hey if you get beyond a point in your weight I’ll let u know trust me” years ago and now that this weight gain has happened I’m kinda just going “who asked”??! Sorry for the rant, I’m just bugged by this. I haven’t felt attractive for a couple years now (not due to the comments, I don’t live with the person), and in a weird way it’s making it worse. I was never ever considered “plump”, whatever that means. How do u talk about these things? Especially people from cultures where people are more direct like this.

1pzwq56,Trying to get back in to weightloss. Struggling a little. Advice?,"So back in 2020 I weighted just under 20 stone. I think i was around 284lbs. 

I had a moment where my youngest daughter wanted to play a game outside and I was to tired and she cried and I said to myself I want to lose weight. 

I started doing OMAD and counting calories and tried to find something they worked and I found just doing OMAD and also watching what I eat but not using an app for counting calories worked. 

I got myself down to just above 12 stone. Around 170lbs. I was so happy. I wasn’t where I wanted to be body wise but I got my weight down. 

Over the past couple of months. I’ve let myself go. Drinking fizzy drinks, eating late at night & getting takeaways. 

I’ve tried to get back in to my diet but I struggle to keep it going and obviously with this I’ve put weight back on. Not a lot. But still. Noticeable. 

I want 2026 to be the year I get myself down to my target weight. 

If you dropped out your diet or struggle. How did you get yourself back in? Is it a case of keep going? 

Any advice would be awesome.

1pzw8e5,Appreciation post,"I found this subreddit early this year when I had to absorb some hard truths after my annual physical. Obese, bad cholesterol, headed towards liver problems. I don't post a lot but I have benefited so much from the level-headed advice from you all. Thanks to this subreddit:

I'm spending the days before New Year going on long walks instead of freaking out about not counting my calories every day

I've been having a few drinks but maybe half the amount I would have a year ago

I'm planning to have a great lavish dinner on NYE and then not kick myself and feel guilty, or say ""screw it, nothing matters"" and keep bingeing. I'll just resume calmly counting my calories on January 1, and being active. One night doesn't undo my progress, and that's been hard to learn.

According to the app, I am on track for my goal in the spring of 2026. The first goal I set was conservative, so I'll be setting a new one (middle of the range, instead of just out of Overweight category, ha ha!) and focusing more on building muscle than the scale.

1pztpfz,Christmas Break Reality Check,"Hey all,

I wondered if I might be able to reach out for some moral support and encouragement!

I’ve had a really successful year weight loss wise, I’ve been really consistent with tracking and exercising and I’ve lose a good amount of weight with just about 10lbs to go until my goal weight. 

December was a slow month loss wise, which is to be expected now I’m closer to my goal and I haven’t been super stressed. I’ve changed my whole lifestyle in the past year and that’s something to be proud of.

However over the past week I decided to give myself a vacation from tracking and my usual deficit because it’s Christmas and I love eating and seeing my friends and family and celebrating.

Now I know in my brain that this isn’t true but I have this overwhelming feeling that I’m going to step on the scale in the next few days and I will have put all the weight back on and won’t be able to get back on track and have ruined my life. 

I wondered if I could just ask for some reassurance that getting back on track will be easy and that everyone else has also indulged and isn’t stressing out?

I've been dreading looking at it because I knew my weight would be on it. Well I decided I'm tired of hiding from the truth and this is very important. I never wanted to melt away and disappear like today. I'm (f) 29 and currently 271 pounds! I've never weighed this much ever in my life. I used to be 156 3 or 4 years ago. I had a lot happen the last 2 years. My boyfriend was diagnosed with cancer, my father passed away, and I had to leave my toxic job. I guess I truly let everything get to me. I worked out less and ate whatever I wanted started drinking a lot of red and white wine. I'm starting to feel the weight. I'm always tired, my body aches, I'm low energy, and very depressed. Mind you when I was smaller I was still unhappy due to me trying to maintain my weight in unhealthy ways like food restrictions borderline ED behavior. I need to change, I want to shed this weight I want to run again like I used to. I miss how much energy I had now I just can't even get out of bed. The positive is now I know how much I weigh and that was the biggest wake up call I needed to take my health seriously. I don't even care about being ""thin"" I want to be healthy, I want to have children, I don't want to always my weight to hold me back. I now have gymn anxiety and I never did in the past but  my body looks... not great in my eyes.

1pzsim6,losing weight fast then rebuilding vs. losing sustainably,"5'4"" 20y female. SW 224lbs, GW 120, currently 218.

I’ve received mixed opinions about losing 100 lbs quickly versus taking a more sustainable approach. Some people say that it’s better to lose the weight as fast as possible to get it off, then focus on maintenance and building long-term habits. Others believe it’s better to lose weight slowly to avoid regaining it.

I’m not new to weight loss, but it’s been a while. I know that I can lose weight quickly, but I also know I can gain it back just as fast. I’m currently in university, and I’m able to stick to a routine that includes working out and eating in a calorie deficit.

I am going to the gym 4 times a week doing cardio and weights and eating 1600 calories. I’m not weighing myself because when I was weighing myself I stopped enjoying the process but I know I’m losing weight because my clothes fit better, I can feel muscles and my tummy fat has changed a lot. I estimate around 20-30 lbs so far. I have gone from some e with a lot of pain and mooching around the house to being very active. I have no doubt I am going to lose a significant amount of weight 

I’m finding the process a bit mentally challenging. I’m going to the gym so much and the process feels a bit lonely. I can’t really speak to my sister or anyone about it cos no one gets it.

My wrists and fingers as well. My legs are slightly smaller, as I did drop from a size 14 to a 10 in pants in the past 1.5 months. My stomach? Doesn’t seem to be a huge change. Granted I am SO happy my face is a lot thinner, but I’m so disappointed that my stomach seems to be the last thing to go. I know we can’t spot reduce, but I wish we could!

in terms of how I lost it I was in a calorie deficit, my main meal was two beef briskets with Romanian salad and fat free ranch (Kraft) that was the only thing I ate every single day, and I did 1 hour walk of cardio 

When I started reaching 240 for the first time, I started hitting the gym, that is when my plateau started 

I’m in the gym 6 days a week for about 2 hours, first hour is the workout, second hour is cardio, I do about 1 hour and 30 minutes of cardio, so I’m just lost as to why I’ve been stuck at 240, I’ve been obsessed with reaching my goal which is 180-175lbs but being stuck has been the absolute worst and it’s killing my confidence, maybe I need to change what I eat? Maybe the beef briskets are to high in calories and I need to find something else. 

any advice, literally anything, be as brutal if need be. I’m turning to Reddit because I want to reach my goal by any means necessary, do I need even more cardio? More gym? How far do I push it? Anything at all id appreciate any advice 

To add more context when I was loosing the weight I was loosing about 4 to 6 pounds per week, I found my calories to loose 2 pounds per week and subtracted that by 200 which is how I was able to loose that much in a week.

I kept hearing about metabolic resets and was told to eat normally for a while, but now I’m back up to 235. Im not over eating and not eating lots of processed foods, just more calories. I guess question is, are metabolic resets a real thing, and why did my weight loss slowed so much? I know that you stop fast from water weight but 30 lbs seems like a lot for that lol. I also know I should be doing weight training, but honestly don’t know how. I have 20 and 25lb dumbbells at home, since I’m too busy with full time work and grad school to go to the gym.

I have had lost weight a couple of times during my life and I had better results in the long run and I stay more consistent, when I am not counting calories of course I am very mindful of what I am eating, prioritising whole foods, vegetables and avoiding sugar.

Anyone else like me? I just need a little support lol I feel like I will not lose any weight again, just anxious with starting again I guess, or any advice?:)",1767101838.0,67,143,loseit,weight_loss

1pzgxsc,Overeating but no weight gain,"Over the past two weeks, I’ve eaten an average of \~700 calories above my estimated maintenance. Despite this, my scale weight hasn’t changed overall. During those two weeks my weight fluctuated by a couple of pounds (from 138 up to \~140 lbs), but it has mainly stayed at 138 lbs, which was my weight before the overeating period.

My assumption is that any small amount of fat gain is being masked by a drop in water weight, but I’m curious if there are other explanations. 

For context, my TDEE is around 2000 calories. I’m 22 and a teacher on Christmas break. My activity has been fairly similar, though slightly lower than usual (average steps down to \~11k per day and gym twice a week instead of three times).

I’m back on track now the Christmas break was so needed!!!",1767097864.0,0,1,loseit,weight_loss
1pzgsc0,Can't lose weight without flow state?,"Please don't be rude to me.

I've been trying to lose weight since I was a preteen, but it always ended the same way - I would lose a few kilograms, then gain them back again in a short while. It wasn't until I turned 18 that something truly clicked - out of seemingly nowhere, I started exercising in my room without making a conscious effort. I stopped craving sugary sweets and unhealthy food out of the blue. My appetite just... shrinked. Working out was actually enjoyable.

Soon, I went from 99kgs/220lbs to 70kgs/155lbs. Apparently, that was the higher end of a healthy weight for my height (according to BMI), but I still wanted to lose some more weight.

But then something clicked in me. I started craving unhealthy food again, my workouts became less and less common, until they stopped. Each time I tried to revive them, I felt slow, sluggish and honestly just lazy. I started gaining back the weight, and I'm currently still gaining it back. I don't know how to stop it. I have a very hard time disciplining myself now. I used to be disciplined when I was losing weight, yes, but it wasn't conscious. It didn't feel like a conscious effort, it felt like a flow state that came easy. I'm not sure what to do. Is it possible that I just can't lose weight when I try to be conscious about it? But then what other way is there to lose weight? I can't just sit around and wait for that state of flow to kick in again. Anyone who went through the same thing...?

I'm feeling really sad and disappointed in myself.",1767097392.0,0,22,loseit,weight_loss
1pzf710,Need advice for losing weight from 320 pounds.,"I’m just gonna lay out the facts I guess. Not excusing, it’s just what I know. I really want to lose the weight.

\- I have insulin resistant PCOS.

\- I don’t drink juice, I don’t drink giant Starbucks drinks, i very rarely drink alcoholic drinks, and I don’t drink pop often (MAYBE once a month, IF that. I rarely drink it and if I do, I never even finish a whole can). I legit basically only drink water. A vitamin water here and there, if we’re getting fancy. Some sips of my husband’s red bull occasionally. But mostly water.

\- I don’t constantly eat takeout. Again, maybe once or twice a month. Am I making the most healthy decisions at those times? Definitely not. But it’s not an everyday or even every week thing. I don’t sneak off to McDonald’s and eat a second dinner when I get home. I don’t eat a whole pizza or a whole box of crumbl cookies in one go.

\- I cook dinner every day. Not Kraft dinner, not frozen pizza, not hamburger helper. I make meals. Spaghetti. Chili. Fish with rice and tomatoes (tejlada, if anyone here is Portuguese). Etc etc etc. I make sure there is a generous portion of vegetables with every meal and eat them diligently.

\- I could definitely use more fruit in my diet. I love fruit and I buy fruit, but tbh we’re broke and I usually save it for my kiddo.

\- late night snacks are hardest for me. I don’t go crazy always, but I can definitely crush a bag of miss Vickie’s chips. Iykyk. Again, not a daily or even weekly occurrence though.

\- my biggest meal is for sure dinner. Breakfast is small. I usually eat a granola bar or something similar because I need to eat food with my morning meds. Lunch is often salad or a bagel or some cottage cheese. I graze a little throughout the day, have some cheese cubes, some pickles, maybe a sandwich. Some carrots. (Not all of these things in one day, just throwing out my options). But that’s it. Dinner is my biggest meal.

\- my life is fairly sedentary. I need to go to the gym for sure, or pick up swimming. I love swimming. I do however go for walks every day if I can, for 45 minutes to an hour. Winter is hard though sometimes because I live where it gets to be -45 C.

I just feel a bit lost? I want to lose weight and it’s basically all I think about. I’m being truthful with my eating habits though. I don’t think I eat an extreme amount on a daily basis, but obviously something isn’t right. So maybe I am. Am I eating too much cheese? Probably.  I don’t know.

Lay it on me, I guess.",1767092102.0,5,9,loseit,weight_loss
1pze58a,Are people worried about bloating?,"Reading up on some dieting books from the 2010’s and there’s a whole 10 page section and a 4 day diet about decreasing bloating, food spending less time in your GI tract, going for fart walks after eating etc.

My question is, are people going on diets to decrease bloating? Is this for special occasions, like before a wedding or is this something people actively try to avoid throughout the week?

Im confused because bloating seems a normal part of eating food, and this is the first time I’ve considered it something a: you can even control and b: something noticeable enough to be worth it.

It is way more than I expected and I know it will slow down eventually but I am prouder than ever. That being said, I was expecting to see changes in my body, but I can't see any yet and it was kind of disappointing.

I have been counting all my calories with Yazio, up to 1276cal/day, some days eating less and some more, but making sure I feel full and get all my nutrients.

I go for walks 2-3 days a week, which has been a real game changer since I could spend days or weeks indoors because of depression.

1pzcoym,How do I lose skinny fat?,So I used to be overweight and lost a lot of weight over the past 3 years and now sit at a BMI of 18.8. I’ve definitely lost a lot of fat around my body but for some reason there’s still a lot concentrated around my stomach and chest. I’m trying to get a completely flat torso but my stomach and chest just stick out too much cuz of the fat. Is muscle building my only option at this point? I’m really not interested in looking muscular even as a guy and prefer a skinny look so can I get there by continuing to lose weight or should I just pivot to muscle building? I’m also really scared of gaining weight so can muscle building be done at maintenance or does it require a calorie surplus?,1767082878.0,0,9,loseit,weight_loss

despite this, I have struggled to actually commit myself again to a disciplined routine.

My question is that if I should cut down to 145lbs or something first while weight lifting, then bulk to 160lbs and repeat. Or should I just stay at 160lbs and recomp?

Honestly, I dont ever want to go above 160lbs again since I dont want into fall into the trap of forever ""bulking"" and overeating which is how I got to 210lbs in the first place. Ideally, I want to be the same weight as I am now, but with a much lower body fat percentage and higher muscle mass percentage. I'm not trying to be a meathead. Just a lean, muscular dude. And please don't recommend me to bulk to 170 or higher. I know myself and that I lack self control. I would rather cut and bulk in the 145-160 range even if it limits my potential gains or recomp at a stable 160. I never want to gain even a pound over 160 again.

Problem is, I’m still around the same 23-25% body fat as when I started, and I want to at least reduce that to AT LEAST under 20% to reduce some of the excess fat on me, possibly lower eventually, but not if losing weight to get there would be unhealthy.

It seems like teen weight loss is kinda mixed, some sources say it’s not advisable AT ALL, some say up to a 300-500 calorie deficit is okay, personally, my plan was to lose around 0.5-0.6% BW per week, but if I had to go at a rate of 0.25%, or even 0.1% to not mess things up, I’d do it

Now one other thing, yes I could get to under 20% just by recomposition, but this would take several months and I know from several weeks of research that it’s much slower than a cut and lean bulk cycle, so if I CAN, I want to use cut and bulk cycles to my advantage, any thoughts?",1767059725.0,0,11,loseit,weight_loss

I tried going to the gym at first but I couldn't stick to it. At this time I also started consuming lots of knowledge about muscles, protein, & fat. I got overwhelmed and stopped completely after 2 months when I was 92 kg.

Then I started to think about my weight again after 2-3 months and decided to be more conscious about how I do it. I stopped trying many different workouts and techniques and only focused on 3 things. I researched a whole weekend to set these goals.

1. 1300 calories per day
2. 100g protein a day
3. 8000 steps a day

This isn't perfect, 1300 calories isn't even healthy for my weight actually but I stuck with this for few months now. I don't reach all 3 goals everyday but I do it most of the week. This helped me get from 92 kg to 87 kg.

I stopped trying to evaluate my routine as I was learning new things as it was exhausting and mentally draining. I plan to evaluate again only once I hit 80-82 kg. Until then, it's like brushing my teeth. You don't think about it.

 I will be waking up at 3 AM, and starting work at 4AM. My first break will be around 6:30AM, my lunch will be 9:00AM, and my last 15 will be at 10:30AM. I will usually get off at 11:30/12:30 then plan on heading to the gym around 1/2 PM. Then finally going to be around 7-8PM.

What I need help with the most is trying to figure out and deciding where when and how to split my calories and also what amount of calories are usually normal for certain meals. For example, should my breakfast at 3 in the morning sit in a certain range maybe around 200 to 300 or should they be more or less, or how about the meal that I eat before heading to the gym and then after the gym, these are things I always struggled with even prior, not knowing how many calories I should eat before or after certain things for certain meals. 

For context before I did work overnight I used to weigh 206lbs and I dropped down to 160lbs I gained a lot of muscle and I was starting to lean out, I was doing body recomposition with a personal trainer so when it comes to the gym, I’m pretty good there, but my biggest struggle was always the food & having the same questions that I have right now, I managed but I would love to have some outside help and some constructive criticism and great advice going into this!!

everyone tells me that eating in a calorie surplus is how you build muscle BUT (and i know this is irrational), but i get discouraged seeing the scale go up even if it might not even be fat gain. if i’m fat now, can my body rely on the fat stores to compensate for the caloric deficit? i’m afraid of gaining more weight and/or overeating :-(

1pyuigm,One month in - things to adjust? It’s hard,"Hi all, first time here.
I’m 37(F) in few weeks and I finally told myself to do something about my overall health. Almost 2 years ago my mom passed away and I dug myself a deep hole of wine (every day), beer, food and pity. 
I’m now around 82,7kg, 177cm tall and my starting weight at the end of November was 85,6kg.
At the end of November I said goodbye to alcohol, processed foods, sugar and went back to gym which I used to love. My kid is 4 and even during pregnancy and after I gave birth my weight was always around 65-67kg. Then my mom got sick and slowly it all went to sh*t. But now I got sick of my own excuses and went all in.

Changes in my diet: I introduced cottage cheese, Greek yoghurt, smoothies, protein, a lot of veggies.
I try to count my calories but due to busy work schedule and a kid I’m not 100% accurate all day, but try to stay on around 1200-1300 calories a day. I went basically low carb, I haven’t had any sides such as rice, pasta, potato, tortilla in a month

Workout: I went back to gym full on, I’m there maybe 6 times a week now which is a lot but I just love it as it’s the only time I have for myself. I usually do 25 min warmup on a treadmill (I switch between running and incline walk on around 13 incline), then followed by 25min of strength training.

My concerns: I’m not sure I’m doing the right thing about my diet as I picked very restrictive route of no carbs. Regarding calories, I realize 1200-1300 is not enough probably but I cannot fit more into my day or at least I thing I cannot as I’m scared to eat more. I’m also still not sure whether to eat full fat cottage and Greek yogurt or switch to low fat.

I expected more progress after a month not gonna lie. I did shred some kgs but maybe my expectations are too high as I was in a rut for a few years now.

1pytluw,I think I may have found an easier way to lose weight?,"When I was younger and was extremely over weight, I spent a lot of my time watching youtube videos, reading blog posts, and getting any information I could on making losing weight as EASY as possible. 

I spent about 2-3 years trying different diets, routines, and basically everything under the sun but nothing worked. I would do what they told me for a few weeks and eventually fall off, binge eat and go straight back to square one. I can’t even begin to express how frustrating it was. Feeling like no matter who I listened to, I was a lost cause.

Now as a 28yo male who’s been in the gym for over a decade I can tell you ALL of those routines, diet, and workouts worked. They just didn’t work for me. Not because I was unmotivated, or undisciplined but purely because I wasn’t THE PERSON who did those things. More specifically I didn’t see my self as someone who has the body I wanted.

I was insecure about my body, had low self esteem and was acting and trying to hard to change my body so it would change my inner feelings about myself. but the truth is my body was just an outside representation of how I felt on the inside. 

Going to the gym, doing cardio, eating healthy ISN’T suppose to be hard. Look at people who are athletes, if you ever ask them how they do it, they would be like wym? That’s just what I do. It’s not hard for them to do those things? So why is it so difficult for us.

It’s because of our self image. We don’t see ourselves as someone who goes to the gym. Who effortlessly does cardio everyday, who happily eats heathy greens and protein over a big mac. I now look at all those diets and workouts that were recommended back then and any of them would work now. Because the advice is actually good and works, but only if your the type of person who it would work for. So the answer is to become that type of person. 

I know this is kind of a out there concept to grasp but when I made this change for myself It make everything so much easier. So let me know if that makes sense?

The ONLY thing that matters when losing weight is Calories in and calories out. Exercise improves calories out, but for the average person you aren’t going to burn more than 300 calories at the gym and you aren’t going every day. 

It’s significantly easier to stick to goals around food than working out and it’s actually the only thing that matters, so focus on that. Skipping 2-3 snacks a day is the same calorie loss.

Get a meal plan, meal prep, and stick to it. Throw out every other food and drink in your house. You’ll lose weight faster with a 1500 calorie diet and zero exercise than you will 5 days at the gym eating your normal 2000+ calorie diet.

Family stayed with us from the 20th until today, we've eaten out at least 4-5x, cooked big dinners and lunches... the only thing ive tracked really is breakfast when its been something simple like eggs/bacon. Essentially ate what I wanted and just listened to hunger cues...so many cookies, brownies, croissants, butter, whatever. Still went to the gym on my usual days when I could manage, only hit my step goal (10 - 15k) like 5 times, so I was expecting the worse for my weight in today.

I only went up 1.8 pounds, 204.2 to 206, and im sure some of that is just bloating since we went out again last night for dinner and dessert, lol. 


What?? Its been in the back of my head all week that im doing too much, im gonna gain so much weight, this is gonna put me back so far, etc... but I was DETERMINED to just enjoy myself, my family/friends, and the holiday without tracking for a bit, and gained less than 2 lbs. 


Honestly, MENTALLY, this is a game changer and a huge relief. As long as I stick to it for the majority of the time a week or two won't blow the progress ive made.

My question is has anyone managed to lose 80-100 pounds in a year successfully? What are some tips you have? Also just to throw in there i currently weight over 300 pounds, high cholesterol and slightly high sugar. 
Thanks in advance! ",1767010687.0,24,37,loseit,weight_loss

1pyj8ji,Why isnt my weight loss noticable???,"My starting weight was 110 lbs around, and my current weight is 102.6 lbs. Im fairly short(5'2), and I know im at a smaller weight already. So I feel like it should be noticable faster. But its not. 


Could my scale be inaccurate? Its like 2 years old, so it could just be getting old too. I have been vaguely tracking my calories, but I dont count every little thing that goes into my mouth. But id say it ranges from 1200-1300 cals. Sometimes a bit more, but thats my best guess. 


Or is this just not enough weight to lose for it to be noticable? Genuinely asking. I thought since I am already considered a ""smaller person"" it would be noticable faster, but it has not. I took before pics, and I look the exact same. The only real difference ive noticed is that my belt fits a bit looser. But that could be because its an old belt, and it stretched out. Or me trying to cope and make myself believe that. 


Note: Im aware im in a healthy bmi range and dont paticularly need to lose weight. However, I do want to look a bit better for vanity reasons. And I already have bad weight distribution. I also dont plan to lose much more weight, I just want it to be a little more noticable ig. Im simply but asking a question, not trying to promote or ask for eating disorder related content. Ik this isnt what the sub is for. ",1767005095.0,0,8,loseit,weight_loss
1pyinb3,"in the past month, since starting a new medication, i've gained about 25 lbs","when i arrived at the hospital, i weighed a comfortable 265 pounds. i'm muscular, and 250 pounds suits me well, but i'd look particularly good at around 230 pounds. if i weigh less than 230 pounds, i'm eating less than i'm comfortable with.

i'm currently at 290 pounds, which is terrible and i hate it. It's too much fat, and now i have to lose 60 pounds, which is really annoying.  i only had to lose about 30 lbs before i was hospitalized, now i need to lose 30 kg.

luckily, I'm into dieting and exercising, but it's still not easy when medications affect your behavior and mood.  when everything is confusing, it's harder to know what foods to eat.  besides, it's holidays now and I have money problems.  i can still eat well on a budget, but the chaos and uncertainty add another layer of difficulty to meal planning.

first thing first, i need to stop gaining weight because this is just ridiculous.",1767003007.0,0,7,loseit,weight_loss
1pyi6w0,Thankyou to the person who advised to put body fat % into TDEE calculator on a post here recently,"I have been over eating for weeks thinking my TDEE was higher than it is 🥲 and haven't lost any weight for weeks despite me thinking I have been in a small deficit. 

Turns out once I put my body fat % into the calculator my TDEE goes from 1890 to 1610. So I will have to reduce my calorie intake to 1300/1400 to be in a deficit 😭 (obviously a little more can be added if I add in some daily exercise i know).

Not sure how well that will go but will give it a good go! I have lost 20kg this year and want to lose another 10kg and maintain next year. All motivational tips and ideas welcome!

But i do know before i started i was 270 (23M 6'3). After those 2 months i wasn't really seeing any progress, i just stopped going, no explanation because i dont want to make excuses other than me being lazy.... 2 weeks ago i weighed myself and now im 300lb. To start the new year i really want to push myself and make the commitment to going to the gym 1x a day, and get back on the calorie deficit, im going to weigh myself weekly this time but incase that doesnt keep me motivated, any way to keep myself motivated if im not seeing the results i want.

my body still has a skinny fat, muscleless shape which is absolutely terrifying for anyone to see me under clothing

Everyone has been telling me that that means that the weight is coming from another part of my body which I get, but it seems absurd to me that 34 lbs is 1 jean size on my petite frame.

So my journey so far was somewhat successful losing weight and phases with stress and gaining back more than i lost. 

Is there a way to lose weight and adjust this „set point weight“ to lower values?  It feels like it gets worse every time and if i never tried to lose weight i would be lighter in the end.

1pyg05b,To everyone dreading January I was 19 stone (120kg) this time last year. Here is the boring truth that actually works,"I know the feeling. You’ve probably got the last supper planned for NYE, a drawer full of new gym kit and a nagging fear that by 15th Jan you’ll have jacked it all in. I know that fear because I lived it for my entire 30s.
I work as a Senior Manager in a safety critical industry here in the UK. For years I was a massive hypocrite to be honest. I would never let my team ignore a warning light on site, but I was ignoring every single warning my own body was screaming at me. I was 120kg, constantly knackered and running on caffeine and meal deals just to get through the shift.
The biggest thing that changed for me wasn't finding a magic diet, it was realising that ""motivation"" is absolute rubbish. Motivation is that buzz you feel right now while buying protein powder. That feeling evaporates the first time it rains and you have to get up at 5am.
What actually saved me was treating my health exactly like I treat my job. I didn't go to the gym because I ""wanted"" to, I went because it was a scheduled meeting I couldn't miss. I didn't track my calories because it was fun, I did it because you can't manage a project if you don't audit the data.
Truth is, it’s going to be boring. You are going to be hungry sometimes. You are going to have days where your brain tries to negotiate with you to stay in bed. Don't negotiate. You wouldn't call in sick to work just because you ""didn't feel like it"", so don't do it to your body.
I lost 35kg (nearly 6 stone) this year by embracing the boredom and doing the graft when no one was watching. If an overworked 40 year old manager can do it, you absolutely can too.
Ignore the fads, trust the maths and just keep showing up.

EDIT: Loads of you have been asking for the spreadsheet I used. I have pinned the free download link to the top of my Profile (click my name u/Calm-Juggernaut2328 to find it",1766993444.0,3026,208,loseit,weight_loss

I intend to stop my weight loss journey at around 140-143 lbs since anything below that does not look good on me. 

In your experience, did you at least get a flatter appearance when wearing clothes or did you end up needing to lose more? Any tips on making the lower belly appear better?

1pyezfz,Is this how normal people feel all the time?,"I have gotten sick many, many, many times throughout my life but I can probably count on one hand with space left over the amount of times I've lost my appetite.

However, these past few days I have come down with what is probably the flu (get your shot, people!) and while yesterday I had an incredible appetite (like any typical day) today was just...not it. For most of the day thinking about ANY sort of food made me incredibly queasy (coming from someone who will happily eat way past fullness because eating just feels so good) and I threw up in my mouth several times eating a plain potato and about half a cup of bean chili for lunch. It's midnight and my last bite was a handful of saltines at 2pm. 

Now, I don't feel queasy but I'm just NOT INTERESTED IN FOOD. As someone who was formerly class II obese which was certainly helped by my constant willingness to eat, this is absolutely blowing my mind. I am literally so bored with nothing else to do but snacking just doesn't sound good. Has anyone else experienced this? Is this what it feels like to have a normal food drive? Is this what GLP-1 meds feel like? I'm so happy and confused. I hope my illness flipped a switch in my brain and it just stays like this forever but that is probably wishful thinking.

Track and field was basically my life from ages 12-24. Now, I'm 36M, sitting at about 285lbs, and would like to get back down to my fighting weight at around 225-235 over time. 

I can build my own weight lifting programming no problem and I can figure out my diet, but my motivation sucks. After thinking about it, I used to have a very clear goal and now I just feel a bit lost. I'll start up and do well for a month or two, but it eventually feels pointless because I'm not trying to do the thing I specifically worked for all those years. Track is also weird because although they host a couple summer meets for older people to throw at, it's not like a basketball league and people don't just gather once a week to throw things throughout the year.

That all said, for those who used to compete in a sport, what helps motivate you to lift/run and eat well when your sport is basically done for good?

1pyd882,"★OFFICIAL WEEKLY★ Day 1 Monday: Start here! December 29, 2025","# Is today is your Day 1?

​**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

​So you aren’t sure of how to start? Don’t worry! “How do I get started?” is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

# Why You’re Overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends (unaffiliated) apps like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit](http://loseit.com/) or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers. You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it’s own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn’t necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don’t need perfect. We just want better.

1pycz72,What foods/snacks can I keep? (Limited),"What foods/snacks can I keep? (Limited)

For reference, I live on center at Job Corps. I need pantry-stable snacks and food!!

I know of popcorn, and some canned veggies I can make in the microwave but that's about it unfortunately...

I 'can' keep some refrigerated foods, but my center has a bit of a theft problem- so I try to keep what I need to refrigerate very minimal.

Starting at the first of this new year I'm going to be scheduling gym time as well!! My main goal is fatloss, and I understand that I'd have to be in a calorie deficit, however I have had a history with ED- especially when it comes to counting calories, so I won't be able to give my full attention to counting each item, so I need things that are filling and low in cal!!

I also enjoy snacks quite a bit so small things that aren't necessarily super filling are welcome as well!!

Thanks to all in advance!!",1766983741.0,3,4,loseit,weight_loss
1pycys3,Is it weird that I'm so scared to lose weight?,"I guess I'm feeling this way because I don't want to look worse than I do now. I have pretty sunken, hollow eyes and nasolabial folds (that were a lot more prominent when I was smaller but still overweight) that are unfortunately genetic. My cheeks are pretty chubby but you can tell I have high cheekbones despite the facial fat. I've been seeing a lot of ugly duckling posts with people having huge glow ups with weight loss and I'm scared I'll still look as ugly as I am now, that I'll look so much older with all the weight lost. It sounds pathetic I know (and no I'm not just loosing weight so I can hopefully ""look better"") but I just want to feel better and not look worse than before. Am I the only one feeling this way?

1pycxfk,How to maintain when visiting family,"Hello, I‘ve been able to maintain (for the most part) after losing 20 pounds several years ago.  The problem I have is when visiting the parents.  Because I have no will power, I don’t keep treats at my home.  But at my parents, treats galore.  I always gain weight while I’m here.  And I am here several times a year, several weeks at a time (at their age, they need more help, and thankfully I can work remotely a bit).  By the end of my stay, I’m in a very obvious awful mood.  I would love to hear any advice or suggestions.  I’ve had them hid all their snacks, but I know where they are hidden.  I buy my own healthy food for lunch, and that has helped, but dinner is another story.  Thank you",1766983597.0,1,5,loseit,weight_loss
1pyc8rb,"I avoid the scale and looking in the mirror. I’ve failed, yet again.","I (37/m) started this year very determined. 6 months into it I had lost roughly 45 pounds, still had another 30 to lose. But at some point I just started having cheat days that became weeks, then months. Now I’ve gained most of that weight back and have to start over again next week. 

When I go into the bathroom I won’t even look up to see my reflection. I’m ashamed. How can I fail yet again? The only positive is that I have been consistent at the gym, aside from a 2 week hiatus were I busted my knee I’ve pretty much hit at least 3 times a week at the gym. But you can’t out lift a bad diet. 

This shame affects everything, I don’t want to go outside, I don’t want anyone to look at me because I’m just back to being fat again. Another year, another failed attempt. I’m tired of dieting. The first time I started to diet I was in the 5th grade. I know how to lose weight, I understand nutrition, I’ve done it, I can just never hang onto it. Earlier this year I was able to do a few pull ups, now? Barely one. 

I’m writing this not looking for advice, but just putting it out there as I am ashamed to talk about this with anyone else. I’m tired of being fat. I never want to write one of these again. I’m going to lock in and seek a therapist to help me understand why I keep repeating the same viscous cycle, start counting calories again, and continue my training.

1pyc68v,Venting about comments on how I eat!,"Okay. I'm currently traveling with my family for the holidays. One of my brothers' girlfriends often comments on how much food I can eat. She says things like, ""How can you eat so much and not gain weight?"" ""Are you still hungry?"" or ""A second plate? I couldn't eat that much."" For your information, I've lost 55 pounds over the last few years and I work out often. I'm still in deficit, but I took a break for the holidays since I'd been in deficit for a long time and... it's the holidays. I've always had a big appetite and I eat a lot (not binge eating), it's just that I usually eat this much while also being in a deficit. I'm not sure how to respond to that; it's not my fault I have a big appetite. I wonder if she's saying that because she's surprised that I've lost weight and eat so much (she told me she wants to lose weight and she doesn't eat much).

I started the year with a lot of health issues and weight loss + a surgery I had in the summer have made me feel a lot better. Mentally I'm doing a lot better too. I had to deal with a lot emotionally (reporting abuse and assault, setting boundaries with some harmful friends) and I think I did a good job not using overeating to cope as I traditionally have.

1py9cu5,Body type changed after weight loss(?),"20F, I’m 5’7, currently around 170 lbs, and for a while throughout my life I was around class II obese. Genetically, I carried a good amount of my weight in my legs and lower stomach, and I have relatively wide shoulders, giving the appearance of an hourglass. My measurements reflected that too; at my highest my bust was 47 inches, waist was around 39-40 inches, and my hips were around 55 inches give or take. That ratio held true for most of my weight loss journey. However, earlier today, I was measuring myself before buying clothes from a brand I was unfamiliar with, and I hadn’t measured myself in a while. My waist measured 29.5 inches and my hips measured 41 inches, which honestly surprised me because even in the process of losing weight, there was always around a 14-15 inch difference between my waist and hips. Visibly, my body looks more rectangular too now than it did even earlier this year. I’m not necessarily bothered by the change, but I am curious as to what might have caused it. I’m not sure if it’s bloat due to my period almost being here, or something else.",1766973492.0,17,8,loseit,weight_loss
1py8q5w,I’m 5’7 and weigh 286lbs at 17. What can I do? (F),"Hi all! I’ve decided that this year upcoming I’m really going to dedicate myself to losing some weight. I’ve put it off for a good 5 years now and after having problems with my ankle and my stamina declining from how it used to be, I know I need to lose weight and I’m ready to commit to it. I don’t have family to help motivate me or advise me on anything so I was wondering if anyone has any tips on how to go about this? 

I’m in college so I’m used to doing up to 10k steps a day recently what I can now do much easier compared to a few months ago so I know that is a good form of exercise for me. I’m getting a small job as of the new year so will definitely sign up for the gym too but what is the best machine to use and stuff?

My only main problem is I don’t have much control over what goes onto the weekly shopping list and my healthy food options are rather limited. Is it possible for me to do anything except exercise in my predicament? I’ve asked my mum before for healthier foods and it works for a few weeks before she’s back to buying junk food again and I struggle with the self control of not eating chocolate and sweets if it’s easily accessible to me when I’m bored. I’m going onto an apprenticeship in September so I will start buying my own food then but in the meantime, what can I do? I really want to make progress this year so am open to all advice.

I hope this is the best and right place to ask this, any advice would be appreciated!",1766971777.0,5,12,loseit,weight_loss
1py8p8v,Is it really a good idea to count and weigh every single calorie when starting out?,"31M, 6’ 0.5”, 187 lbs - except back in March of this year, that last figure was 172.  
  
The bottom line is that I have a pretty shit diet, since I don’t cook things consistently, and about half of what I eat at any given time is some form of fast food. I also have a…bit of a problem with chips and dip, which developed since I didn’t make cooking my own food a consistent enough habit in the six years I lived on my own before moving back in with my parents due to rent concerns. I had a shit-high metabolism until my mid 20s - I could eat just about anything and not put on a pound - but that is no longer the case.

And because I don’t work out at all, and have been flying desk for the last three years after a six year career in warehousing (which was triggering my anxiety something fierce), I’ve been gaining way too much pudge. Up to now I’ve been mostly ignoring it, or just telling myself it’s something to fix later, but realizing a few days ago that I’ve put on 15 lbs *in less than a year* kinda scared me.

So yeah - some way or another that has to change. Thing is, my goal is less to aim for a specific weight than to get (something like) my old physique back, have more energy, and to just establish healthier diet and activity habits - since habits are the thing that will stick in the long run. But a family friend told me and my mother a few days back than he lost a lot of weight because he started using the Cronometer app to count every calorie, and even had his mother control everything he ate for a little bit in the beginning (going as far as weighing every portion with a kitchen scale). Now my own mother is almost badgering for me to let her do the same - or at the very least, for her to be my accountability figure.

**I just want to know - is counting every calorie like that really a good idea?** I’m no scientist, but I know enough about the human body to understand that there’s no firm mathematical relationship between calories eaten, fat burned and muscle mass. The research I’ve done tells me that the habits and foods themselves are more important than their exact portions - for instance, my best friend told me that the workout you enjoy doing is the one that will actually count, vs. a commitment to use the office gym that I know I won’t be able to hold to. Plus, since the body wants to gain back weight, if you don’t keep up that habit forever your gains will reverse themselves - and is calorie counting the lifelong habit I want to rely on vs. focusing on eating whole foods?

Maybe I’m just being characteristically stubborn and unwilling to admit my mother is right about something. Wouldn’t be my first time. Doesn’t mean that I don’t think these are valid questions though. What say y’all?",1766971704.0,0,33,loseit,weight_loss
1py8elh,Body shaming,"I feel so discouraged right now. For context, I am a 24/F. My height is 165cm and my usual weight is at 60kg, but I gained a whopping 10kg due to overeating (I’m a postgrad student and I eat to stay awake, reward my small wins, when I’m stressed, etc - basically I eat all the time). Anyway, I recently passed my licensure’s exam and I realized I wouldn’t look good in my oath taking pictures if I don’t lose weight so I started with a goal of 10k steps per day and light workouts in the morning and stretching in the evening, combined with a caloric deficit. It’s been a month now of doing this routine, however, I recently went home for the holidays. Ever since I got here, I’ve heard all sorts of comments about my body - how big my thighs are, how my face got so rounded, etc. (My relatives talking about my body first before even congratulating me for passing my exams lmao) I want to feel good about my body but these comments make me want to give up. On the other hand, it’s also making me want to not eat and worse, its making me fear food.

1py85nz,Weird sensations during weight loss.,"Hey everyone,

33M here. I’m currently losing weight after a period of inactivity, stress, and some unhealthy habits, and I wanted to ask if others experienced strange bodily sensations during the process of losing so far 6kgs from 108kg to 102kg. I am 180 cm with a bit of fatty liver if that matters.

I’m not talking about pain or injury, more like odd fluctuations:

- Periods where I feel very energetic / clear / almost “light”
- Followed by dips where I feel off, flat, heavy, or mildly anxious
- Cold sensitivity at times (hands/feet feeling colder than usual)
- Increased body awareness (circulation, temperature, etc.)
- Some days feel great, others feel weird — but performance is generally fine

I’m:
- Exercising again (cardio + squash)
- Eating less / sometimes fasting
- Losing weight gradually
- Cutting down nicotine
- Sleeping okay overall

Nothing is constant or worsening, and I can still exercise and function normally — it just feels like my body is recalibrating rather than declining.

I’m curious:
- Did anyone else experience waves like this during weight loss?
- Did things feel a bit unstable before settling?
- Did the ups and downs smooth out with time?

Not looking for medical diagnoses — just real experiences from people who’ve been through weight loss and body recomposition.

Appreciate any insight 🙏",1766970213.0,3,8,loseit,weight_loss

1py6tp2,On vacation and struggling,"Hey guys! I’m on a short family vacation and I’m having a hard time staying on track. In my culture, you’re often told not to lose too much weight and to “eat your weight in food”. Family members have told me I’m losing too much and that I shouldn’t lose any more. Which honestly doesn’t bother me too much but it can be hard when they give you food to eat and you don’t want to be the only person who didn’t finish everything. So I’m having trouble not feeling self-conscious about my meals and feeling like I’m being watched. I’m trying to remind myself that at the end of the day I’m the one eating it lol.

I’m SOOO close to my goal weight with only 17lbs left to go. I know how important it is to navigate these times during weight loss because I’ll need to be able to do so during maintenance. I’ve been thinking that maybe I need to solidify my personal health values and beliefs. I feel like on vacation I eat and still feel hungry. It’s also really hot here and even with water I feel like I haven’t eaten. I’ve been trying my best to encourage myself that I’m still in control and that I’m not out of control and my one or two big meals don’t make me a failure. But I think it’s not having things like a scale, my usual daily weigh ins, a proper exercise routine and equipment that make things feel overwhelming and out of place. Any advice?

1py6jcs,None of my clothes fit after weight loss,"A bit of a rant. I have lost about 20 pounds (I went from 145lb to around 125lb) and a large majority of my clothes no longer fit. I had to purchase new jeans and a pair of trousers for work a few months ago. Today I purged my closet of everything else that doesn’t fit. My tops still fit but none of my pants/skirts/dresses/pajamas work. I was hesitant to get rid of stuff because I didn’t know if this would last but I was genuinely sick of having a closet full of stuff and nothing to wear (because none of it fits). Of course I’m super happy with my results so far and hoping to lose a little bit more before calling it but this is definitely an expensive side effect I wasn’t really anticipating. I didn’t think I would have to get rid of so much stuff. And I also have to explore/find my silhouettes again. The cuts of pants I used to get were focused on hiding certain aspects of my body and I actually don’t like those shapes on my current body anymore so it’s not just a matter of buying my old stuff in smaller sizes. In my opinion, I built a beautiful wardrobe over the years so it’s a bit painful to watch it go and have to rebuild again. It’ll all be ok and honestly I am so much more confident and excited about life after the weight loss so this is a small downside. ",1766966001.0,19,16,loseit,weight_loss

As it is every moment that I'm not insanely busy, I'm just thinking, thinking, thinking. What should I eat, when, how much. I hate feeling obsessed.

1py4u7v,How to Work Out without Feeling Like I'm Dying.,"35F here. Been big my entire life. In Jan 2025 I weighed in at my highest at 544. My primary connected me with a weight management program, and with the help of medication, Im now hovering between 466-478. The meds are starting to make me sick, and long story short, I need to do something else. I just went for a walk for the first time in so long. I went 1 block away from my home and by the time I got back, I felt like my chest was going to explode. I want to be healthy so badly, but I dont want to pass out on the side of the road. I feel stuck and discouraged. I know losing 70ish pounds is a big deal but not being able to walk a single block STILL is so defeating. Any advice? Encouragement?

Edited to add: Thank you to everyone who left encouragement and helpful advice. It truly means a lot that you would take time to help a stranger feel not so discouraged. Just a few notes:

•Quite a few people have suggested a pool/water walking. While I agree that is a great idea, I don't have easy access to a pool right now, but I will see if there is a gym in my area that offers that amenity. 

•Many people suggested starting smaller. Today I walked exactly half of what I did yesterday, and while it was still difficult, my recovery time when I sat down was much shorter, and I wasn't worried for my life. I'll keep that distance for now until I feel stronger. 

•There were a few people who reminded me that chair workouts are a thing. I used to do them here and there and literally forgot they were an option. I will be doing those as well moving forward.  

•Almost every comment said to focus on my diet until I am at a more manageable weight for exercise. For a long while, I was tracking my protein and carb intake only, per instructions from my WM doctor. About when I started to not feel great due to the meds, I stopped caring about every single number, and while I didnt over-indulge, I certainly could have been doing better. Today, I am back on track watching what I put into my body.

Again, thank you all so much for your help. Hopefully it won't be too long before I can comfortably walk that block and more (and if it takes longer than I want, that's okay too).",1766961698.0,155,110,loseit,weight_loss

1py1p53,Is it okay to be lazy sometimes with meals? and eat horribly if it isn't above you cal limit? (Mini calorie rant inside),"So today for breakfast I had two mini muffins, and a beef jerkey stick that comes out to 300 cals.


My cal limit per day is now 2000

This bag of chips , siete sea salt is 6 servings at 140 cals a serving.

And this turkey sub, that is 11 inches... well here comes the damn problem.

It's not 550 like the calorie count says on the packaging, it isn't 1400 like every estimate i've ever seen ever.. it's apparently an anomalous thing that no company on earth can EVER get right, no matter where you go. It has no oil, no mayo, no vinegar. Hell its practically all bread.

How is it that no company ever discovered how to accurately calculate these things, the same place has a tuna sub at 1k calories.. and the chicken salad sub at..433?

It's so frustrating man, like absolutely so frustrating, that I cannot trust ANY calorie content of literally any packaging.

I know i would like to do some kind of combatsports, but due to my job as a psychnurse i cant really partake in anything around me. So because i dont find any movement of my body fun due to sweating and heating up, which gets me angry and annoyed af (audhd) the only thing i could do would be going to a gym or some kind of calisthenics. What kind of approach did u have experience with or did u try? My main goal is to get stronger / build more muscle - for getting / being stronger. 

  
Maybe some ppl found ways they were able to overcome the initial struggle or can recommend anything related. Ill try to answer questions and will edit my main post with the sensible additions.

1py16nr,Anyone genuinely felt that they would never lose their stubborn fat until they truly tried exercising + dieting and it worked?,"
For context, I’m skinny fat. My BMI fluctuates from 18-19+ but never above 20. I don’t count my calories but I know I rarely overeat because of what I eat + the volume of it. I have tracked my calories before for a while and it’s usually around ~1500, some days a little less some days a little more. 

I tried exercising for 2 months and I focused on weight/strength training, increasing weights etc. and while I was noticeably stronger I looked exactly the same. 

I absolutely hate my waist and arms. I got a broad waistline (it’s usually around 28-29 inches, I look like a box) but I have quite a lot of pinchable fat all around my waist. My arms are considered very slim as well (slightly under 10“) but there is a pudge that sticks out more than my shoulders that are already structurally broad so I look even wider. 😕

Now I’m heavily contemplating liposuction for my arms and abdominal area just so I can have a peace of mind because these two areas have bothered me for so long. I also do intend to exercise again but I feel like always seeing my excess fat / shape makes me feel so demotivated that’s why I give up. Maybe liposuction could take this demotivation away and I can focus on building muscle. 

Both my parents have bellies like mine. And even though I’m a woman my body is so masculine 😔 

Hope to hear from y’all. I’m tired of how my body looks :(",1766952783.0,28,16,loseit,weight_loss
1py0754,Any advice at all,"Hello, all. I haven’t been on Reddit in quite some time but I’m feeling a little desperate and need some advice…any advice. 

Some background information: I grew up in a very unhealthy household. Mentally, physically, you name it. I struggled with self-confidence and my weight pretty much my entire life. I was always around 145 to 150 in high school (5’3 so I think I’m considered petite) and felt so…gross. 

I was 145 when I met my husband, and that was my weight when I got pregnant the first time in 2023. I went from 145 pounds to 198 pounds during that pregnancy. It took me almost 2 years to lose back to 155. I tried several diets and exercise routines over that time but nothing ever lasted more than a week or two before I was exhausted or so hungry I was nauseous. Fasting changed that, but it still took so long and I had to be so careful, I was quick to eat even an ounce too much and gain several pounds back. One missed day felt like weeks of setback. I finally hit 155; I wasn’t that happy with the way I looked but I was proud I had finally made it that far. Thanksgiving of 2024 I found out I was pregnant again. My emotions snowballed but I managed to watch how much I ate. I went from 155 to 196. Not a startling difference, but enough that I wasn’t entirely discouraged to try and lose again. 

I had my second child in July of this year and pretty much started researching different weight loss habits and methods as soon as I was healed enough to start exercising. I found a set of videos that were low-impact strength training (which was the best as per the research I’ve done). I found a channel called Coach Viva on YouTube that detailed “lazy” ways to lose fat, which were mainly small lifestyle changes that added up over time. 

I’ve started trying to incorporate more vegetables by buying fresh over canned. I’ve started trying to have more fruit by making smoothies with oats and Greek yogurt. Greek yogurt has replaced sour cream in my meals when we have dishes like homemade burritos and chili. I’ve started adding cottage cheese to my scrambled eggs. I’ve managed to stick to exercising at the very least three times a week for at least 10 minutes each session. I don’t eat chips, I don’t bake sweets like muffins and cookies anymore, I stay away from candy except for the occasional Reeses Cup when I go grocery shopping as a treat for myself. I drink more water than I ever have in my life, and I’m shooting for a liter by at least 6:00 P.M. every day. I’ve cooked meals for the last three to four years, and NEVER eat fast food anymore. I’ve started drinking coffee with literally an ounce of creamer only (I measure it out) and trying to keep up with herbal tea at night to calm down and get good sleep. 

I’ve managed to go from 189 pounds when I left the hospital to 155. But that’s where the progress stopped. I’ve been bouncing between 155 and 162 for about two months now. None of it seems to be working anymore. I checked my weight last Monday (my weekly weight check) and I’m back to 164. Since then I’ve been pretty discouraged and have just kinda drifted. I’m pretty sure I’ve gained more than that back and I hate it. I’ve worked so hard to lose and the progress just stalls and goes backwards, even when I’m doing everything “right”. At this point I would suck it all out with a vacuum if I could. 😭 it’s impacted my mental health and self-confidence/esteem immensely, which in turn has affected my relationship with my entire family. I’m looking into therapy to help but I won’t lie, I absolutely hate myself right now. I want to hit at the very least 125, but 120 is my goal. 

Any advice is much appreciated. 🖤",1766950438.0,0,18,loseit,weight_loss

First thing I noticed was that my diet before dieting was absolutely horrendous. Second thing I noticed is that I've developed a fear of eating anything over 300 calories or 100 mg of sodium. I feel like I can't eat anything because everything is high in sodium. My counter is set at 1800 per day but I'm consistently hitting under 1200 out of fear. On Christmas I found out I was 94 calories over my budget and I started sobbing, even though I was at a party for most of the day.

1pxuihh,Looking for advice on fat loss + muscle gain while struggling to hit protein,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice and perspective.

I’m **4'11, 71 kg**, with a long term goal of reaching **45 kg**. My main focus is **fat loss while maintaining or building muscle**.

I’m currently targeting around **1,500 calories per day** and aiming for **120 g of protein daily**. I track my calories consistently and I cook most of my meals. My diet is **high protein, high fiber, lower carb**, and I avoid added sugar due to **PCOS**. I’m also trying to limit gluten.

Here’s where I’m struggling.  
Because my calories are limited and my meals are very filling, I get **full very fast and stay full for hours**. I genuinely cannot stomach more food for the day that I can't eat more thus less protein intake. To hit high protein, I end up spending a lot on meal prep and protein focused foods, which is not sustainable long term.

I’m worried that **lowering my protein intake** might affect muscle retention, strength, performance, or overall health, especially with PCOS and being shorter.

Has anyone been in a similar situation 

* Is 120 g protein necessary for someone my size?
* Would slightly lowering protein hurt muscle retention if calories and training are consistent?
* Any tips for **budget friendly, easy to digest protein sources** or meal timing strategies?

I’m trying to do this in a sustainable and healthy way and would really appreciate any insight or experience.

Thank you 🙏",1766937007.0,2,4,loseit,weight_loss
1pxtozb,I lost 120lbs this year and it was the worst,"6’3 male. SW 340lbs, GW 195, currently 220.

I decided to commit to weightloss in January with three very simple rules. 

- 1800 calories a day.
- 12,600 calorie weekly budget 
- never ever go over 2200 in a single day (to allow for special occasions and the odd event) 

Couldn’t have been more simple and my god did the weight melt off. By month 6 I had really smashed it and that’s when it all went very wrong. 

I had a very horrible pain in my abdomen/chest which (at the time) I thought was a heart attack. After a trip to A&E, a round of blood tests and a review from a doctor, nothing showed up. A blip perhaps? 

A month later the pain came back. In that time I had self diagnosed myself with a gallbladder issue which was then confirmed by a doctor.

Turns out that you shouldn’t just lose weight rapidly because your body will continue to produce bile (stored in your gallbladder) which then turns to gallstones when unused.

I’ve had multiple hospital stays, infections, late night trips to A&E which led to me having my gallbladder removed two days before Christmas.

Just a friendly warning to those of you on your journey or potentially looking to start in Jan. Please monitor your weightloss with the help
of a medical professional. The pain and suffering I have been through over the past couple of months has been miserable. 

Edit:

Just a point that my issue here was very much self inflected. Not only didn’t eat enough but I had unintentionally stopped eating enough fat in my diet. A well balanced diet is key and gallstones are not a guaranteed byproduct of weightloss! ",1766934945.0,1764,161,loseit,weight_loss

1pxsle0,Is there a way of knowing which scale is most accurate?,"My main scale is around 15+ years old so I bought a newer one two years ago worried my main one was too old. Back then they showed a difference of 200 grams (0.44 lbs), so I decided to keep using my older one for a consistent trend in numbers. Yesterday I accidentally dropped my older one and it temporarily showed ""1.4kg"" whilst nothing was on it before going back to 0. I used the scale afterwards and it showed I had gained an entire kilo compared to last week which could certainly be possible due to Christmas Eve. I had however kept following my diet during the celebrations and the number that was showing on the scale was the exact same one I had plateaud on for weeks, so I ended up double checking with my back up scale. That one showed me the exact same weight as last week, meaning an entire kilo (2.2 lbs) difference between the two scales. It shows a complete difference in the trend of the numbers, gaining an entire kilo or maintaining and it's driving me crazy. The 200 grams changing to a 1 kg difference also confused me more on which scale to trust now. I don't know if the scale slamming down somehow damaged the older one, or if the lack of use of my newer scale somehow damaged that one.

  
Specifics:

older scale: digital; activates by stepping on, stepping off, letting it calibrate itself and when it show a zero, step on again to be weighed; shows the exact same weight when stepped on multiple times in a row, unless you weigh yourself holding nothing, weigh yourself again holding something heavy, and then weigh again holding nothing, then weight 1 and 3 varies; stationed on the ground floor on tile

Newer scale: digital; activates by stepping on and weighs you immediately; if you step on it the first time, get off, have it return to zero again, and step on again then weigh ins 1 and 2 differ but all consequent weigh ins will be the same as 2, if you step on it holding something heavier and then stop on again without holding anything, that last weight will also be the same as weigh-in 2; stationed a floor higher on parquet flooring

  
I'm tempted to switch over to the newer scale due to its consistency, but I don't want to accidentally think I maintained when in reality I gained an entire kilo. I'm also worried it's somehow damaged due to lack of use and therefore showing a wrong weight. Is there a way to know which one is most accurate?",1766932050.0,0,8,loseit,weight_loss

I've had surgery and been on medication to help it. But it didn't help. I need another surgery but it's not an option right now.

I've been slowly stacking on weight for years now from binge and emotional eating. I am 172cm/5'8 and was usually around 68kilos/150 pounds and I went up to 100kilos/220 pounds, I'm now at 86 kilos/190 pounds.

Food was the last thing that would bring me happiness. I have pain from halfway down my back to my toes. I have nerve damage and sciatica. Parts of my skin are numb, then feels like boiling water being poured over it, then an ice pack being held. There's been times I've gotten up and nearly fallen over. And there was two days where I could not walk at all. 

Sitting hurts, lying down hurts, even deep breathing at times hurts. I am so tired. When I spoke to the surgeon, she said the next suguery might not help because of the location of my endo.

Going into the holidays I was at my goal weight and I’m up at least 3 pounds if not more (frankly scared to step on the scale). My house is full of cookies and chocolate and all of my extended family are amazing chefs who’ve made delicious heavy meal after delicious heavy meal. I’ve been having a ball eating and drinking everything in sight but I feel so full every night and can’t stop eating even at home, I just go back for one more cookie or treat to the point I’m physically uncomfortable. Not only have we had all the holidays to celebrate, but I have multiple family members with winter birthdays that must have dinner and a cake!

I know things will shift back to normal in a week or so and we’ll have our regular healthy food in the house, and losing \~5lbs will only take a few weeks, but it’s just a challenge with this being the first holiday season following a weight loss journey and the mental acceptance of I’m just gonna be a little squishy following a month of (very fun and worth it) gorging myself on seasonal goodies.

1pxjlzn,M24 in need of change desperately . Please help,"For starters, I’ve tried so many times to lose weight and be healthier. Every time I get into it, life gets too hard and I drop the effort to focus on other things.

As of right now I am 300 pounds give or take (137kg) and 6’8” (2 meters). At my heaviest I was 345lbs.

In 2024 I dropped a lot of weight after I started working as an automotive technician, shop was outdoors, long hot summer up to 98F most days, and I work really hard. I would sweat constantly. Drank tons of water. I she’d weight down to 285lbs. That winter, my position changed to a manger role, and I picked up that weight again, and decided to start going to the gym, had a healthy diet due to my wife being pregnant, and paid for a personal trainer. But even with all of that, I didn’t drop back below 300lbs and I’m stuck at that weight.

I need help understanding how to drop the weight. I have poor self image issues, constant state of body depression, and finding the energy to even do mundane tasks is incredibly difficult. I have low stamina, no patience, and constantly arising health issues. This weight has also caused trouble in my marriage, and it’s not my wife’s fault, she loves me but isn’t attracted to me nearly as much as she used to be when I was thinner and healthier. And it’s my fault. I believe if I fix the weight and get healthy, I can help the depression and build my confidence back. 

So here is the circumstances:
Financially I have very little to go on, not enough to pay for a gym membership, and definitely not a trainer again. 

Dieting has been hard due to healthy options being more expensive, and when I do eat healthy, I end up in an urgent care or emergency room for symptoms of malnourishment.

I work 70 hours a week, and have 2 days where I’m with my kids all day.

Botched surgery on my feet when I was 18 means I cannot bend my toes without pain, or drop anything on them. 

Have very little clue what I’m doing in the gym. Or even at home. 

All the fat is in my chest (manboobs), belly, hips, thighs and upper arms. Calves are astonishingly toned.

I need to know what I can do, and how hard I have to work to achieve my goal and what a healthy goal is.

Any advice helps

1pxi32v,Tips for losing weight in college?,"Hello!

I don’t post much, so I’m sorry if there’s any issues!

I’m 5’ 8”, female, 21 in March of 26. Currently I weigh 295, give or take about 5 pounds. I want to lose 75 pounds in 2026 (cliche New Year’s resolutioner, I know I know). 

I recently got access to my medical records and saw I was classified as morbidly obese… major kick in the pants. Beyond that, I’m just tired of being big. I hate how I look and I have that I’ve never experienced being comfortable in my own body or with my own appearance.

I guess my first issue is that I’ve never intentionally lost weight before, and have never been able to stick to going to the gym for very long. Which I have less of an excuse for because I live with my folks and they have a pretty nice in-home gym.

I know I need to push past motivation, into discipline and commitment. Historically though, I just have not been that type of person. I guess I’d classify myself as a hedonist. I do what feels good, when it feels good. It’s lead me to some very unhealthy places in life, weight just being one of them.

My major worry is with my schooling. I tho k I can find the day-to-day perseverance to work out and eat right, but I’m very worried about when my coursework really starts to pile up. I’m in a very demanding major, biomechanics, and the classes are a LOT. My semesters consist over countless all-nighters, a lot of quick-fuel foods or food that makes me feel good, and little time for most things. 

I’m most worried that when classes pick back up again, I’ll be so exhausted from coursework and studying that I won’t have it in me to work out, and I’ll slip back into my binge eating habits… 

Are there other student here? Are there any tips or tricks that might help me along the way? Or maybe even just some words of encouragement to keep in mind when things get tough? 

I’m excited for who I could be at the other end of this journey, but scared that like will get in the way.

Thanks for taking the time to listen to me whine about my issues, and a bigger thanks to anyone who has anything that can help. 

Love y’all ❤️",1766895896.0,2,23,loseit,weight_loss

1pxdxhl,Advice last 20 pounds,"SW: 315, CW: 175, GW: 155, 43F, 5'9

Looking for advice on the last 20 pounds hopefully by March. 

Over the past 18 months I've lost about 120 pounds total down 140. Since February I've been working with a longevity coach and really buckled down with exercise and a focus on protein and recently fiber. 
I'm using Monjuro, AOD, and since November Sermorelin. 

Since February with the help of my coach I've gone from 43% body fat to 24.5% body fat,  gotten my body fat  mass from around 100 to 43.2, and my visceral fat has gone from 20 to 7. 

 So I'm really proud of all my hard work! I'm feeling stronger, smaller and more fit than I've been my adult life. The lowest I've been able to get to in years past was about 210 before falling into poor habits. 

I'm turning 44 in March and really want to get to 155 pounds and would be thrilled to get my body fat to 20%  Ive been losing about 4-5 pounds a month. 

I'd really like to try to kick it up and see if I can get to my goal. 

Here is my current routine any thoughts or tips on how I can get that last 20 in the last 2 months. I've been pretty steady but would love to see if I can push it. 

My current routine 
Exercise: Weight training 4-5 week, Zone 2 cardio 1-2 week
Average exercise time: 200minutes/week 
Calories 1350
I try to get 125 grams of protein and 23 grams of fiber. My actual average is about 100 grams of protein and 12 grams of fiber. 

I'm a solo working mom so realistically only have so many extra hours for gym because of schedule.

1pxbxvq,How to diet when you’re overworked,"Hi all! I lost about 50lbs around 4-5 years ago with the help of this sub. I kept it off until recently. I’ve gone back up 10-15lbs from my lowest/goal weight. It’s not much, but it’s enough I need to rein it in.

I think the issue is my job. I’m working more hours than ever (50-60 hours/week) and I’m traveling a lot too. This has led to more high calorie/fast food as well as going hard on the sugar from the stress. Less time and ability to exercise, and less sleep is not helping either.

Any other individuals here with high stress, demanding, and time consuming jobs? What are your tips for dieting when you have no time to meal prep (something I relied heavily on before)? How do you make your life easier in your weight loss journey and prevent it from taking up mental and physical energy you just don’t have? Living on protein bars is not going well for me.

I have been on a lot of crash diets in the past, always gaining the weight back. In the past, my way of thinking about losing fat was dependent on starving and running until you can't move. So while I'm on this journey, I'm actually not sure if what I'm doing is effective. I still run, usually 3 times a week to not overdo it. I'm in a 500-600 calorie deficit (losing fat is my main goal over muscle, although I still want to make some gains too) while eating 100-140 grams of protein daily. 

My waist size is about 30 inches at this point, I want to get back to about a 25 or 24 inch waist. I have the typical skinny-fat build, even when I've been smaller, most of my body composition has been fat. So even when I've been thin, I've always been soft. How do I know if I'm doing the right stuff?? Usually I'll work out whatever isn't very sore for about 40 minutes a day. What I do is pretty hard and I always do my sets until I can't anymore. This has been vastly different from what I'm used to, so I don't know if it's ""working"". What results should I expect after say, 2 months?

1px4vth,For those wanting to hit the gym on January 1st,"Go for it! 

There's this idea that new years resolutioners are hated by regular gym goers. This might make you apprehensive to actually go. The fact is, gym regulars do not care at all about new people joining their gym. In fact, they will be among the most encouraging people youll find. 

Yes, it will be more crowded and on gym spaces you may hear people talk about waiting til its march for the resolutioners to be gone. This is just a sort of inside joke. Theres only a handful of things that actually annoy gym regulars.

Don't hog equipment while youre on your phone. You need to rest 1-2 minutes between sets of most lifts. Its perfectly fine to scroll on your phone while youre resting. Just dont sit there for 10 minutes doing nothing.

Don't take up valuable gym equipment to do stupid lifts. If your gym has two bench press stations, dont take up one to sit down and do bicep curls. Just stand up and find literally any other space to do them. If youre new to the gym, youll likely not have to worry about this at all because youll likely just be doing machine lifts anyway.

Thats about it. Nothing else is going to bother regulars. In fact, regulars will usually be the first people to help you if you ask how to use a machine. Regulars usually don't mind if you watch them do a lift to see how equipment works. Regulars can be super encouraging. Most regulars see large people walk into the gym and think, ""good for them!"" Regulars go to the gym to be healthy. The gym is basically their hobby, and now youre sharing in their hobby. Don't ever feel like you should be intimidated. 

One of my favorite things to do is take a sort of mental catalog of people I see coming to the gym in January. If I see them again several months later, ill give them a little mental high five. It takes effort and commitment to hit the gym, and you should be proud if you do it.

I'd constantly be eating that kind of stuff, I could easily get through an entire 2L bottle of coke, an entire packet of biscuits and a multi-pack of chocolate bars in one day. I'd be eating frozen pizzas, takeaways, microwave ready meals etc on-top of that. Just guzzling down processed food non-stop.

I started getting on my lazy back side and actually doing my own shopping rather than waiting for one of parents to go and do it for me. I knew I loved chicken, mince, potatoes, rice, pasta, beef, steak, carrots and green veg so that was the base of my new nutrition plan. I started eating to big meals per day, one around midday and the second around 7pm. I never really tracked calories that strictly, I'd measure out my rice portions and my olive oil but that's about it. The fat started to absolutely melt off (no surprise I was probably consuming 1800-2000 calories if I had to estimate which at 185cm/165kg is very little).

I never really felt hungry during the initial part of the fat loss which is the polar opposite to nowadays funnily enough. If I eat the same amount of food now compared to 2 years ago, I'm absolutely ravenous. I'm guessing it's just horomones and the fact I don't have a huge amount of body fat left my body is starting to fight back which has been interesting to say the least. I've \*never\* experienced the levels of hunger when I try lower my intake too much as I do now which has made me respect and admire for body builders and athletes who have to cut down to single digit body fat for a period of time so much more they genuinely are some of the toughest people in the world mentally.

I never really lifted weights I just walked and now I have a very active job where most days I'm hitting 20-22k steps which has increased by overall fitness levels significantly. I didn't end up skinny fat (thankfully) due to not lifting weights, I'm guessing it's just because I eat lots of protein, probably too much honestly I just love eating meat and drinking milk that's very high in protein and just being an active person.

I won't ramble on forever but if anyone has any further questions feel free to drop them below and I'll try answer them the best I can🙌",1766857954.0,309,18,loseit,weight_loss

I finally made it after multiple months of failed attempts IN CALORIE RANGE! I kept telling myself I wanted to be able to tell the internet strangers I made it through the day
I started today with a much healthier breakfast and decided staying indoors playing video games would be higher risk for over eating. So I want to get out of the house. In the summer I’m active- kayaking, hiking, disc golf, and running. Im obese but mobile! Where I live, it gets super gross in the winter. While usually I would just stay indoors, do jigsaw puzzles and play video games, I think that is risky for more trips to the kitchen. Any suggestions for things to get out of the house? 
Yesterday I went to the store for the sole focus of organizing the toy shelves. I’m careful to match UPCs to not mess up planograms. It gives me a purpose and helps me find action figures/toys my wife/nephew/nieces may like. ",1766856579.0,108,32,loseit,weight_loss
1px2v6e,"7 years of calorie counting, is it possible to stop tracking?","22F, 5’7, SW 180 CW 118

I’m in kind of a unique situation, I lost the weight years ago as a young teen (15-16) and have happily maintained through CICO since. Now I’ve been counting calories for seven years and I’m starting to feel a little meh about the whole process. I still weigh everything meticulously and all that jazz, but part of me is starting to feel like I don’t have to go that far anymore. I guess I’m asking if anyone who found long term success with calorie counting has been able to transition away from counting and more towards mindful eating? I’m worried that if I stop counting all together I’ll start to gain weight back. I’m also worried that after spending so many of my formative years weighing out and counting everything that it’ll be too hard to stop doing that. And, above all, I don’t want to gain any weight back. I make an effort to get 10K steps a day (and usually do) and am generally active, but I’m worried it won’t be enough if I start eating over maintenance. IDK. Anyone able to do it? Did you still keep the weight off?",1766855331.0,11,26,loseit,weight_loss
1px2e2a,How I lost 25kg four years ago and where I am now…,"In July of 2020, I decided that I no longer wanted to be fat. Grappled by lockdown, I had gained extra 5kg due to over eating. I weighted 88kg, height 161cm. 

Something had to change and so I cut out all carbs and sugar cold turkey. I ate meat, protein, cheese and vegetables. You could say I followed keto-like diet but wasn’t so stringent with the carbs from vegetables. 

The first two weeks were horrible. Headaches and mood swings from lack of sugar. On day three, I gave in and squirted honey in my mouth and felt terrible. I decided to keep going. 

Six month later, I weighted 76kg. Still fat but obviously noticeable weight loss. I decided to try intermittent fasting. Basically skipping breakfast and eating all food within a 7 hour window. That worked wonders and because I had already built up discipline around food, it didn’t lead to binge eating. 

In July 2021, I weighted 67kg, just on the verge of normal weight. I was overjoyed and decided I didn’t need to loose more. But what did that mean for the diet? Nothing. It was no longer diet but my new lifestyle. I started eating breakfast but kept very much low sugar. I didn’t crave carbs the same way I used to before, so I cooked meals high in vegetables and fat. Carbs and sugar were no longer the centrepiece for my food. It went from being is it pasta or potatoes tonight to what type of meat and vegetable do I want to eat. Potatoes and carbs come after. 

Now, I weigh 60kg. In the past three years, I’ve taken up roller derby and rock climbing. I have gained muscle and my body shape has changed. It has not been calories in vs calories out. Doing more sport has not caused me to loose weight. I eat more carbs now and occasionally sugary treats, but I feel gross and bloated if I overload on carbs. 

The biggest lesson I have learned is to eat in moderation and avoid sugar and overly processed foods. I still love donuts and I treat myself to some occasionally. Biggest difference now is that I buy one every once in a while instead of eating a whole pack. 

The truth nobody wants to hear: loosing weight is uncomfortable and maintaining weight loss requires discipline and lifestyle change. Eating gives us dopamine. Modern processed foods are addictive. You need to find other ways to get your dopamine. Sport, friends, hobby, whatever suits you. But you must give up food as a source of constant comfort. That will make celebrations even more special. You can eat a mince pie and drink hot chocolate, and you will cherish them even more knowing you will have them only a handful of times a year. The rest of the time, you can learn to cook delicious vegetables and grains that give you energy and make you feel good.

1px1wih,How to know if I’m eating enough?,"I know it’s when you feel full or satisfied, but you obviously need to be in a deficit to lose weight. So you’ll end up feeling a little hungry. I’m 4’11 and 100 something probably (110-107ish?) so if I were to do a deficit it’d be around 300-400 ish which is 1200-1100 range. Would that be healthy? Because if I ate around that and exercised, I would burn off around 200 and I’d end up with 900 calories total which doesn’t seem healthy. What should I do? Eat like 1400 and exercise a lot? Help😖it then? 

Also my ideal weight loss is 1lb a week, but if that’s too much half a lb is okay. Every year in Japan, (where I spend my summer at) I don’t count calories at all over 2 months and I end up losing around 4kg. I believe it’s due to the healthy nutrients, but I’d like to lose that amount with a way that will continue even in the US and it’s unhealthy food😖",1766853002.0,0,5,loseit,weight_loss

1px0mf1,"Feeling lost and helpless, needing some help please","Hey all this may be a long one so thanks to whoever sticks around to read and give advice/comments. I’ve struggled with binge eating and emotional eating my entire life. So my heaviest weight was 315 back in 2021. I won’t go into detail but I changed a few major things in my life (broke up with ex, moved out of state) and started to do better and lose weight the good way down to around 285. I then lost my appetite for quite a few months and stopped eating almost entirely. After that I was 175 around December 2023. After I regained my appetite, thinking I had gained control over my eating disorders, I started to gain the weight again. I got back up to 255 in December 2024. I told myself this was it and I was DONE battling this every day. I took all of 2025 to try and better myself. I started counting calories (way too low around 1200 per day), taking daily walks of at least 1.5 miles - 3 miles, and upping protein intake. Through this method I went down to 225 at about April. I have been the same 225 since April even continuing what I’ve been doing with the walking and remaining active minus the 1200 calorie intake. I discovered the guys at Mind Pump and listened a lot and learned a lot. I started weight lifting on November 9th this year and I’m up to 1800/1900 calories per day with around 170 grams of protein per day. I have set routine Monday, Wednesday, Friday and my workout takes about an hour maybe a few mins past. As an example, compared to last year I feel I have doubled my strength, I could barely do a squat without any weight and now I’m able to comfortably squat my 45lb barbell (no added weights yet). The scale is still sitting at 225. I see no differences in any pictures or the way that clothes fit from the 30lbs I lost this year. I feel like I have wasted my time and I’m extremely disappointed for not hitting my goal of 175 again this year. I feel like I worked so hard and got almost nothing. I guess I’m basically asking for any advice at all. Why is my progress stalled? How long will it take for me to see any results for body recomposition and weight lifting? I have done so much research and I can tell you so much about how to do it all but I just can’t seem to get it. I’m so tired of feeling this way and looking this way even after a whole year of not giving up. Please help I need some reassurance or anything! Thank you all

1px0879,How are you dealing with holiday treats? I'm making it a game,"It's common to get chocolates and other sweets as presents this time of year from well meaning family, friends, and co-workers. Normally I'd just eat them and then go back to losing weight, or worse, binge them so I could ""get rid of them faster."" 

I'm sure some people will say just throw them away, but it's hard for me to throw out that box of fancy chocolates and grandma's cookies that she only bakes this time of year. 

Instead, this year I'm making a contest with myself to see how long I can make the holiday treats last. The homemade stuff freezes well and wrapped candy lasts basically forever. Maybe I can make it to April!

I'm sure I'm not the only one thinking about how to handle the influx of treats. What are your ideas?",1766848778.0,27,23,loseit,weight_loss

I have been dieting since October. I started at 304 pounds and am at 278 pounds. I want to try and keep going on weight loss all next year. I would like to reach 175 pounds. I don't think I'll reach it next year, but will keep trying for 2 pounds per week even though my TDEE will decline.

I have to buy 3 diabetes medicines for type 2 and don't want to buy them any more. I also want to stop buying so much food for being so fat. I have heart, kidney, and liver disease. My organs still feel bad after initial weight loss, but I hope it gets less symptomatic the further the year progresses.",1766847259.0,36,49,loseit,weight_loss

I was fit all my life then had 2 babies back to back, got up to 205 pounds and now wanting to be fit again. I've lost most of the weight and this is the tail end-ish. I'm cutting at 1500-1600, lifting 3/4 times a week, & running a mile outside about once a week. I've been back on it, tracking consistently/workouts for about 3 weeks after family visited. I am starving. I eat one meal around 12pm then my next around 5/6pm. During that time I feel weak until I eat again. I was up in the middle of the night because I was so hungry.

I've been stuck in the endless cycle of  losing weight and regaining it forever; at my heaviest I was a whooping 347lbs in 2015, and at my recent lowest I was 245lbs in September of 2025. Now, I am right in the middle at 277lbs.

I couldnt fit into my large t shirts anymore and had to ask my family for XL clothes for Christmas 😭. I even went on a blind date where we text for hours and hours and she said I like your personality but you are too fat.

Work had been very intense since the end of August and I stopped even thinking about it. I was 252 back then. But the intensity of emotions led to more takeouts, snacking, less eating healthily. I don't drink booze or anything.

I started a Daniel Fast mid December. No Meats, No Sweets, No Treats. I know No Meats sounds bad, Id agree most times but I trusted my friend who suggested it. I found if I do more restrictions it forces me not to make an excuse like this snack is meat so its ok for me. 

Last time I tried it for forty days and lost 20 pounds. This time, from December 14th with the exception of Christmas day and Today's leftovers from Christmas (I didnt eat much Boxing Day), I just weighed myself and am back down to 259.

I think Im going to keep seeing how long I can do this. The Snacking is the biggest issue I know. I need to stop entirely. So Im having Cheat Days once a week to wean myself off entirely off snacking. That is the big problem.

I love treats, and used to be an Italian Chef so love Meat too. But I find as I am stopping tjose the craving for everything goes away. Maybe as I get close to 220 again (which I havent been since 2023, when I last tried a Daniel Fast) I might be more leaniant.

1pwr5qk,~1000 calorie deficit and lost around 4Kgs in a month. Should I increase my intake or keep going?,"As the title says, I'm a 26 yo (M), starting weight of 118kg and height of 176cm and mostly sedentary. I was put on a 1300\~ calories intake per day by my nutritionist. First week I lost a solid 1kg but he wasn't satisfied and tried pushing me to cut more carbs till I hit 1100 calories which I really hated and made me stop seeing him. I started counting my own intake accurately and comparing on different sources to reach an average estimate of around 1500 calories per day which I found to be a somewhat tolerable point. After a month I managed to hit 114kg on the scale which I feel pretty good about, but I've been noticing the increased fatigue and loss of motivation hitting me hard the last couple of weeks (The amount of times I passed out snoring after a meal this past week is crazy). Is this a sign that my deficit is too large and I should increase my intake? Should that increase be gradual or sudden? What macros besides my protein should I care about? What should the optimal kgs/week loss be for me to reach a healthy weight?",1766817844.0,1,12,loseit,weight_loss

1pwo5c2,lose weight/get slim without compromising strength?? woman perspective please,"Does any body know if you can get skinny/slim without losing strength. I know that losing overall weight would lead to muscle loss but would this mean that I am compromising my strength? I find my strength to be pretty important to me, even if it's not substantial by any means but still important, but I also like the aesthetic of being very slim. I only know how to eat and train to be buff and I also gain muscle pretty easily with eating more and hypertrophy style training and the sort. But, does anybody know if you can lose weight (calorie deficit and cardio I guess) but still stay strong (lower reps/higher weight??) or at least not get too weak but without *looking* it? Like, I want to be slim but still be able to lift heavy. If I just focus on strength training and a calorie deficit, will I lose weight without getting weak????? my goal isn't to look lean necessarily; I just want to be smaller without losing my natural strength. I know it sounds silly but I don't know of anyone who does this.",1766808079.0,7,19,loseit,weight_loss
1pwni5t,Good shoes for my predicament,"Good evening everyone! Ill give you a quick run down of my situation and then ill ask my question. I am a 460lbs man at 5’11” tall. In 2022 i worked a job where i was fast walking all over the place all day long. Eventually i acquired a third metatarsal stress fracture. My foot swelled, and i was basically unable to walk for a week straight. I was given a medical boot that was a misfit and after a week i quit wearing it due to the hip/back pain it was causing. Over the past 3 years, every 2-3 months my foot would be in tremendous pain and i would have to take a week off multiple times a year. This year it got worse. Instead of every 2-3 months, it started happening every 4-6 weeks and the recovery period lengthened from a week to a minimum of 2. In July i couldnt take the pain any longer. I went on a leave of absence to hopefully get this fixed. For the first 3 months of leave my Dr assumed it was plantar fasciitis and tendonitis. We also checked for gout after reddit told me i should ask about that, there was no gout. I went to physical therapy once a week and after insurance, that was a copay of $120 per appointment per week. After wasting time and my money, she finally referred me to an orthopedic surgeon. I got in with him at the beginning of November and he told me it could be a multitude of things but he recommended an MRI. The MRI showed perfect tendon health, no plantar fasciitis at ALL and no issues with ligaments. All i had was a third metatarsal stress reaction, the same exact place as 2022. Ive been re-fracturing and slightly healing the fracture over and over and over and over again since 2022 and now the bone is having issues. He gave me a post op shoe for my foot which has been helping and 3 more weeks off of work. Although im nervous, i will return to full time work (Banker on his feet all day) in the 2nd week of January. NOW, the obvious is that i NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT. That is something i am working on and am down 10lbs, but i have to prevent future stress fractures at all cost. I bought shoes specifically for plantar fasciitis when thats what i thought i had (pair of KURUs and a pair of Hokas) but my Orthopedic dr revealed that squishy shoes are bad if you want to avoid stress fractures. I have not been able to get ahold of him and im running out of time. My question is what can i do to fully recover this stress fracture (aside from the post op shoe my dr gave me) and what shoes can i buy to prevent stress fractures and allow me to be on my feet full time again? I am at a loss and with the holidays, its been impossible to get ahold of my dr. And for the 2nd time just because i know how this reddit enjoys point out the obvious, i KNOW its my weight and i need to lose it and get healthy. Looking for real advice and recommendations.

1pwmcdl,Looking for advice on weight loss plan,"Im in my mid 40s, perimenopausal and would like to loose about 25-30lbs through diet and exercise. The issue is that for most of my life I have not really had to ever think about dieting as I have always been on the slender side. I'm 5'6 and almost 160lbs and would like to get down to 130- 135 and stay there but how? Where should I even start? I know nothing about counting calories and am not in a position financially to afford to hire a dietician or a personal trainer:/  I do really enjoy exercising but do to my busy life with 2 young kids, husband, work etc. I can really only usually workout for about 30 mins a day during the week and maybe 60 mins on the weekend. I don't belong to a gym so I rely on YouTube videos for my exercise routine which is usually a mix of weights and cardio but even there I don't know what my ""goal"" should be for my exercise? Like should I aim for my heart rate to be in a certain range? If so, what range? Im just very new to all of this and very overwhelmed by it all. ",1766802814.0,4,12,loseit,weight_loss
1pwlj3u,Lost with first steps…,"I’ve always been very inconsistent with weight loss. Growing up being really skinny then gaining tons of weight during quarantine really affected my self esteem, which I think would happen to any one.

I really want to lose weight again, the right way this time, but I don’t know where to start. I find myself struggling with food noise and the constant need to snack. No matter how hard I try to create my own plan I find myself falling back into the same cycle of eating.

1pwjzuq,Has anyone lost weight after stopping antipsychotics (Rexulti)?,"To make a long story short, I went through a very severe postpartum depression. It was so severe that I had to be put on antipsychotics (Rexulti). Before my pregnancy, I weighed 115 lbs. During pregnancy, I went up to 160 lbs. After giving birth, I was around 140 lbs, and after starting Rexulti (about a month after giving birth) I went back up to 160 lbs — and even more.
I’m honestly freaking out. I’ve never been this heavy in my life. I recently started tapering my medication and I’m now down to 0.5 mg. I have intense cravings, I’m constantly thinking about food, all the time.

anyways, im very indecisive. I pick a diet and then quit or change to different one. I’ve done most of them.

i did WW in 2015 and lost 110lbs but if you know anything about WW.. it’s not the same as it used to be  so im skeptical of it

One bite turned into a full on “fuck it” moment. I ended up eating 3 more big cinnamon rolls, 3 extra filled chicken Caesar wraps, and a lot of soda all before 5pm

1pwfupo,Feeling hopeless - scale keeps going up despite CICO and low intensity workouts. What could be going wrong?,"Stats: 29F, 5’2”, CW: 146, Body fat %: 41.6% (from DEXA scan). BMR: ~1200 (based on Katch McArdle with body fat %). Based on a sedentary lifestyle, I believe my TDEE is ~1,400.


For a little over a month, I’ve been counting calories (making sure everything gets weighed/measured so no sneaky calories). I felt like 750 cal deficit was going to make me lose my menstrual cycle, so now I’m averaging about 500.

Averaging 5k steps per day. I work extremely long days sometimes (12-20 hours) at a desk, so I don’t always have time to hit the 10k steps. Even when I have time, I’m usually exhausted and focusing on resting post- the intense work days. 

I started doing body weight exercises this week (one leg day, one arm day) and I feel like that made me feel even more puffy, and the scale went up yet again.

I’ve gained 20lbs in less than a year. 40lbs up from the last time I felt like “me”. I’m not a candidate for a GLP-1 (let me know if that’s not true) since I’ve had pancreatitis. I do have PCOS and have had some autoimmune thyroid flareup, but as of my last couple labs - my hormones, glucose-related, and thyroid levels are 100% normal (not even on the border of abnormal).

I’m miserable, I don’t recognize myself in the mirror, and it seems to only be getting worse. Does anyone have any insight? Thanks. :(

Edit: should mention that even before strictly counting calories, was mindful of what I was eating and how much (including sneaky calories like oils). I generally eat unprocessed foods - lots of vegetables. Can’t have a ton of protein (or protein/creatine products) because of a kidney issue, but still will enjoy 4-12 oz 5+ nights per week. At that time I was walking 10k steps per day.

Consuming anywhere from 1000-1500 calories a day. Burt making sure I net to a 500-750 cal deficit. Meaning - if I eat 1400 cal, I make sure to exercise to burn at least 500 calories (typically via low intensity cardio). Sometimes if I’m not as hungry (or just busy, or planned my meals efficiently) I’ll eat ~800-1000 calories, + still try to go on a walk to burn a few extra calories, if time permits.",1766785281.0,0,49,loseit,weight_loss
1pwf24h,How to get over the Christmas-week guilt?,"So, I have been in a deficit for only 2 months, have lost only a little as I am tiny, and also have a pretty low TDEE (1550-ish when I workout 3x a week).

1pwcrg7,How can I lose 150+ pounds with PCOS + rigid thinking?,"Hi all,

I am a 26-year-old woman. I come from England. I am half Caucasian and half Asian. I am 5 foot 9.69 inches. I weigh approximately 166 kg (365 lbs). I have a few health issues such as PCOS (which I believe is the main contributing factor to a lot of my weight gain) and because I have autism, I have rigid thinking patterns. For example, I feel like a lot of things are 'all or nothing'. 

So, I have gone through stages of starving myself in 2015 for months and only having bad food once every week. Then, since around 2017, I have let myself go and thought ""fuck this, let's eat whatever I desire"". I feel like I have lost all accountability of my eating, but for me it's easier to just eat anything than to make a positive change. But then I realise that I am still quite young and that I have a life to live. If I lost weight and maintained a healthy weight I could do so many things in life and just feel so much better.

I have been morbidly obese for a long time now. I was a healthy child until I hit puberty. Since then, the weight kept piling on and on and on. That was until 2015. I thought I can't live like this and then I lost 56 lbs from January 2015 to August 2015. 

Then in 2017/2018 I really let myself go and thought I don't care anymore. I went through a lot of bad stuff with potential relationships with men that didn't materialise, to getting an autism diagnosis and realising the reason I struggled so badly in life and at school was because I had undiagnosed autism.

Every year I said I would lost weight and make changes. I have made some such as not ordering on food delivery websites and getting fast food delivered every day. Even though I get takeaways about 3 times a week now. 

I am constantly hungry. My mental health has been stable for a while now, yet I am still always hungry. I am concluding it's the PCOS. I am under a weight management clinic and they offered my the weight loss injections, but realistically I cannot have weight loss injections forever. I really want to try and lose weight by myself without intervention. However as soon as I think about let's say McDonald's, I crave it and therefore want it. I did try to do a thing with myself that I only get fast food or whatever I fancy when I'm in the town centre. But then I think how can I learn to cope without my old habits of eating junk food everyday?! As soon as I think about tasty food it's almost like I cannot help myself and order it. 

Also, if I'm aware that I am meant to be losing weight and not eating rubbish, I crave it even more. It's a hard situation I'm in because I feel like I cannot cope without my food.

I've really got to start taking responsibility for what I eat. But the cravings are sometimes so intense that I feel like I have to act on the craving. Also, with the excessive hunger, as soon as my stomach rumbles I act on that too by eating. However, sometimes I am hungry but full at the same time!?

I wanted to get a leptin test but they are hard to come by in England and I don't think the doctors will refer me.

Has anyone lost 150+ or more with PCOS and these sort of thinking patterns that I have?",1766777485.0,28,50,loseit,weight_loss

Some days it’s tough to tell whether I should change something or just stay patient and trust the process. I know everyone’s journey looks different, and comparisons don’t really help, but that stuck feeling can still get frustrating.

So anyways, if you are like me and are feeling so awful with a stomach ache get a nice slow paced walk in drink some lemon water, use the bathroom a couple of times and you'll be good to go enjoying the rest of your day. 
Also - didn't gain any weight after all those sweets.

1pw7dhk,Starting again,"Hello everyone! I have decided within these past few weeks that 2026 is the year that I finally loose this weight! I am only 18, yet I weigh ≈270 pounds 😬. 
I was successful last year in the sense that I lost thirty pounds (used to be three hundred..) but I know I can do more!!
I have a few questions for the community! 
1) how do you stay motivated?? The 30 pounds I lost was in the first couple months of the year, and then I stopped caring and didn’t loose anymore after that. And this is a cycle that I have repeated tens and dozens of times. 
2) what kind of workouts do you recommend at this size? I’m pretty huge, and a lot of normal workouts don’t work the best for me. This is also combined with the fact that I haven’t really worked out before, and my muscles are weak lol. 
3) lastly, I still live with my parents (as I’m a senior in HS right now), and don’t always get the choice of what foods we do and don’t have in the house.

1pw5amj,It's time for the workout equipment sales!,"Just a reminder and nudge to add to the possible things to do list for those who do the workout thing and hate to pay full price for anything like me...

For those who workout at home or want to start doing so, this is usually the best time (and the next couple of weeks) to check out deals and sales outside of the usual shopping days in November. 

Everyone will be rolling out the 'new year, new you' sales pitch so supplements/powders/shakes will also be on sale. Check the shelf life and stock up. 

Additionally, gym people, there are going to be a lot of discounted and free trials around. Checkout some of the smaller gyms in your area as well. 

And people who want to go to the gym but are weary or nervous because you're not familiar with equipment or set ups, there are usually some personal trainer deals. Like a free session or two or 3 for the price of 1.  Honestly, you only need like 2 or 3 sessions to get gist of things and find a comfort zone. 

A reminder that the best exercise is the one you can do consistently. Doesn't have to be extensive or fancy. I lost my first 40lbs with a Jillian Michaels DVD, two 5lb weights and Zumba on Wii. ",1766758589.0,15,0,loseit,weight_loss

I’m a few weeks into my weight loss journey and a big part of that has been learning to like cooking at home more than getting takeout. It’s going well but I’m looking to maybe purchase some other small appliances.

Right now I have the standard kitchen appliances (toaster, small Ninja blender, food processor, rotary style cheese grater, hand mixer, nice air fryer). 

Just wondering if anyone has purchased and loved any other small kitchen appliances or accessories? Things like a bigger blender (although I’m not big on smoothies), a Ninja Creami or even smaller things like a salad spinner or crockpot?

Bad news is I’m sitting at 276 (275.8) lbs - which means I squandered this year.  I’m sure that some of this is water retention due to holiday fare, but I’m pretty sure it’s not more than 2 or 3 lbs.

I still have to survive a NYE party that we’re hosting.  So what though.  No use waiting for January 1st.  I’ve been working out again and have a 4 day consecutive streak of hitting the weights or cardio.  Today will be day 5.  Been away from working out for a while so this week is all about getting reacquainted with my weights and the elliptical.  Great news is no soreness so ramping up intensity will be fine.

Sad part is I know how to eat.  I like healthy food and even have zero problems eating the “hard to eat greens” like spinach, collard greens and broccoli.  I even feel full when I eat so I know when I should stop.  My problem is taste.  Food tastes good!  There’s no trauma eating or stress eating triggers.  There’s no disconnect between my stomach and brain for hunger triggers.  All it is for me is evening/nighttime snacking and that I like the taste of food.  Should be a simple fix…

For breakfast she made one of my FAVORITE meals from when I was younger(I don’t know how to translate it into english but just know that it is NOT healthy) and thank god that I weighed myself before she was done because it gave me the willpower to resist the temptation. 

The worst part about this was that she was HURT by the fact I refused the meal, she could tell I really wanted to try it and was egging me on to do so. I just said there would be more for everyone else and moved on with my day.

This is probably going to be a regular occurrence for the week that I’m going to stay home. How do I keep this up? My parents are glad I’m finally losing the weight, yet they’re upset by my methods.

1pvz3xe,Solidarity and tips for a 1 week stall.,"On December 6th, my friend took a picture of me and I was absolutely gutted as I thought I was quite fit and didn't realise I'd become that size (by just eating what I want). I'm 5""6. I have dropped from 180lb to 173lb since then by tracking my calories (1200-1500 a day) and being more consistent with exercise. 

Anyway, this week I've stalled and maintained. I'm guessing Christmas (Yesterday I was sensible and had 2500 calories - could've been an underestimate though, but definitely no more than 3000 I would say) Last week I went out for a meal and drinks with my new co workers and definitely didn't track then, however did spend a good 3 hours dancing haha. Could these have contributed?

Yeah, they've definitely contributed haven't they. I'm typing this realising what a dingbat I am. 

I will keep this post for accountability though, because I am an absolute nightmare for starting a weight loss journey and giving up at the first maintain and saying ""I can't lose weight then"". I lost a big amount of weight in my 20s, going down to 120s, which is really skinny for my frame, and it was SO easy, could have multiple cheat days a week and it still dropped off. Now I'm in my late 30s, only want to get down to 150, and fff me this shit is tougher. ",1766736367.0,5,8,loseit,weight_loss

1pvxruk,Weight Loss Stall,"Hello everyone. I am currently struggling with my weight loss journey and could really use some advice.

I am 30F, 5’3”. In September 2024, I weighed 250 lbs. I saw a dietitian, had bloodwork done, and found out I was prediabetic. I was put on a strict keto diet. I followed it closely for a couple of months, but I was not able to continue seeing the dietitian because he closed his clinic in my city and moved. With two jobs, commuting to another city wasn't realistic, so I stopped strict keto. I still try to eat low carb and continue eating things like keto tortillas because I am used to them.

At the beginning of 2025, my weight loss stalled, so I started walking 15k to 20k steps a day. That didn't help much, but over several months I did resume to losing weight very slowly. As of September 2025, I have been fluctuating between 177-183 lbs, and nothing seems to be working anymore.

When my weight first stalled earlier this year, I tried OMAD (one meal a day), but I didn't lose any weight. Looking back, it could have been because I was doing OMAD WHILE ALSO walking 20k steps a day, which stressed my body out and hold onto fat. I understand that calorie deficit is what really drives weight loss, and I do try to track calories. I eat two full meals a day. If I overeat, I try to walk off the extra calories.

At this point, I feel like I am doing everything wrong, which is why I am here asking for genuine advice. A gym just opened right next to my house, and I am considering getting a trainer and focusing on strength training.

Honestly, I feel like long term keto may have messed up how my body responds to weight loss. About 10 years ago, when I was close to 200 lbs, I simply ate in a calorie deficit. I did not restrict foods and still dropped to around 146 lbs within a couple of months. I know I was younger, my metabolism was better, and I was not prediabetic, but now I am controlling everything I eat and still not losing weight.

I would really appreciate any insight on what I should actually be doing at this point.

1pvvtsd,Don’t panic over the holidays. 🎄,"This post is for anyone beating themselves up over Christmas overages.

Calories: 3,230 kcal

Target: 2,100 kcal

Protein: 237 g

Target: 200 g

Net Carbs: 212 g

Target: 100 g

Fat: 179 g

Target: 100 g

This was my Christmas Day intake. Yes, it’s over target. Yes, it looks dramatic on paper. And no, it’s not a problem.

One high-calorie day does not cause fat gain in isolation. What it mostly causes is temporary water retention, glycogen refill, gut content, and bloat. That scale spike people fear has very little to do with actual body fat.

Fat gain comes from consistent surplus over time, not from one intentional day shared with family, food, and life.

Within 24–72 hours of returning to normal eating, excess water drops, bloat resolves, and weight trends back toward baseline. Nothing needs fixing.

The real damage usually comes from the panic response. Extreme restriction the next day. Guilt spirals. The “I’ve blown it” mindset. Turning one day into a week.

If you enjoyed Christmas and you’re back to your usual routine afterward, you’re doing this right.

Progress isn’t fragile. Your body isn’t stupid. And discipline isn’t cancelled by celebration.

Remember:

It’s not what you eat between Christmas and New Year’s.

1pvv403,Questioning my recent weight loss,"So to preface I've lost about 50 pounds over the past 6 months without trying.  I was about 220lbs. Back in lets may-june of this year. Now I'm just under 190lbs. I'm 36f, 5'2. F Cup breasts btw maybe larger, completely natural. The only surgery I've had is gall bladder removal due to frequent gall stones in highschool. I live a very sedatary lifestyle. Rarely I will have an active day where I'm moving furniture doing house cleaning. Once a week to twice a month at best. Not working partially due to mental illness.

I suffer from ADHD, depression, anxiety, ARFID, Irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, possible recent milk allergy. Frequent upset stomach, gas and diarrhea. I suffer from frequent dehydration as well due to oversleeping. I am taking venlafaxine, pregabalin, an iron supplement, atomexetine and a multivitamin. I struggle to them daily like I'm supposed tok. I was also on lurasidone. And I have trazadone as needed. My venlafaxine is being reduced. From 225 to 137.5. I am only taking 100mg because it's too much of a hassle to break open a 75mg capsule to split in half. It will be stopped completely in a few days to switch to Wellbutrin.

I normally eat 1-2 meals a day and 1-2 snack a day. Crackers a sandwich.) I used to drink a 710ml of coke a day. Stopped drinking coke on a regular basis about 3 months ago. We get fast food about once a week on average.

1pvv38j,Losing 40 pounds before turning 40,"Hello everyone 👋 
I am new here and hoping to get some support, motivation, even maybe an accountability buddy who is in a similar position or has the same goals. 
I’ve struggled with my weight and overall self image after having my second baby (I have 2 kids, now ages 3 and 7 years old). 
I am on a high dose of an SSRI which helps me immensely with my mental health struggles but also contributed to weight gain which has been hard to shed.
I don’t blame it all on the medication though, my lifestyle definitely needs an overhaul. I’m in the middle of a divorce (my choice but still very stressful), work a very stressful sedentary job, and an overall a chronically stressed out person. 
I’ve managed to stave off a formal diagnosis of type 2 diabetes but am still in the pre diabetes range, and my cholesterol is high but not high enough to start a statin. 
Despite all this, I exercise at least 3 times per week for 30 minutes at my local boot camp gym which is my happy place since it’s consistently the time I take for just me. I also have a coach there who checks in with how I’m doing overall and helps me set goals for myself, but I’m always falling short when it comes to diet. 

I’m 39 years old, 5’6 and 187 pounds. My most recent body scan showed my body fat percentage at 36%. 
My goal is to lose 40 pounds by the time I turn 40 (May 2026). With the 40 pound weight loss I want to reduce my body fat percentage to a healthier range (let’s say 24-25%?) and increase muscle mass. But most of all, I want to feel more confident in my body and health, and find a sustainable lifestyle to maintain a healthy status. 

To do this I want to:
- stay consistent with my gym workouts, at least 3-4 times per week, which is the easiest part
- walk 10k steps per day 3-4x per week, and I recently bought a walking treadmill to use during work hours 
- try a home Pilates program 3 times per week 
- drink at least 60oz water per day 
- try to consistently eat 2 meals per day (I frequently forget either breakfast or lunch due to losing track of time). For breakfast, I might have to wake up earlier than my kids so we’re not rushing so much in the morning. For lunch it might be having something within arms reach at work even if it’s not a full meal 
- try to invest and stay consistent with a local meal plan service so there’s no excuse of not having something easy and healthy with no prep needed. 
- try to get at least 6-7 hours of sleep. This is what is realistic for me and I know I could use more but this is life right now being a working mom with 2 young boys 
- avoid eating late at night 

Is this too much to start with? Are my goals realistic? 
I know I’m going to give myself grace for not hitting all of these consistently. For example, if I don’t get my steps in then maybe I’ll do a home Pilates workout instead. Or if my work day is crazy and I can’t get a workout in, make sure I get my steps and maybe a little extra. 

Any thoughts or advice is much appreciated! ",1766722046.0,6,20,loseit,weight_loss
1pvut8h,"Is it pointless to track calories during christmas/new year, or is that when it helps the most?","this might be a pretty basic question, but i’m honestly unsure and wanted to hear from people with more experience.

during christmas and new year, food is usually shared, portions are harder to estimate, and there’s a lot more snacks and treats around. sometimes it feels like tracking during this time is almost pointless because so much of it ends up being a rough guess anyway. at the same time, i wonder if this is actually when tracking helps the most, even if it’s done loosely.

for a bit of context, i’m still going to the gym regularly and trying to stay active. i also do some boxing on the side and use heavy Bag pro app for shadowboxing workouts at home and Lose it for tracking my calories, mostly just to keep moving and stay consistent during the holidays.

i’m not trying to be strict or diet hard through this time. i’m more curious whether keeping the habit of tracking in some form helps, or if taking a short break and starting fresh after the holidays works better.

for those who’ve gone through the holidays while losing or maintaining, what approach worked best for you? loose tracking, taking a break, or something in between?

would really appreciate any insight.",1766721144.0,4,70,loseit,weight_loss

1pvnxpe,"The only thing that helped me finally lose weight was starting vitamins B-complex, D3, and iron","31F 5’3” SW: 186lbs CW: 166lbs

Gained a bunch of weight on antipsychotics. Six months after stopping them, my appetite didn’t change and neither did my weight. Saw a nutritionist and got on a balanced diet. My cravings reduced, but my weight stayed the same despite eating less food less often. My PCP then told me that vitamin deficiencies can mess with metabolism. Started taking fiber, still did nothing.

  
I was previously taking vitamins for my deficiencies in B, D, and iron, but I stopped taking them because it was too expensive. Started taking them again (while continuing my nutritionist recommended diet) and lost 10lbs in my first month. Stopped taking them again due to cost and my weight loss has slowed down. Eating habits have only changed for the holidays. So I will be starting them again after the holidays.

Moral of the story I learned: weight loss is calories in calories out, but we need to have our vitamin levels, hormone levels, and other internal factors regulated to properly perform “calories out” at our full capacity.

1pvm2bp,Facing up to reality,"I’m not looking for sympathy - I just need to get this out of my system. 

I’ve been obese - often morbidly so - for most of my teenage and adult life. I’ve attributed me being single at 37 to this fact - that men didn’t feel attracted to me because of my appearance. A few have been candid enough to say this to me directly. 

Earlier this year, I started on Wegovy. I’m now at one of the lowest weights I’ve been in my adult life - around 140 lbs, 5ft4. I’m now at a “normal” BMI. However, the years of being overweight has left me with loose skin and deep stretch marks all over my body. 

I won’t lie - one of my biggest motivators to lose weight has been to find a partner. I saw my weight as being the key barrier to this. 

Over the past month, two men I was seeing ended things after sleeping with me. After probing, one of them told me it was because of my body. This body that had lost weight, that I had felt so proud of. 

I’m shattered. I’m all for the self love train but … I’m shattered. This is the only body I have. Even laser treatments and surgery will only go so far to fix this. 

I feel so, grotesque. And unlovable. And right now I just want to try and learn and reconcile myself with the real possibility that I may never have a partner. I understand that people love each other despite physical defects but… I guess after so many years alone, I just don’t see that happening. 

I just needed to get this out. Weight loss is great, I’m glad I did it, I’m going to keep on doing it. But… yeah. ",1766694444.0,2,3,loseit,weight_loss
1pvlw8f,65 lbs weight loss advice,"I’m an 18-year-old male weighing about 255 lbs, and I want to lose as much weight as possible by February in order to be more competitive for a Navy scholarship. I’ve been wondering if aiming to lose around 65 pounds in that timeframe is realistic or if it’s too aggressive. I’ve already started working out every day of the week, usually anywhere from 45 minutes to as much as two hours, and I’m fully committed to putting in the work. My concern is whether pushing for that much weight loss in a short period of time would actually hurt me physically or negatively affect my performance, especially when it comes to running, strength, and overall endurance. I want to improve my fitness, not just see the number on the scale drop, and I’m trying to understand what a challenging but healthy goal would look like given my age, size, and timeline.

At the same time, I’m looking for advice on how to make the most progress possible between now and February, even if 65 pounds ends up being unrealistic. I know that working out alone isn’t enough and that nutrition, recovery, and consistency all play major roles, but I’d appreciate guidance on how to structure everything effectively. My goal is to lose as much fat as I can while maintaining strength and improving my cardio so I can perform well on Navy fitness standards and show real improvement.

Hi everyone, 

Hope you’re doing well. Merry Christmas to those who celebrate.

I have had a bad case of ana 2,5 years ago and logically gained more weight after. It was just around 15 pounds and I remember thinking “yeah I can lose that quick”

However my spine gave up on me and now I’ve been struggling for over a year. First few weeks I couldn’t even walk/stand/sit, now I’m starting again but it goes too slow.

Worst thing - extra 15 pounds turned to extra 50 pounds. I lost everything with that illness and now I’m stuck no matter what I do.

My pre-ana weight was 140lbs.

Ana weight was around 100lbs when I last weighted myself.

Now I’m 190 and just so unhappy. If there’s anyone who wants to talk, has any advice or anything PLEASE let me know because I feel like I’ve lost my life.

Edit: I didn’t fit into size 14 this Christmas and my whole family saw. My mum, who was the og reason of my struggling, keeps being it up.

1qahmv4,How the heck do I not just eat candy the whole time?,"Here's my situation:

The way my sugar cravings work, is that, if I have a craving, and fulfill said craving, I just want more next time. Calorie counting works great to mitigate that, because there's only so much I can have.

The thing is, I usually diet on less (not encouraging, just saying what works for me), because what happens is, when I go on 1200, I just fill the additional calories with more sugar + chocolate. For that reason, 1200 is usually tough for me, because it just makes the cravings more difficult to manage.

What I really really want to do, which I haven't figured out yet how, is to eat 1200 calories with more well rounded + wholesome / filling meals, instead of just eating nothing but protein and chocolate the whole time. But that takes a lot of work, and I haven't been able to figure out how to crack it.

I did this before but they always came out really dry and sad because I didn't use oil. However, after taking some of your guys' suggestions, I made them taste quite pleasant (20 second increments and constant stirring). Second image is soft boiled eggs. I am still trying to perfect the perfect soft boiled but otherwise these are delicious! 

Thank you so much for the suggestions! They really helped me :)

I start by steeping one bag of David’s Tea “Just Peachy” (10cals) and one bag of green tea (0cals) for taste and health benefits. You can do this cold or hot! Hot is quicker to steep while cold may take longer, but if you are in a rush cold would be quicker overall since you won’t have to cool it.

Next step is to let it cool down if you used hot water. 

Then you can add any sugar free lemonade of your choice. I used Minute Maid strawberry lemonade. I would add until it suits your tastes. I like mine sweet so I make sure to add more lemonade than tea. 

I would recommend mixing before you add the ice so you make sure not to overflow your cup when putting on the lid (oops)

What can I do to make them taste somewhat okay with very few calories (spice mixes, marinades). I don't want to waste calories on unnecessary fats like oils because I eat like 4 eggs already. 

Update: 
Thank you guys so much for your suggestions, I am no longer an egg hater! I tried a soft boiled egg with salt, pepper and a little bit of soy sauce—it tasted incredible. 

The main issue I had was how rubbery and plain the white tasted. However, with soft boiled eggs, it isn't nearly as rubbery and almost melts in your mouth.

1q3havj,Lasagne for 386 calories and 33g protein per serve 😋,"I’m actually so happy with what I’ve made today!! 🥹😍 I’ve also added pics with the list of ingredients I used if anyone is interested - The only thing I didn’t list is salt, pepper and spices, (mostly garlic powder and taco seasoning). 

Things I did differently compared to normal lasagne to make it lower calorie:
- I didn’t use any oil or butter AT ALL. I’ve actually been doing this for a few weeks now and realised how easy it is to cook without adding all those extra calories!! 
- Used lean beef mince
- Added carrots, frozen spinach, diced tomatoes, capsicum and mushrooms to the mince (3rd pic). I got this idea to add veggies to the mince for volume from the comments on my first post on this sub. Thanks guys. 
- Used cottage cheese, Greek yoghurt, high protein milk, aioli and siracha for the sauce 
- Used eatlean shredded cheese (it’s the best option I could find in Coles and Woolies - 42 kcal and 9g protein per serve) 


It turned out quite yummy and it’s actually almost like regular lasagne tbh. Only thing that could be improved is that it turned out a bit too watery but I’m assuming it’s cause I added yogurt and milk to the sauce 😅

I had 1 slice for lunch and gonna be having 1 more for dinner tonight. Then I’ll have 2 left for tomorrow’s lunch and dinner. That totals 772 calories for lunch/dinner  for these 2 days, and I have plenty of calories left to eat breakfast/snacks 🥰🥰

Btw if anyone living in Australia sees this, I would rlly appreciate any advice on any lower calorie cheese or lasagne sheets options. I got the coles lasagne sheets which is 222 calories for 2 and a half sheets 😭 and the eatlean cheese is 42 calories a serve. 

Looking for lower calorie options here is kinda hard ngl. Like back when I posted the wraps I made for breakfast, ppl commented to just buy low calorie ones but thanks to a couple Australians warning me abt them not being that available here, I wasn’t too disappointed. After some searching though I ended up buying the lowest calorie wrap I could find at Woolies which is BFree gluten free sweet potato wraps at 78 calories a wrap!!

Anyways, any tips or recommendations abt low calorie cheese / pasta in Australia would be muchhh appreciated!! 🙏🫶🏼🫶🏼",1767503722.0,75,8,1200isplenty,weight_loss

I’m deeply afraid of the consequences my body will face but I still just want more and more and im so physically uncomfortable but mentally I just want to eat. I haven’t had this problem outside of the past 5ish months, like I said. 

My question to you guys is, have any of you faced a similar problem, and if so, how did you “fix” it? How do you shift back away from momentary satisfaction to stay within your diet?",1767323737.0,12,33,1200isplenty,weight_loss

1pzg4kt,I finally figured out how to enjoy shirataki rice,"For the longest time, I thought this stuff was just diet suffering in a bag. I’d buy it with good intentions, rinse it, throw it into a meal, take a few bites, and immediately regret my choices. It filled me up, sure, but it always felt bland, a little weird, and honestly not worth the effort. What finally made it click was realizing I was using it completely wrong. You can’t treat it like normal rice and expect good results. The game-changer for me was rinsing it really well, then giving it a quick simmer in plain water before draining it. That one step alone gets rid of the odd smell and improves the texture way more than I expected. After that, flavor is everything. Shirataki rice needs bold, concentrated seasoning. Soy sauce, miso, spicy pastes, rich broths, anything with a strong punch works. Let it simmer for a few minutes and actually soak things up instead of rushing it.

Once I started doing that, shirataki rice stopped feeling like a sad substitute and started feeling useful. It’s chewy, filling, and surprisingly good hot or cold. I use it with veggies, soups, minced meat, and even meal prep. I buy it in bulk now, sometimes through Alibaba, just so I don’t run out. The biggest lesson? Don’t fight what it is.

1pxnse7,Any Tips For Reducing Calories In My Meals?,"I'm trying to lose weight but having a really hard time of it this time around. So I was curious if anyone had any recommendations for me to lower the amount of calories in my dishes without changing the basic taste of the dish.

So, I'm not so much looking for new advice on entirely new dishes (although if you think there's one I might like based on what I'm putting here, you can always recommend it) but more to replace ingredients. Most dishes have spices but I won't mention those. It's also worth saying that I do workouts with weights, so I prefer getting as much portein as possible within the calorie limits.

So, a few of my favorite dishes (normally):

* Omelette with onions, potatoes and chorizo sausage (for flavor).
* Italian chicken stew with chicken, tomato sauce, tomatoes, onions and peppers.
* Chorizo stew with a bit of chorizo sausage, potatoes, spring onions and tomatoes.
* Chicken burito with ground chicken, lime juice, bell peppers, a spicy pepper, red and white onions.
* Sandwich with turkey, lettuce and some melted cheese.
* Toasted sandwich with egg and a ground chicken patty.
* Soup with potatoes, onions and carrots along with a piece of toasted baguette.
* Tagliatelle with a soy-based sauce, chicken, onions and bell peppers.
* Chicken chili with ground chicken, potatoes, bell peppers, onions, spicy peppers, tomatoes and a lot of spieces, of course.
* Pan-roasted chicken with onions, garlic and baked sweet potatoes.
* Creamy meatball fusili with ground chicken balls, a creamy cheese sauce and fusili.
* Spaghetti al assassina with a spicy tomato sauce (no meat).
* Sun dried tomato burger with ground chicken patties, ciabatta bread, red onion, dried tomatoes and feta cheese.
* Chicken burger with a honey-based sauce and onion.
* Honey chili chicken wraps with chicken, fresh tomatoes, lime juice, cilantro, yoghurt based sauce, garlic and honey.

As desserts or snacks I also sometimes eat the following:

* A handful of cashew nuts (unsalted).
* Some peanuts (unsalted).
* Coconut brigadeiro
* And, a bit too often unfortunately, chocolate bars.
* I also love potato chips, but I try to limit those as best I can.
* Plain crackers.

And as you can probably tell a few ingredients I tend to like are:

* Wraps
* Pasta
* Chicken
* Turkey
* Bell peppers
* Other peppers
* Onion
* Potatoes
* Chorizo sausage
* Eggs
* Coconut
* Honey
* Tomatoes (not raw though, only processed into something, I find raw tomatoes too aggressive a flavor)
* Toast
* Carrots
* Bread
* Sweet potatoes
* Garlic
* Many cheeses
* Anything salty or spicy.

I tend to also like Italian and Mexican cuisine in particular. As well as rich, creamy tastes.",1766916021.0,14,15,1200isplenty,weight_loss

leggo's pizza sauce 2tbsp - 30 cal
80g grilled chicken breast with spice rub - 132 cal
some veggies + mushrooms - 30 cal just to be safe, probs more likely around 15 cal

low cal pizza is kind of awesome. for anyone reading this, make sure you put the low fat mozzarella below your veggies so it doesn't get tough and have a worse texture. stays soft and stretchy, super super nice. this is one of my earliest low cal meals, when I make them myself I give myself a larger calorie allowance and put WAY more toppings on. volume is king, and it makes the pizza crust a lot more tolerable

btw, if you have no access to low cal pizza dough - you can make it yourself. 80g low fat greek yoghurt and 70g white flour with 0.5 tbsp baking powder. no need to rise. I put it between two pieces of baking paper and roll it out so I don't need to waste calories on extra flour, then I flash freeze to peel the baking paper off. should be around 300 cal for it :)

Great.

I wake up in the middle of the night with my stomach growling. I am a recovering binge eater, and I suspect the years of binging/purging by starvation have affected my satiety- in this case lack thereof. 

I am proud of myself for not budging the last six weeks of strict calorie counting, as well as not having a single binge episode. I guess I am asking... How do I stop the food noise? Because my quality of life is suffering right now.

1pw86ca,just made pizza under 550 calories possible,"the other night i was making a few pizzas for some friends and got curious... could i make one that actually stays under 550 calories, but still tastes like proper pizza?

so i turned it into a little experiment.

here’s what i ended up doing for this **marinara pizza**:  
about 8g of garlic  
a super-tiny drizzle of olive oil  
around 70ml of tomato sauce  
one pizza dough ball, roughly 240g total: that’s 132g of flour at about **80% hydration** (mix of 00 and a bit of whole wheat)

baked it **neapolitan-style** in a gas oven after a 48h cold fermentation. came out insanely soft inside, light but still with that nice crunch on the edges.  
80% hydration makes the dough super airy, but it’s impossible to mix by hand, a stand mixer is mandatory. still, it gives that open crumb and chewy crust that really makes a difference. also, the higher the hydration, the less the flour, the **less the calories!**  
the 48h fermentation is an interesting plus, makes the pizza super digestible, ideal if you have ibs or just generally struggle with digestion like me lol.

this one landed around 550 kcal, the taste is incredible, and i think i found a big hack here!

Whiz it up then heat it either over the stove of the microwave (though it seems to want to bubble over in the microwave, so be vigilant). 

The banana provides just enough sweetness and also makes it just the right amount of thick to make up for the skim milk. You can add a little cinnamon if it isn't sweet enough. As a bonus, it is a great way to use up old bananas other than making banana bread.

So I had this idea of air frying eggs with rice cakes in mugcake ramekins for some crunchy breakfast bites.

I did some rough cutting, put them in ramekins and added leftover crumbs in. Then I poured in omelette, that was 3 eggs, some chopped onions, spring onions and tomatoes and some random spice.

Put in air fryer for 10 minutes at 200C, look great on outside, but I flipped one and it was not done at the bottom. So I put them back at 160C for 5 more minutes, came out just as I wanted. So right times and temps are somewhere in between I guess, like 180C for 12-13 minutes.

1priqtv,Craving sweets,"I’ve started craving sweets as I transition to “normal life” mode after a super-intense no-cheat-meals-no-alcohol-no-sweets few months in which i walked 15K steps per day, lost 20lbs and tried to keep to 1000-1500 calories/day (I’m 6’3” and now 200lbs).

so I have done the 1200 cal diet twice in the past and have a lot of weight, over 100 pounds.

1pr4wza,~250cal teriyaki shrimp,"1-2 cups riced cauliflower (~25cal per cup)     
1-2 cups stir fry vegetables (~35cal per cup)    
10 shrimp (~100cal)    
for this batch, i made scratch teriyaki with soy sauce, artificial sweetener, powdered ginger and garlic powder, so it's only 10cal per tbsp, if you even want to count it. (i don't for my sanity, lol.)     
extremely easy to make. if you have raw shrimp, you just boil it before adding and nuking. but cooked shrimp means you only have to pop the bowl in the microwave for 4-6 mins, since you can find this stuff in frozen bags.    

the intense flavor of the sauce makes it incredibly satisfying and the sheer volume of vegetables makes it filling.

1pqbgj3,Starving today and then I realized...,"...I'm at day 27 of my cycle.

So I reached my soft goal weight last Friday and suddenly the scale has been up 4lbs this whole week even though I have *absolutely* been in a deficit, have done my hour of cardio every day, and upped the incline on the elliptical from 10 to 15 and the intensity from 8 to 9 or 10.

Did a deep dive and scientifically it all makes sense.  The day before your period is the end of your luteal phase; progesterone is highest and esteogen and serotonin is lowest, and your appetite skyrockets (never noticed this before because I never actually tried to intentionally gauge my moods).  The week before your period, progesterone causes water retention, your sodium sensitivity increases, and your glycogen storage goes up, so you carry 2-6lbs of extra water.  And the increase in incline and intensity in my workouts is causing inflammation around new muscle fibers, holding even more water.

Learning these things has helped me so much not to stress over where I am physically and psychologically right now.  I have not destroyed my progress or willpower.  The biological stars have just aligned for a temporary gain alongside a spike of hunger and this too shall pass.",1766117065.0,233,12,1200isplenty,weight_loss

1pq7fn5,Barebells protein bars 4 count box vs 12 conspiracy,"Okay so idk where the correct* place to post this is so im just going to put this where i see other barebells posts and hopefully I don't make anyone mad. So here we go..

THE 4 COUNT BOXES may not be the same. I dont know what it is exactly. Maybe its the fact that these boxes sit on the shelf for much longer, or maybe they sit in the warehouse longer, or maybe they actually are made slightly differently, but I do not think they are the same as the ones that come in the large 12 count boxes.

 The 12 count boxes being the ones you can purchase whole, or pull out individual bars to buy alone at many stores. In the last 1.5-2 months I have become genuinely obsessed with specifically the barebells cookies and cream bars. And I have noticed something I do not like.

I have bought very very many individual bars at at least 10-15 different stores (from gas stations, to grocery stores, to much bigger stores like target/Walmart, to stores like vitamin shoppe/gnc). Most of them have been great. You can always tell when the bar comes out of a *fresh* box that hasnt sat on the shelf too long because it will be wider/flatter, very soft usually, and absolutely delicious. Then there are the 4 count boxes...

I have purchased several 4 count boxes from the following locations: target, publix, ingles, Kroger, vitamin shoppe, trader joes, and even a gas station that happened to sell them. Here is the extremely unfortunate thing I have noticed- 
         The 4 count boxes, every single one I have purchased, then bars were not as good. All of them ranged from legitimately hard/stiff/firm to somewhat very slightly soft. The flavor was very much affected by this (this* being what I can only assume is staleness or a slightly different method of production). None of them tasted as good as the soft flat individual bars out of a 12 count box. But that isn't the only thing.
         They also are shaped differently and dont have as many crunchy crumble ball things on them. They are not as flat. I dont know if them sitting for a long time and getting stale could make them thicker and not as wide, I would think that would be noticeable in the chocolate coating but it looks fully intact. But they are. They are shaped more like a stick of butter than a wide flat protein bar. And they actually do not have as many crunchy crumble things on top. 

This makes me think that the bars that go into the 4 count boxes are actually made differently because I dont see how getting stale could shapeshift them in this way. There's also the smaller amount of crunchy crumble things. I don't know how sitting in the shelf and getting stale could cause this. 

Has anyone else noticed this? I feel like im losing my mind on some kind of conspiracy but at this point I refuse to ever buy a 4 count box ever again as these differences genuinely make them not as good. The biggest issue being flavor. None of them taste as good. 


Please someone tell me im not insane ... 







EDIT: UPDATE: I emailed Barebells support and they did get back to me. I don't know if I can add a picture to this post so I will copy paste the email directly. 

""Hi (redacted),

Thank you so much for your detailed message and for being such a passionate Barebells fan! We truly appreciate the time and thought you put into explaining your experience—it’s clear you know your Cookies & Cream bars well 😄.


To clarify, the bars in the 4-count boxes and the 12-count boxes are made to the same recipe—they are not manufactured differently. Any differences in size, texture, or appearance can sometimes be influenced by factors like packaging, handling, or storage conditions, but the product itself is the same.


To help our team investigate the issue you’ve noticed with the 4-count boxes, could you please provide the following:

Best before date of the bars

Batch number

Photos of the bars showing the differences

Once we have this information, our team can look into it further to ensure the quality is consistent.


We really appreciate your feedback and your dedication to our Cookies & Cream flavor. Your observations are incredibly valuable and help us maintain the high standard of our products.


Thank you again for reaching out, and we look forward to hearing from you!




Best,

Tyler

Barebells / NOCCO Customer""



Further update: I will have to pull back on my barebells cookies and cream obsession. I completely forgot these bars are full of sugar alcohols because they are the only protein bars ive found where you literally cannot taste it at all. They really cracked the code on proper use of them. However I realized today that eating several of them for breakfast is causing my stomach to fill up with gas enough to temporarily apply enough pressure on my diaphragm to actually cause shortness of breath and significant discomfort. Idk why it took me so long to realize what was causing this but yeah. Its definitely all the sugar alcohols. Still amazing bars though and I likely will still be having at least 1 but I really gotta stop. My wallet hurts too:( 

So PSA to anyone who has GI issues from sugar alcohols, even though it does not taste like it, these bars definitely have them. Beware lads


FINAL UPDATE: I would like to make one last update to report some unfortunate findings. 

Either I was extremely lucky to continuously find good quality bars in the 12ct display boxes in several different stores and gas stations, or these stores are dumping 4ct boxes in to refill their 12ct display boxes (unlikely). I say this because recently I have found very very very many poor quality bars in these 12ct display boxes. Poor quality that drastically changes the flavor for the worse. 

However I still have yet to find any 4ct boxes that aren't the same low quality bars that I keep finding in every single 4ct box. In fact the low quality of 4ct boxes just might be the only thing that is consistent about these bars. Either these places really are recycling the 4cts into the empty display boxes (unlikely) or I really was just extremely lucky for several months in a row. 

Regardless though, consistency and quality control seem to be foreign concepts to Barebells. It is extremely disappointing. Very many of these bars are such lower quality/worse flavor and consistency that it feels morally wrong for them to be the same damn price as the better ones. I've wasted far too much money on shitty bars that aren't nearly worth the price that I think I just might make a commitment to not eating them at all anymore... I was an avid fan and consumer of these for quite some time now but it isn't doing me any good.

Maybe one day Barebells will figure out how to make a consistent product that is of good quality, but until then I think I need to swear myself off of them and stop giving them money that they have not earned. It's a crying fkn shame because they CAN make a good product but just aren't. I feel in love with these bars only to subsequently be met with extreme disappointment and dissatisfaction. A lot of their flavors suck and even the ones that don't are nowhere near consistent at all. You can have two of the same flavor with similar expiration dates that don't taste anything like each other, with one tasting like its worth less than dollar, but both for the same exorbitant price. 

I really hope this company does better and figures out how to make a product that is actually worth the price across the board. Until then I suppose I will clean up my diet and stick to whole foods again, only splurging on foods/snacks of genuine quality.

Im so frustrating.  Every piece of good advice or self improvement available to me i refuse to do for some excuse or another.

I'm a ridiculously picky eater (yes im an adult, and I still gag when I try to eat lettuce) and of course all the foods im adverse to are the good ones. Veggies, meat, Greek yogurt, most protein supplements. 

Im a vegetarian (non-negotiable I cant eat meat w/o feeling sick and spiraling mentally) but I hate vegetables and im too lazy to prepare things like tofu and paneer regularly. 

I cant stand dishes so I have complete aversion to any meal prep or cooking because all I can think about is every dish I'll have to deal with. 

All the protein bars and quick-and-easy fixes ive found that I can actually tolerate are for people in a completely different different income bracket than me.

I hate how I look, how I feel, and I have all the ability to change it but I can only do it for a couple days before im completely exhausted.  Even if I do just one change at a time.

1pn5gmn,Rd. Brownies,"First of all, credit for the recipe goes to user u/boo9817 .

Recipe used:
120g Diet Coke (0 cal)
21g Cocoa Powder (74 cal)
15g PB2 (90 cal) OG has protien powder here.
15g Flour (50 cal)
20g Stevia (0 cal)
1/2 teaspoon Baking Powder (2 cal)
Pinch of Salt (0 cal)

400° F for 10 minutes and then 15 minutes at 350°F for my oven but everyone's oven has their own personality.

My honest thoughts.
1. This recipie is super easy to burn.
2. Ive doubled the baking soda for much more consistent results. It can be cakey but the other option is a fallen kind of brownie brittle.
3. I add 1/2 tsp of cornstarch for a more fudgey bottom. 
4. I poured thin homemade whip cream, a tbsp  of heavy cream and 2 tbsp of low cal creamer mixed with some stevia. I poured it over the brownies and then put it back into the over 350° F for 10 more minutes. Sprinkle with powder sugar. Adds 70 calories for the dish, which brings it to 500 calories.

Total Calories for the whole tin -  210 calories.
I doubled the recipie, it never seems to work out as a single recipie for me, so 420.",1765799467.0,7,2,1200isplenty,weight_loss

1plduul,Built a Subway calorie calculator for custom orders — would love feedback from fellow Subway fans,"Hello guys I’m a solo developer and pretty regular subway eater. I track calories, and I kept running into the same issue that most calorie lists only show preset sandwiches, not what I actually order with custom bread, veggies, sauces, sides, etc.

So, I created this calorie calculator for subway that lets you create a fully customized Subway order and instantly see the calories and nutritional breakdown (macros, etc.). It uses the official Us subway [nutrition chart ](https://www.subway.com/en-us/-/media/northamerica/usa/nutrition/nutritiondocuments/2025/us_nutrition_w4_eng_9-2025.pdf)for calorie and nutritional information. Over time, I cleaned it up and put it online.

I’d really like feedback from you all guys:

* Is anything confusing or missing?
* Does the customization flow feel natural?
* Are there features you’d personally want (saving orders, comparisons, mobile tweaks, etc.)?
* Is the nutrition info layout easy to understand?

This is the subway calculator: [https://subway-calorie-calculator.com/](https://subway-calorie-calculator.com/)

Feel free to recommend anything you like.

I will update every change made here in the [changelog](https://subway-calorie-calculator.com/changelog/).

**Update 14 December 2025**

* Updated the menu with subkrunch on the sides category.
* Added light and normal options for condiments and sauces.

More feedbacks are appreciated I will pay attention to each one of questions or feedback provided.

**Edit: Update 19 December 2025**

The tool is now updated and now contains:

* Updated Menu
* Instant calculations (calculation error fixed)
* Fixed Mobile overlapping.

I have also created a [community](https://www.reddit.com/r/Subwaycalories/) to gain feedback from users, and I will also feature the best reviews and advice on the site and in changelog page that helped the calculator become more helpful for users.

The descriptions and 30s videos are less than helpful. 

Here's what I've managed to decipher from all of the marketing lingo (for just the original ice cream maker--no extra pints containers--and new rather than refurbished):

There's what I think is the original Ice Cream Maker (5-in-1/5 One-Touch programs), comes with two pint containers and I could only find this one refurbished but both were the same price: $170

Then there's the 7-in-1, comes with two pint containers: ~$170-200...this one has two more programs than the 5-in-1 but appears to be less expensive (can be found for the same price as the refurbished 5-in-1)?

Then there's the Deluxe (11-in-1), comes with two pint containers: ~$250

And then there's the Scoop and Swirl Ice Cream and Soft Serve Maker (two pint containers)...this one thoroughly confuses me--it's marketed as something different than the other models but looking at it, it seems to be pretty much the same thing, just with an extra program/function or two? And more expensive: $280

Which one should I get if all I want to do is make tons of cheap, low cal, knock-off Nick's and Halo Top? Are the different ""programs"" worth the extra $$? If you have a Creami, which one do you have and why do you love it (because it seems everyone who has one adores it)? I'm in dire need of some guidance here.  🙏 😭",1765381341.0,10,5,1200isplenty,weight_loss
1pivaz9,Scared for winter break,"I (19f, 5’8, 130 lbs) have lost about 7 - 15 lbs since starting college this year, and I have never felt better about my body, but I would like to continue my weight loss to lose another 5 - 10 lbs. I go home for about a month for winter break next week and I was hoping to have gotten to the 120 lbs mark by then so I could fully enjoy that month and eat all my favorite foods without being worried (in moderation of course). But I’m a week from leaving and still have those 10 lbs to go and there is basically no way to lose them before i go home without immediately gaining it all back. I really was hoping to be able to enjoy my time at home at this new weight, or just be able to enjoy the food. 

Any tips for either:

A: how to continue my progress while still eating happily over the break

B: how to sustainably lose the weight before I leave?

*Info on how I calculate my servings:

For meals like the potato salad, the cauliflower mash, the soup - After I have my first serving, I'll estimate how many servings this dish will be for me. For instance, I've estimated my potato salad will be 5 servings for me, and the mash 3 servings. 

If I have a slightly bigger/smaller serving, I might reflect that in the serving size. Even if it's not 100% accurate, what matters is that by the time the dish is gone, I've logged the whole of it.

For the moussaka, my baking dish is perfectly equivalent to 4 servings for me. Hence 1/4th.

Towards the end I also went back to 1200  for 1-2 weeks. Started noticing super low blood pressure, fatigue, dizziness, and some more hair loss then normal.  Glad I'm not at 1200 now, but I love this subreddit cause I like sharing my low calorie meals in exchange for all of y'alls which is why I'm part of this sub 🙂.

But yeah, my body does not do well on 1200 for longer then a week. I'm 5'4, and am figuring out maintenance at my goal weight of 117 lbs now. Maybe it's cause I don't really have a lot of fat left too lose and so that's why my body crashes so hard when I go on 1200? 🤔🤔 Just guessing. Curious how other people do at this calorie deficit.

Edit: Okay so let me clarify, I never thought 1200 was maintenance. I thought it was clear I wasn't on this low of a deficit when I said ""I'm glad I'm not at 1200 now""  For those of you who are alarmed, yes I know my TDEE, I eat 1600-1800 daily at maintenance, and strength train at the gym and take care of myself.

1pew0b2,Low-carb helped me more than counting,"I first stumbled across this sub when I set out to lose some weight in spring this year because all my pants were too tight T.T, and I wanted to share my weight-loss journey, what worked for me and what did not because maybe someone can relate.

For reference I am 1,67m (I think that is 5'5? I don't speak Imperial, I'm sorry). At the beginning I was 65 kg, now I'm 57 kg. I started out counting calories and trying to stay at 1200-1400 a day. I was not making much progress and my mood was kind of affected. One of my friends pointed out to make sure that I eat enough unsaturated fat because the brain needs it for neuron transmission in the myelin sheaths and cell membranes are also made of lipids. Indeed I had been eating quite little fats because they have a lot of calories so the counting subconsciously made me stay away from them. I had a look at my calorie budget and decided to yeet some carbs in favor of more unsaturated fats.

This worked amazingly. I'm basically eating a low-carb diet now, but without all the crazy bacon and high-fat cheese in every meal. Basically I eat a lot of vegetables, replaced most of my bread, pasta and rice with cauliflower (don't judge me okay, it comes frozen in bags and is so easy to cook) and make sure I eat enough protein so my body does not metabolize my muscles. In terms of fats intake, I prioritize unsaturated fats, these are the ones your body needs. Good sources are fish, lean chicken, avocado, nuts and vegetable oils. I avoid cheese except for mozzarella and cottage, and fatty meats. 

I'm very happy with this. It's easy (for me) to follow and I'm not hungry. I actually stopped counting calories and just eat until I'm full, hence the title. My life has become so much simpler and I stopped worrying about gaining again.",1764943755.0,25,22,1200isplenty,weight_loss

1pdvmeo,Gluten-Free Lentil Bread,"A person asked for my lentil bread recipe and I decided to share it in a post, in case anyone is in a similar situation to mine, and might find it useful.
 
This lentil bread is Gluten-Free & has a fair amount of protein and fiber. I didn't invent the recipe but there are a lot of variations and I wanted to share my insights on this one.

- 250g of red lentils soaked overnight and drained
- 2 eggs
- 2tbsp/12g of olive oil (you can try adding another)
- 1tbsp/8g of baking powder
- ~1 tsp salt
- 150g greek yogurt/skyr. I used 2% yogurt.

Processed in a blender until smooth.

Most recipes call for 40-45 minutes in the oven at a preheated 180°C. 

My oven sucks and I ended up with a dense, flat bread. My second try I did 200°C for an hour and it was perfect. So bake it at your own discretion. My tip is: Use a toothpick to test when it's done. Make sure the toothpick comes out nearly if not completely dry.

The lentil bread is soft and pleasant. I'm not too into the bread just by itself, it has a kind of strong flavor. However, enjoyed as a sandwich, toast, or with soup it is really good. The texture is so much like regular bread, it surprised me, for something that's technically a savory lentil cake. I really like it toasted. I like it so much that I don't intend on trying any other recipes soon, lol.

Even though it's pretty fluffy & soft, it is Very Filling. Not something you can stuff yourself with like white bread (although the texture is most like white bread IMO). Thinner slices seem to serve it best. It slices very easily & well. It's really great toasted!

*Pictured: The lentil bread with homemade hummus, feta cheese & seasoned salt on top. I added those pictures as a visual to show how the nutritional information reflects in a serving.

(*also, the grams of saturated/unsaturated fat might not be accurate because a lot of the products I track don't have that information in my app for some reason, and I don't care enough about it.)",1764840157.0,27,13,1200isplenty,weight_loss

Small breakfast salad 209C
- 1 avocado (133C); 1 tomato (31C); some feta (45C)



Black rice & Cauliflower mash 305C
- 252g of black rice with veggies & chickpeas (236C); 150g of cauliflower mash (69C)



Soup & Bread 454C
(this was just a very big portion hence the high calories lol)
- 535ml sweet potato lentil soup (257C); 101g of lentil bread (197C)



I cook everything in big batches - I track everything I put in the pan/blender, then weigh the final dish (usually by balancing the whole pan over a cup on my kitchen scale & subtracting the weight of the pan lmao) and calculate the nutritional information per 100g.

Other times, if I know something will be exactly 2 servings for me, I'll just split the calories in two. (like the chicken with my cabbage)

hi!! I’ve been counting calories for a little under two months I think? I’ve lost only 12lbs and don’t feel a difference in my mood or see one in my appearance. 

I think a big part of this is because I haven’t cut any of the foods I love out of my diet, I eat chocolate, bread with more than 5 ingredients, burgers and fries, tacos, enchiladas, pizza, donuts, etc etc. I mostly stay within 1.2k calories, occasionally I’ll get to 1.3k since I’ve only stopped my snacking & portion control. 

I am wholly awful at making grocery lists of things I want to eat to become more healthy, because my mind blanks every single time. Even when I do eat healthy food i tend to make it unhealthy. I had squash the other day and drowned it in melted cheese and fried tomatoes.

1p5zzez,What are some life long habits you will carry with you after you’ve reached your goal weight?,"Hello guys! I’ve been on this subreddit since around late April-early May, and with the new year coming up soon, I also have some new goals for myself. I’ve been eating average 1200 calories a month for the past 6 and a half months, and I’ve dropped down from 163 lbs to 117 lbs. I am 4 pounds away from my goal weight and so, I’ve already planned out some of the habits I will carry into the new year to maintain my goal weight. I will list them below.

1. Eating two meals and 2 snacks a day: Before I had even lost weight, I had no concept of “meals.” What actually made me gain weight was the fact that I would just consistently eat throughout the day. I’d occasionally have breakfast on the weekends, and I would eat out (fast food) a lot, but I used to consider food from drive thrus as “snacks” rather than meals. Now that I have a pattern that works for me (Brunch between 11-12, Dinner between 6-7, snack in between, snack at night) it works really well for me and my body adjusted to only eating during those times in the day. Today’s meals for example: Brunch was a low calorie everything bagel with whipped cream cheese, turkey pistrami, blueberries and a zero sugar iced coffee, midday snack was a protein bar and a clementine, dinner was rice, chicken, and yogurt. Snack 2 (aka dessert) was Breyers carb smart chocolate ice cream with sprinkles 

2. Buying low calorie foods: Obviously, many low calorie foods are out of budget for the average person, like why are low calorie bagels 8 dollars man!!!?? But there are some things that will become an absolute staple in my house. For example, olive oil spray, which is a must for me now. I think part of the reason I gained so much weight was because of butters and oils, so I’d rather use spray. Another would be Live Light toast, which is basically just thin toast for 40 calories a slice. It’s much cheaper than keto bread which is usually a half loaf for 6 bucks. Live Light toast is the same price as regular toast so it won’t make or break my grocery budget. Almond milk is another great one because I actually just really like almond milk, for some reason I only like my own almond milk tho, the stuff in the cafes is kind of buns, so I’ll probably just get whole milk at cafes only lol 

3. Eating until fullness: I used to be a big volume eater when I started my weight loss journey, because the amount of food on my plate was something I needed to visually see to feel full. As I lost weight, I started to slowly shrink my portions and make up the calories for those parts that I’m shrinking by adding something a little more calorie dense (80/20 beef, avocado, etc) to my plate. That way it was the same calories, same nutrients, but I was slowly training myself to get used to eating smaller portions. Since I’ve done this, I can go to a restaurant or cafe or wherever, and since their portions are usually larger, I just eat until I am content, and put the rest in a to go box. It works well for me because I changed my mindset around food from “I have to finish this all now” to “the food will be here later.” This was something I had to unlearn from my childhood, as I was always forced to finish my plates, which gave me terrible eating habits. 

This post was kind of a mouthful, but I’d love to hear some of the habits you guys keep up with at your goal weight! 🫶",1764035528.0,75,11,1200isplenty,weight_loss

1p5halb,"🍫 35-Cal Chocolate Banana Cake (556 kcal total - 16 slices) Low-Cal, Moist, Fudgy, and Delicious!","Hey everyone! I wanted to share a low-cal chocolate cake recipe that I’ve been working on for a while.

When I first got into low-calorie baking, I tried several recipes online… and honestly, I was disappointed a few times, mostly because erythritol amounts were way too high, which affects both texture and taste.

After some trial and error, I found the best combo is to use lower amounts of erythritol + a few drops of liquid stevia and taste the batter before baking to adjust sweetness.

I’ve made this recipe multiple times now and it’s delicious, low-cal, and definitely satisfies sweet cravings.

Ingredients (calories are per amount needed)

	•	2 medium eggs → 136 kcal
	•	35 g egg whites → 18 kcal
	•	80 g banana (mashed) → 72 kcal
	•	85 g thick yogurt → 55 kcal
	•	38 g flour → 138 kcal
	•	30 g unsweetened cocoa powder → 114 kcal
	•	5 g cornstarch → 18 kcal
	•	4.5 g baking powder → 5 kcal
	•	30 g erythritol + liquid stevia to taste → 0 kcal
	•	1/2 tsp instant coffee → 0 kcal
	•	Pinch of salt → 0 kcal
	•	A few drops vanilla extract or zero-calorie vanilla syrup → ~1 kcal

Instructions

Step 1 – Whip the eggs + sweeteners
	•	Crack 2 eggs into a bowl + 35 g egg white
	•	Mix 3–4 minutes with a hand mixer until pale and fluffy

Step 2 – Add wet ingredients
	•	Mix in yogurt, mashed banana, and vanilla extract

Step 3 – Add dry ingredients
	•	Sift in flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt
	•	Mix again

Step 4 – Add cocoa–coffee paste
	•	Mix 30 g cocoa powder + 1 tsp instant coffee + a little hot water into a paste
	•	Stir into the batter

Step 5 – Bake
	•	Pour into a 24–25 cm square pan (≈9.5–10 in)
	•	Bake at 180°C / 356°F for 12–14 min

Step 6 – Cool + Slice
	•	Let cool for minimum 30 min – 1 hour before slicing 
	•	Store in a container in the fridge (the cake tastes even better the next day!)

Optional: I usually add 1 teaspoon of low-cal cream cheese frosting I make (chocolate or vanilla, ~11 kcal per teaspoon) to each slice before eating as I wouldn’t recommend frosting the whole cake if you don’t plan to eat it all the same day. The cake is delicious cold, but you can also microwave a slice for 20 seconds before adding frosting for a slightly warm version.

I’ve added a few pictures of the whole process if you’re interested. I hope you enjoy if you try it ☺️

1p5e70z,1 pound 300 calorie oatmeal,"EDIT: this has been a really controversial post 😂😂😭😭 But just allow me to say YOU DONT HAVE TO REFRIGERATE IT... IM NOT MAKING YOU, OKAY... YOU CAN JUST EAT THE WARM OATMEAL... I just like to have my pudding. some of you are very angry. Ok😭 I like my pudding 🍮 

I love oats & I'm constantly trying new combinations & cooking methods, and this is the recipe I'm currently obsessed with

This oatmeal is kind of like a combination between classic oatmeal & pudding. Personally I like this the most with no solid add-ins

If you refrigerate it overnight, the next morning you can turn it over and have it like a pudding! Choose the amount of liquid based on how thick you want it. I love it both hot & cold!

blend together: 
30g oats;
10g pudding powder (~100% cornstarch (e.g. Dr oetker) flavor of choice);
15g protein powder (I have vanilla soy isolate);
5g psyllium husk;
sweetener to taste (I use erythritol);

(+whatever else you want to add. I've done: cocoa powder, vanilla, cinnamon, ground ginger, xmas spice blend, banana...)

Add to:
200-250ml milk (I use soy);
200-250ml water;
Ratio & amount is up to you, depending on how much volume you want. I usually do about 450ml liquid total

Cook at low-medium for a bit to let the dry & wet ingredients incorporate, and then switch to high heat to properly cook the oats and activate the cornstarch, stirring constantly. you'll know it's done when it's become thick and pudding-like, and when it isn't getting any thicker.

There might be some small lumps, you can try to avoid it by sifting the dry ingredients or leaving the oats for longer at low-medium on the stove; but honestly, they're not unpleasant.

The psyllium husk gives it a slightly ""jelly"" texture, but it isn't overwhelming and I think it works very well with the cornstarch.

A few days ago I bought a carton of AE (Iowa brand) milknog. It's half eggnog, half milk, which sounded good because the taste of eggnog is a bit strong for my liking.

Thanks to this, my dumbass **JUST** realized that the reason I like this stuff and the Shatto whole milk isn't because of the flavor, but because of the *texture.*

We're a 2% milk family, and I rarely drink it. That said, I've read that it can supposedly be better for hydration than plain water, and I'm at higher risk of dehydration due to medical factors. I drink a *ton* throughout the day, and luckily the things I drink regularly are 0 calorie drinks... Milk is not that, especially whole milk, which Shatto has shown me I can very quickly down.

Are there any whole milk alternatives, or something lower cal of a similarly appealing texture? I figure that I could possibly fill up on something like that to avoid other snacking if anything exists, which could be especially beneficial.",1763967770.0,0,4,1200isplenty,weight_loss

1p4010m,Fellow office workers trying to lose weight— need help with my eating schedule,"So I’ve been successful in losing weight through a calorie deficit—- until I started my first office job a month ago. The main factor at play here is that my eating schedule has been completely thrown off. So I’m looking for some advice on what others in this position are doing! 

My schedule before: 
- Wake up 8:00-9:00, latte when I wake up. 
- Savory breakfast at 11:00-12:00 
- Lunch at 1:00-3:00 
- Dinner at 5:00 

My new job is 7:00-3:30, so I wake up at 4:30AM (get ready, workout, and commute). I have my latte when I get to work at 7:00. Breakfast is the first problem. Ideally I would eat at 9:00-10:00, but I feel guilty bringing my microwaved bacon/potato/egg white bowl into the tiny room I share with other employees. Sweet breakfasts like a yogurt bowl are off the table too since they set me up for cravings later. I also cannot wait until my lunch break at 12:00 for breakfast, mainly because I’m very hungry immediately after waking up, and this would mean not eating for ~8 hours after waking up. 

At 12:00 I have my lunch, and then dinner is at 4:30-5:00 when I get home. So far this plan hasn’t been working, I’ve been snacking during the day after my lunch, and then snacking after dinner. Would appreciate any advice people have for making this work!",1763835104.0,3,7,1200isplenty,weight_loss

I believe her now. I could legitimately eat my weight in Taco Bell and be uncomfortably, *painfully* full and my brain is still shaking me by the shoulders and screaming that I am going to fucking implode if I don't eat more food. I can confirm this because I did eat about $35 at a combination KFC and Taco Bell. Still felt hungry after.

Also, I work at a bakery and a grocery store deli, so on weekends I clock into my bakery shift where I'm constantly offered leftover cookies, scones, muffins, and cinnamon rolls, given a free shift meal (yay for my bank account but almost everything we serve is calorically dense cuz yum), and then I clock into the deli where I cook pizzas and grill sandwiches that I can't eat because I probably met my calorie limit from breakfast and lunch earlier, then I have to turn down the chicken nuggets, pizza slices, meatball subs, and deli salads that are offered to all the employees at the end of the night. I feel like I'm constantly surrounded by food that I'm starving for but I literally can't eat it. AND if I eat it anyways, it's not even going to satisfy the hunger because I'm taking these pills that make me feel like a ravenous beast 24/7.

Take out 52g frozen chopped plain spinach, any brand. (26g per 1/2 serving.)
Evenly distribute the spinach across the bread.

Place in oven and bake for about 5-7 minutes depending on how golden you like the bread.

Optional: serve with a side of tomato sauce or marinara to dip or dollop on top. Your low calorie choice of preference! (Calories not included, lol).

I had started to plateau so it was a good opportunity for a reset. I gained back 3lb but I'm ok with that considering I can't walk.

Started back to it this week, its day 3 and all I can think about is my next meal. Any advice to kick the cravings?

Will post today's meals properly later but so far I've had 
- apple and yoghurt for breakfast
- veggie omelette and parsnip soup for lunch
Thats total 450kcal.

1p10oyp,Help!,"I been religious at sticking to an average 1200 to 1250 for nearly 6 weeks. Felt great, more energetic, lost 10lbs.

I even did a little more exercise per week. I even found myself after awhile struggling to eat 1200 cuz I’d get full around 800-1000 calories. I’d still eat my 1200, cuz PROTEIN! lol Also, any excuse to use my extra calories to have a snack or beverage is fun. :)

This week? 👎🏼
I swear, I stayed in my calorie range Friday but I used a lot of calories on adult bevys. Saturday I focused on recovery and ate nearly 400 calories more, but I walked more to try to balance it out.

Sunday, back on track. Yesterday and today? Almost another 400 calories again!

I feel hungry, and I really think Friday messed me up. Got my electrolytes and metabolism out of whack and my body in mineral/vitamin depletion.

Idk what to do. Saturday I drank electrolyte water that is naturally 0kcal, had 118g of protein, 184g whole food carbs, 31g fiber, 13g poly and monounsaturated fat, even 10g saturated fat. Enough sodium, vitamin C, potassium, iron.

Today I had 87g protein, 195g carbs, 45g fat…Calcium was 115% of Daily Value and my other micronutrients were pretty good too.

But my exercise and walking isn’t enough to “net” the excess I am eating.

What can I do to help my body reset itself for the rest of this week? I’d ideally like to eat a true 1200 again and not feel starving, or at the very least eat a “net” 1200 with enough exercise.

1p0y07w,I Did a Taste Taste On Selected Premier Protein Shakes,"I've been eyeballing the Premier Protein shakes, and I saw so many flavors they had to offer. So, I decided to try and rank the Premier Protein flavors that were available to me - the ones I thought I’d actually enjoy. This is my first time trying the Premier Protein products, and I ranked them based on my personal taste preference. Overall, the whole product has no aftertaste and does not taste ""chalky"". It had a resemblance to milk with flavor added to it. I tried each product at room temperature.



**Cafe Latte**

This is my personal favorite, and I think it would go well with coffee. It has a subtle coffee flavor.

**Caramel**

Caramel was similar to coffee for me, so that's why I would rank it second. It is a tad bit sweet, but if you like the extra sweetness, I think this would be a great pick.

**Vanilla**

Basically tasted like vanilla milk. I am a vanilla guy, so I did enjoy it.

**Strawberry and Cream**

This flavor wasn't bad, but I did wish it had a bit of a stronger ""strawberry"" flavor. To me, the strawberry flavor felt like it was in the ""background"". It's not overwhelming. But it was better than the lower-ranking flavors.

**Cookie Dough**

Taste similar to any ""cookie dough"" flavor, but a bit sweet for me. The cookie dough flavor is just a hint and nothing more. I also thought it had a subtle ""Caramel"" flavor profile in it.

**Cake Batter Delight**

This flavor is essentially a blend of vanilla and artificial cake. Not a big fan of the artificial cake flavor.

**White Chocolate Raspberry**

I wasn't really tasting a ""white chocolate"" flavor in this. The Raspberry is a background flavor, so it's not overwhelming. I did wish the Raspberry flavor had a stronger flavor profile. To me, this combination felt more like a Vanilla and Raspberry mix rather than ""White Chocolate"".

**Cinamon Roll**

This flavor nailed the cinnamon roll ""glaze"" aspect. But the cinnamon spice is a bit too much for me to want to drink this repeatedly. I don't think it would be bad as an additive to a recipe.

**Root Beer**

Eh. Maybe with vanilla ice cream, and if the drink was cold? Otherwise, it just tastes like a melted root beer float.

**Winter Mint Chocolate**

I have never been a big fan of mint. So, no surprise that I didn't like it that much, but since it's a limited edition, I was curious to try it anyway. Taste just like melted mint chocolate that has been diluted with milk.

**Cookie and Cream**

This was just awful. I did not like this guy at all. Which surprised me because I generally like cookie and cream flavor. This tastes like the worst version of the ""Cookie Dough"" flavor without a good cookie flavor. Normally, I'd expect a ""cookie and cream"" flavor to have that Oreo flavor for the cookie, but I wasn't tasting that. It just tastes like a weird cream protein shake. If you want a cookie-flavored protein shake, I would stick with the ""Cookie Dough"" flavor.

Let me know which flavor you think is best! I definitely think some of these flavors would go great in recipes or as an additive to a drink, and a few select ones are good by themselves.

1p0inpt,345cal lunch with a cool ingredient,"My coach is actually slowly bringing my calories up and I’m finally on 1450 a day as opposed to 1200 that I was on for the last 4 weeks but I still find this sub super useful for recipes and ideas. So, today I wanted to share something quite unique. If you live near an Eastern European supermarket, check out if they have wafer sheets. Wafer sheets are generally used as a shortcut for easy no-bake desserts, cakes, or even savoury appetizers. They are neutral in flavour and crispy. Once you spread some filling over them, they get soft, so you end up with some delicious cakes. I’ve used them before with pastry cream, cream cheese frosting, or even tuna salad for savoury cakes.

Anyway, here I have one Wafer Sheet which is 78 calories. On top of it there’s a sort of tuna salad made with drained tuna, quark (softer and lower calories version of cottage cheese with the same protein), scrambled egg whites, wilted spinach, and a tiny bit of salsa. Wafer gets softer after a few minutes and you need to roll it, almost like tortilla,  so if you like crispy base, you can just break a few pieces of the wafer and use them as chips to scoop out the tuna salad or whatever else is your filling.

It’s not the most common or easy to find ingredient, but it’s massive (my hand is there to show the size) and relatively low calorie.

I’ve tested it in the past, but as soon as I stop exercising, if I eat at 1500-1700 a day, I just gain weight. Yet I see video’s of Asian women (who are also short) and work out all the time who claim they get to eat 3000 cals and still maintain their physique.

1ozmxas,Why is there so much judgement/sabotage from family and friends?,"Like a lot of you, I am 5'2"" and fine-boned/petite. A child can get their fingers around my wrists. I am currently down 20 pounds since my last child was born, but I've been struggling with some extra weight. I am probably about 3-5 lbs from being a ""healthy"" weight according to BMI and I fluctuate into and out of ""slightly overweight."" I have re-committed to do my best to get into more of the middle of the ""healthy"" BMI range. This has been backed up and recommended by my doctor.

However, I find I can't talk about it with anyone because everyone is highly judgemental. Most people where I live are overweight, and many friends and family would likely qualify as medically obese. I don't comment on their eating or choices, but I get a lot of comments and side-eyeing of mine. I would be rich if I had a dollar every time I heard ""What is your problem, you are already so skinny!?"" I'm literally just trying to be medically healthy, and they take it as a personal judgement of their very being. Some will even bring food around that is tempting and high-calorie, or try to push me into going to get fast food with them, even after I just ate my last meal of the day. I also have family that openly turn up their nose at my food because it has things like beans, vegetables they don't recognize, ethnic foods, etc.

Do you all deal with this too? I try not to talk about my calories or goals to combat this issue, but sometimes it's clear I'm cutting when we are in public or with family/friends and it's noticed. How do you handle this? And why is there so much negativity?

I add half a serving of glass noodles (100) cals, but you can easily omit that.

1ow7svk,Advice about getting back into it - 2 years later and struggling,"TW: Postpartum depression, mental health, weight gain and unhealthy habits.

TLDR; advice about getting back into healthy eating mindset after 2 years of bad habits and mental health struggles?

Hi there lovely people.

About 5 years ago, I went from 200+ lbs (I’m a 5’3” female for reference) and prediabetic with PCOS, to 140 with prediabetes and PCOS completely in remission. My periods came back, my blood sugar stabilized, and I felt fricking *amazing*. I was a success story, I had energy, and for the first time in my life I felt healthy. I had all but defeated the fat logic, food noise, and binge eating that completely dominated my life previously. Life was good.

Enter getting pregnant, and having my son. I had a lot of mental health issues during and after my pregnancy, and as you can imagine, restricted eating fell to the wayside. But pregnancy wasn’t the actual descent. I gained about 15 lbs net after I delivered my son, which was perfectly acceptable, but within the 2 years remaining I just kept gaining weight and getting into worse and worse habits. Now I’m 187, exhibiting prediabetic glucose levels, and feeling depressed about it and completely unmotivated to get back onto the health train.

PPD/PPA is a beast and grace should be given of course, but after this long with my MH relatively stabilized and symptoms mostly abated, I know it’s time to put a focus on my health. I just can’t seem to do it. I want so badly to get back on my health journey even if it is just a little at a time, but I can’t seem to motivate myself. I feel so weak to my urges and I’m just spiraling into worse and worse eating. I feel like shit about myself. 

Does anyone have any advice about getting back onto the train of healthy lifestyle when they can’t seem to find the motivation or energy? My declining health should be putting a sense of urgency in me as it did before, but for some reason I just can’t do it like I did before. 

Thanks for reading and I appreciate y’all.",1763056244.0,2,4,1200isplenty,weight_loss

I just told Chat what ingredients I had on hand and it whipped this up.  Only change I made was doubling its recommendation for the crust and adding like a teaspoon of lemon juice to the batter.

The recipe made three of these li'l cheesecakes in my 4-inch springform pans.  Each one is 361 calories, 20.7g fat, 11
3g fiber, and 25.6g protein (before toppings).

*****

For crust:

.5 cup Fiber Gourmet flour

2 tbsp Challenge Avocado Oil butter

2 tbsp nonsugar sweetener

For batter:

1 cup lowfat Good Culture cottage cheese

8oz reduced fat cream cheese 

6 tbsp egg whites 

1 egg

1 tsp vanilla

1 packet sugar free cheesecake pudding mix

*****

Preheat oven to 325°.  Melt your butter (I love  Challenge Sea Salt Spreadable Butter with Avocado Oil, 80cal per 14g tablespoon, but you can use light butter for even fewer) and mis in your flour and sweetener (Fiber Gourmet flour is half the calories of regular so it's my preferred flour).  Pat it into the bottom of your springform pan(s) and cook for 10-15min until sides brown a bit.

In a food processor, blend your cottage cheese smooth.  Add your egg and egg whites (or all egg whites to reduce calories further), vanilla, SF pudding mix, softened cream cheese, and optional lemon juice/extra sweetener if desired.  Blend and pour over cooled crust.

I cooked my 3 springforms for about 33 minutes, then turned off my oven, cracked the door, and let them set for another 20 before moving them to the fridge to chill overnight.

I froze one and the other two have been eaten with sugar-free jam and raspberries.  I think the third one is gonna get bananas and whipped cream.  I'll DEFINITELY be making these again, but I might do like a 2:1 ratio of cottage cheese to Greek yogurt only because I feel like the cottage cheese is a touch umami/salty--not bad by any means, but the yogurt would tame it a bit without adding too much of that fermented tang yogurt's got going on normally!",1762993117.0,108,14,1200isplenty,weight_loss

1oulhn4,Has anyone gone 8-12 months on 1200 without weighing themselves?,"I started at 165lb 3 weeks ago, been eating 1200cals with no problem. I'm starting to feel a difference in how I look but even if I saw 155 on the scale, I wouldn't feel much better about my BMI. And if, more likely, I'm only 162lb, I'd feel discouraged and kind of upset. 

I don't think scale emotionality is unique to me, so I'm curious if anyone has dealt with this by simply not weighing themselves at all for the entirety of their plan. Losertown says it'll take 15 months to reach 105; personal anecdotes suggest 8 months; I'd like to go this whole journey without weighing myself at all. It also somewhat motivates me to want the eventual weigh-in day to be the lowest it could possibly be and see a huge drop- so don't screw it up with a 2000+ binge any time before then. Alternatively, if I do have a fun day and eat 2000+, I don't want to feel pressured to weigh myself the day after and feel the shock of a 5lb gain from water, food, etc.

I feel like daily weigh-ins after each day of 1200 looking for a .3 or 1lb reduction are building on short term gratification and the dieting mindset that you can lose measurable fat in just one day or a week of a cal deficit, when it's actually a very long term, complex bodily process over 3+ months. 

  
Plus, I never want to deal with the psychological torment of a plateau. I've never dealt with one in my life, I'd like to keep it that way lol— just keep me blissfully unaware and trucking on with 1200.",1762895077.0,28,81,1200isplenty,weight_loss

While everyone else was eating greasy takeout or cold leftovers, I'd have a fresh hot meal! I've also made this in my hotel or Airbnb while traveling. 

I use a flexible formula:

* 1 serving plant protein, sliced (I usually use extra firm tofu or rehydrated dried soy protein slices)
* 1/2 small onion or 1/4 large onion, thinly sliced (essential for flavor, won't taste good without it)
* 1 large or 2 small tomatoes, diced
* 1 serving of mushrooms (whatever's available, today I happened to have some fresh cordyceps but usually it's shiitake or oyster mushrooms)
* as much chopped cabbage as you can fit in the bowl/container (use force to squash it in, it will shrink down to 1/3 its original volume when cooked)

For flavoring I use soy sauce, vinegar, black pepper, and a dash of good-quality sesame oil. I used to pre-mix my seasoning and have it in a convenient little bottle in the office fridge. When I'm at home I'll chop a little fresh cilantro or green onion to finish it off. 

So savory and satisfying! ",1762781492.0,51,0,1200isplenty,weight_loss

Ok i was making this turkey soup for my work lunches and decided to have some and share here for insperation, the only thing i would change for the next time i make this is add a bag of mixed veg (12 or 16 oz whatever i have ) for more greens but it still tasted great 

this meal was 

1 8 oz serving of turkey stew (made 3 pound servings for work and then split 1 pound between me and my neice, so this was 202 calories)  
2 slices frozen garlic bread (280 cals )   
1 pepsi zero (o calories) 

lunch is 482 calories today seems i need to increase my calories for dinner tonight since im still way under 

the recipe is 1614 calories per pot and you can make 1 pound portions for about 4 portions and with rounding up thats about 404 calors per 1 pound before sides) 

1 pound ground turkey ( i used the festive brand frozen chubs you get at walmart and fried with cooking spray ) 800 cals  
17 oz of cut russet potatos (google didnt help so im going with higher count of 460 calories)  
1 can of great value slice carrots (70 calories for the can)  
1 28oz can of petite diced tomatoes in tomato juice (175 cals)   
2 knorr vegetable boullion cubes (60 cals for 2 cubes)  
1 cup dried diced onion (didnt have fresh and taking high end of the 49 calories for a cup)  
3 cups water (for the boullion cubes you make it before you drop into pot)  
and 1 tablespoon of each worchester sauce, badia roasted garlic powder, oragano, parseley, and season salt

how to cook 

brown and cook turkey in pan and get it nice and broken apart  
add meat, drained carrots, onions, potatoes, and tomatoes to pot, this si also where i added the dryer ingrediant and sauce, then i added the broth ontop and stired heavy before locking the lid on my instapot and used the stew function this is a little dryer than an instapot likes so i cooked it half way till it shut off then i switch to slow cook for 45 minutes  
  
over all a nice meal what you all think

Just wanted to share my diet, nothing crazy really, I'm sure it could be optimized, but it makes me happy, and the best diet is the one you'll eat (or something like that)

Monday-Friday is the same thing every time

6am- a cup of nonfat milk with a packet of chocolate breakfast essentials, loads of good stuff and 220 calories!

12pm- I cook for my buddy and I forgot work, and I'm a sucker for Chinese, so I do general tso chicken and pork fried rice! A cup of rice and some air fried chicken with a bit of sauce, and it comes out to 650 calories!

6pm- Ahi tuna steak salad! I throw in 3 cups of greens, an apple, and a seared tuna steak, it comes out to 240 calories and 29 grams of protein. 

Snack after supper- No Man's Land Beef Jerky! 17 grams of protein and 70 calories a serving (and honestly I usually only have a piece when I'm feeling peckish) it holds me over just fine.

On the weekends, I straight up just have breakfast. 6 Protein pancakes, 4 slices of applewood smoked bacon, 4 eggs, and 1/4 cup of grits. Comes out to just under 1200 a day.

1oq2nm9,To all my fellow konjac lovers: what are your favorite recipes?,"Disclaimer, I know konjac noodles/rice/etc. is a very divisive topic. It seems that people either love it or hate it (both regarding the taste and also the way their stomach reacts to it). But I'm asking mainly people who do like it.

My favorite (albeit pretty simple) recipe is:

1. Pan fry (with oil spray) some pieces of chicken (seasoned with salt and pepper should be enough). Once it's cooked to your liking, put aside.
2. Rinse your konjac noodles in water and toss them for a few minutes in the pan (reusing the pan = less dishes to wash lol). You don't need oil, just the heat.
3. Add a few drops of Buldak hot sauce and stir until combined well. It's quite spicy, so start with a little and add more depending on your tolerance.
4. Put the noodles in a bowl and top with the chicken and maybe some spring onions.

It tastes almost exactly like real noodles, it's really tasty. The only thing stopping me from eating it everyday is that I don't wanna get bored of it lol.

I recently got a bunch of konjac ""pasta"" (tagliatelle, lasagna sheets, etc.) for really cheap since the store was closing, so I'm wondering how to prepare them. I know traditional pasta recipes often don't translate well to cooking with konjac, so if anyone has recommendations (especially for the lasagna sheets!), I'm all ears!",1762444586.0,20,10,1200isplenty,weight_loss

You can sort by protein %, grams of protein per $ and a few others options.  You can also filter by item category (protein bars, pantry staples, snacks), allergies, and effort required (can you just heat it up or does it require preparation).

I'm literally so happy I can eat a good amount of it and not break the calorie bank so thanks to you guys for always sharing your low calorie foods ❤️

1ooty4o,A way to reduce calories in peanut butter??,"Lemme take y'all through a scientific experiment I recently conducted (in my home kitchen) 😛 

My **research question** is *to what extent the calories in all natural peanut butter can be reduced by removing its oil content.* I **hypothesized** that *the calories in peanut butter can be significantly reduced via removal of its oil content, as the caloric count of peanuts is up to 49% fat* (Arnarson, 2024). Our **materials** include a fresh 750g jar of Great Value's Crunchy Natural Peanut Butter, and some measuring spoons. 

As for our **procedure**, I first let the jar sit at room temperature overnight to encourage the seperation of oil and peanut bits. When morning came, I then skimmed off the layer of oil on top with a spoon, successfully removing about 2 tbsps of pure peanut oil. 

To **analyze** the caloric reduction, I first obtained the mass of 2 tbsps of removed peanut oil, which was about 25 grams and 238 calories (no academic source, sorry 😔). This leaves 750g – 25g = 725g of peanut butter left in the jar. According to the Great Value nutrition facts, a serving size of 15g is 90 calories. In a 725g jar, there are 725g ÷ 15g = 48 servings. Therefore, the caloric reduction per serving is 90 – (238 ÷ 48) = 85 calories. The removal of 2 tbsps of oil from a 750g jar of peanut butter results in less than a 6% reduction in calories per serving. *Thus, we can* **conclude** *that skimming the oil off a jar of natural peanut butter is only effective in reducing its calories to a highly minimal extent.*

Thank you for listening to my Ted Talk. If a longer read didn't bore y'all, I would have found the p-value and pulled out the t-distribution table too 😛 for future research, I would propose heating the peanut butter to further encourage oil seperation, to expand the sample size, as well as to use a food scale for better accuracy. And if you're really, really adamant about finding out the caloric reduction, I would even suggest setting up a homemade calorimeter. ",1762318387.0,53,44,1200isplenty,weight_loss

1ooixah,"Advice for visiting a friend who eats a lot more for several days? Sticking close enough to my plans, especially without offending her? :'(","I'm planning on visiting my childhood friend soon, for around 5 or more days. She's basically like a cousin to me. My family ate a lot of junk food growing up, and so did hers. But I've been turning things around for the last year, which has been really hard, and I don't do great every day. Now my typical calorie plans per day range from around 1,200-1800. (If I'm on vacation, I guess I don't mind having around 2,000 on some of those days especially if we do some active things). I love her a lot for who she is, and her family, I just cannot handle eating like 2,500-4,000+ calories in a day anymore.

First of all, I *really* don't want to bother her, make her uncomfortable, trigger, offend, or *come off as really annoying* if she sees me tracking my food or weighing things.. (I probably shouldn't weigh anything around her because people who aren't used to that might see that as disordered or ridiculous). I would hate to do anything that made her feel more self-conscious or uncomfortable. So any advice on that? 

Secondly, any advice on enjoying a vacation without falling into the many temptations? Or being able to ""indulge"" a little without going overboard? If I had to guess, she probably likes sweet treats several times a day, and all the other delicious and calorie dense comfort foods life has to offer. Pretty big weaknesses for me :( Any tips, tricks, or encouragement would be great. Any methods or ideas? We are planning on me either staying at her house for like 5-7 days or going on a road trip. Do I just take one for the team and eat a little bit more while I'm with her and then go back to my new normal afterwards? ",1762289466.0,31,45,1200isplenty,weight_loss

Something that I do that works for me is I go to the grocery store over the weekend and I buy shelf stable food and I put it into these Ziploc gallon bags. And then every day, I open a bag, and that's all of the food that I eat during that day. 

For some reason my dumb brain accepts the logic of ""because it's in the bag for today we can and we will eat it today'' and this actually reduces basically all my anxiety about eating, and actually makes me feel positive and excited about eating.

1onvjuj,rice calories???,"im a huge fan of rice, but ever since trying to lose weight I’ve avoided it like the plague, because for the life of me I can’t figure out how to track the cal’s. Maybe im just slow or overthinking this too much. I use YAZIO as my calorie tracking app. 

My family buys “Royal Basmati Rice”, this big 20 pound sack of uncooked rice, it’s delicious but I don’t know how to calculate the calories for, let’s say, one cup of COOKED rice.

The bag says that 1/4 cup is 160 cal, and im assuming that’s reffering to the raw rice. 

But on the cooking instructions, it says 1 cup (of uncooked rice) yields 3 cups cooked, and is 4 servings. Does that mean 3/4 cup of cooked rice is 160 cal?? Does that mean 1/4 cup uncooked makes 3/4 cups cooked? Im not a dumbass but im unbearably anxious about not knowing the calories of what i eat. I don’t wanna have to make one singular serving every time i want rice, we usually make white rice in big portions, and I just want some peace of mind when im eating rice.

1on1apm,Isn’t it bizarre that there’s seemingly no restaurants dedicated to low-calorie versions of normal food?,"I find it honestly bizarre that there’s no restaurant built entirely around making foods low-calorie, not “healthy,” not “clean,” just low in calories, using techniques that thousands of people online already know work.

Think about it: we have endless fast-food chains serving 800–1,200 calorie meals, and we have “healthy” spots like Sweetgreen and CAVA that sell salads and grain bowls. But there’s almost nothing in between, no place that says, *“Here’s your favorite comfort food, same taste, same portion, but half or a third of the calories.”*

That’s insane, because the techniques already exist and have been proven over and over. You can make a burger, cookie, or even ice cream that tastes nearly identical to the original with 60–70% fewer calories. A Dairy Queen Blizzard can be 900 calories, but people using a Ninja Creami at home make versions that are 300 calories or less that taste just as good. You can air-fry fries, replace sugar with Splenda or allulose, use lean meat or protein milk, etc. None of this is rocket science anymore.

And yet…, AFAIK, no restaurant has done it. You would expect at least one niche spot in a big city to focus on this, but after digging pretty hard I still could not find a single restaurant built around it.

No chain has said, *“We’re going to make the exact same foods you love, but engineered for calorie efficiency.”*

Not “vegan,” not “organic,” not “healthy lifestyle,” just the same junk food, but lighter. Imagine a menu that markets itself like this:

 

\> “Same Oreo Blizzard. 900 → 300 calories.”

\> “Same cheeseburger. 1,000 → 350.”

\> “Same fries. 500 → 150.”

 

People want this. Everyone who’s ever tried to lose weight knows that calories are what matter, not buzzwords. It’s not about “diet food.” It’s about enjoying the same food for fewer calories.

It just seems like a massive gap in the market waiting for someone to fill it

1qahfbc,26.5 Hrs to Go (72 First Timer) and Refeed Questions,"Skip to the bottom of the post if you don't care about the backstory:

So, long story short, I had a very unhealthy 2025 due to life stress and going overboard with fast food, eating out at restaurants, smoking, and boozing. I gained about 30-40 lbs and currently sit at 180 lbs, 5'10, age 39. I kicked smoking in December, giving up booze for 100 days after starting on New Year's Day.

I'm no stranger to diets, exercise, CICO, nutrition, etc. and have weighed as low as 125 lbs in adulthood but comfortably live around 140-150.

Due to a change in medications, I am trying to lower cholesterol, get assorted blood levels into normal range, repair my liver a bit - especially since the meds are harder on the liver, improve gut and heart health. Weight loss is secondary, and will come just by CICO, healthier eating, excercise, and cutting out booze for a while. I've done OMAD before a few times, without knowing IF was a thing, mainly out of convenience.

I stumbled upon the 72 hour fasting thing because a YouTuber I follow brought up the 72 hour reset and became intrigued about flushing out damaged cells and so on. 

Im doing a water only fast, but I think I've got this in the bag - 26.5 hours to go. The hunger ebbs and flows but sea salt + 0 cal electrolytes, on top of an insane amount of water helps.

This Part:

So now I have questions about the refeed and breaking the fast tomorrow. I know what foods to go for, but should I be aiming for TDEE when I break the fast tomorrow or more? Or just gently nibble on stuff to see how that goes? Also, if I eat something processed/not exactly healthy for a meal on Tuesday, will that screw me? Or should I wait a few days/weeks after breaking the fast? More or less for a cheat meal (meal, not an entire day).

I currently use intermittent fasting as a tool to put myself in a calorie deficit for the day since it seems like I’m not very hungry during the day when my adhd meds are running and have trouble going to sleep at night if I’m hungry, so eating close to bed works for me.

I usually take my adhd meds right on waking up and then wait an hour or so after to drink either a low calorie soda and/or decaf coffee to assist with the hunger suppression and so they don‘t interact with my meds.

I have noticed that it ends up being pretty inconsistent since some mornings-to-afternoons I’m not hungry until MUCH later and other days, I’m hungry so shortly after.

I sometimes eat a small snack with the coffee/soda since I’ve heard that can help with less rebound hunger later.

1q98kh8,First night trying to do IF and I genuinely felt like I needed calories after my fast time was supposed to start at night - should I ease in?,"Hey all! So I’ve been working out for the first time in a long time, going hard and it’s been feeling AMAZING. I heard about IF and downloaded an app that guides you through it.

Last night I really genuinely felt like I needed calories, in a very very healthy way if that makes sense. I’m a pretty big guy and I can tell the difference if I’m bored or if I’m craving sugar or something similar. I would have been incredibly happy to eat carrots and hummus last night lol 

Does my body kind of need to get used to fasting at first? Maybe it’s because I’m a bigger guy or likely because I’ve been suddenly burning a lot of extra calories recently (I started about 5 days ago doing weight training and doing light treadmill too)

Overall I’m feeling SOOO much better and I’m really excited because I feel like I have such a better sense of how many calories I need (in a kind of feeling it my body way), and even 5 days of going to the gym has totally changed how I feel - even if I haven’t lost literally any weight, the amount of energy and the difference in my mobility is huge. 

Also just wanted to share in general early successes with this stuff :) I’m ready to be healthier and have that be part of my identity that I’m a person who goes to the gym and is active. ",1768062828.0,3,12,intermittentfasting,weight_loss

-body recomp can take years 
-even if I can’t see changes, changes are happening on a cellular level. 
-my period is scheduled to arrive this week and my weight always balloons before my period. 

I’m not frustrated enough to jump off the wagon. I KNOW I’ve made progress. I’m making smaller goals, so right now I’m motivated to just get my body fat under 30%.

1q8929b,IF success- quieting the food noise,"**Hi**!

I’ve been hanging out in this sub since I decided to give IF a serious try in May. I had dabbled before but nothing long-term.

I'm 36F, about 5'9.5"" starting around 191lbs.  
I was struggling seriously with what I have learned is called ""food noise"" probably my whole life but it had got significantly worse over the last few years. I had been on and off tracking calories strictly since 2021 post the birth of my son. I gained quite a bit during my pregnancy and did a pretty solid job of coming down from 245lbs (i cried often after getting over 200lbs) to around 180lbs by 2024. Over the course of a year with life and stress my weight crept back up to that 191 lbs. To say i was always thinking about food and my next meal, just barely covers it. I was very concerned about calories but was feeling so burnt out of tracking, measuring everything to a T. Meal prepping and packing my lunch for work was a huge source of frustration. I felt that I spent countless hours on meal prepping and it was so draining. Combined with heavy anxiety and depression symptoms I made some changes, got on some new medication early 2025 and started IF in May of last year.

It has made huge difference in my mindset about food. And the food noise felt like it immediately disappeared. Something clicked in my brain with IF, like I literally only have to think about food between a certain pre-determined amount of time each day. There is no obsessing, there has been no binging, I feel full and satisfied after meals. I've even had instances in my eating window where I find I can wait cause I think for the first time. I haven't been tracking calories during my eating windows and likely never well as that was a serious source of issues for me mentally. However, I've had some awesome success, Im down to pre-baby, pre-pandemic weight and feel healthy and fit. My first goal weight was 162lbs, which I hit in November. I hadn't really thought about going lower until recently, in my adult life I don't think i've been less than that. I might try for 155lbs and am currently sitting around 159lbs give or take as I'm a mensurating female who also really really enjoys working out regularly with my kettlebell! So I anticipate swings.

Anyhow, things I've done during this time.. When starting I worked up to two 36hr fasts a week. Typically fasting 16-20hrs the other days, one normal weekend day of eating. I have two young kids and usually save my eating window for family dinners at home. I've stayed flexible, not always hitting 36hrs twice a week, and now that I'm closer to were I want to be I will be swapping to 36hrs twice a month and 18 - 24 hr eating window the rest, keeping my flexible eating on the weekends. I workout, and have for years and love to. Minimum 30 minutes walking, but do everything from mobility to cardio to strength. I'm not a purists and use SF sweetener in my coffee with a dash of whipping cream, I suck on jolly ranchers occasionally, sometimes sip bone broth, and enjoy flavoring my water with zero calorie additions. Somewhere in this group someone recommended the app Happy Scale, which I love. Gives some solid perspective on the weight fluctuations that have helped.

  
Anyway, reading successes on here has helped me, so wanted to do the same in case it helped anyone else!!   
Cheers!

1q7d6v2,How does intermittent fasting help blood sugar,"I’ve been doing personal research on various topics but one I’m wondering is intermittent fasting particularly in how it helps blood sugar. 

Im aware that when you fast you give insulin more time to come down. But when you eat in a shorter window and are eating the same amount of food, wouldn’t that just create a larger spike and a higher blood sugar overall during the feeding window? I know it can improve insulin sensitivity which would offset some of what I’m wondering, but it really can be that much? 

For example 2000 calorie diet and 16:8
16 hour fast so insulin gets low, then you eat your calories in an 8 hour window. Say you eat 4 meals, a meal every 2 hours or 2-3 meals but much larger in caloric size. You’re going to spike blood sugar and keep it high by eating every 2 hours, it won’t get a chance to come down until you’re well into your fasted state after your last meal. 

2000 calorie diet on an average eating schedule 
You eat 4 to maybe even 6 meals a day since you have more time. Smaller in overall caloric size, but more times in a day. 

Why would one be better than the other? With fasting wouldn’t you increase your overall sugar level during the feeding window (1 big spike then continuous smaller spikes and less time for blood sugar to come down before next meal) and then with an average time eating wouldn’t you have larger spikes but more time for sugar to come down in between meals (4-6 larger spikes, but sugar would come down and be lower because of more time between the meals)? 

Maybe I’m missing something. Hopefully I put my thoughts into words correctly lol ",1767882485.0,0,39,intermittentfasting,weight_loss

So I bought a walking pad, and did 5k steps during my off days. But then before the holidays I started stressing a lot ( christmas is not a nice time in my family), I stalled, then christmas and new years arrived and lots and lots of foods. Weight went back up to my original weight. 
I got a Fitbit for christmas and started using it the day after. After christmas I decided to do 8000k steps a day everyday. Weight went back down a bit and then New years eve, lots of food. Weight went back up and I haven't been able to fast since then. I counted calories but all the food noise I struggled with my whole life is back.

1q6vk2i,Finally in my groove! And five lbs down over the last ten days.,"I’m finally finding the best time for me to eat is around 1-2p and stopping by 3. Today I actually wasn’t hungry yet but wanted to stick to my routine. Had chicken salad with a side of Greek yogurt and pb2. I was satisfied and closed my eating window, without feeling like I wanted to eat the whole kitchen. 

I get super hungry right before bed but then just go to sleep and when I wake up, I’m about 16 or so hours in and feeling great! My goal the next ten days is sticking to this eating window and hopefully another 4 or so pounds down. Should be manageable if I’m not flip flopping back and forth lol.

What's confusing me is why the heck i dont get hungry? Something wrong or is my body used to now IF i been doing for past 4 months if not more?

Both 24 hr fasting days didn't feel hunger. I am doing i guess 16:8 daily IF.
I am doing for autophagy benefits and maybe fat loss if that happens. Am 185 lbs was way over 220 two years back. I also make sure i get 10k or more steps in daily.

1q67rrr,How bad is it to regularly break fast for a coffee?,"Hi!  I've been wanting to start intermittent fasting for a while and have been trying it out for a month now, though a bit loosely where I let myself break it it's a special day (with the holidays there wasn't much else I could do!).

I'm doing a 16:8 schedule, and my fast ends at 2pm (it's the best way to work with my life schedule).   But I still drink one cup of coffee in the morning, around 9am.  I initially just thought it's a small enough (milk worth about 20 calories), and regular enough bit of food that it wouldn't really mess me up in any way, and as far as I can tell I've been fine- I don't feel hungry much outside of my fasting period at all.  In that way my fasting period is sort of more like 11 hours, one cup of coffee, 5 hours, and then freedom for 8 hours.

However, I'm sort of worried that it's messing something up internally?  I'm not completely sure about how IF works outside of just helping you limit how much you eat by limiting when you eat and controlling your hunger.  Would having a cup of coffee in the morning in any way negatively impact my weight loss?  Am I functionally doing a 11:13 fast, and breaking the fast in the morning makes the rest of my fasting until 2pm worthless?

I'm also not feeling any of the other wonderful effects that everyone talks about. I haven't lost any inches so I'm not converting fat to muscle or anything like that. I fast between 8 PM-12PM. It works best for me to skip breakfast so that I can eat with the rest of my family in the evenings.

I've been very strict with the fasting, no cheating. Drinking plenty of water. I exercise 6 days a week (did before, nothing new) during my fasting window. I have not been eating any more than I did before I started fasting during my eating window, and have been trying to prioritize protein. My diet is pretty healthy, though I do enjoy dessert (again, not adding any calories compared to normal routine). I snack only occasionally. If I cut a third of my calories and wasn't gaining weight before this ( at a pretty steady weight for a year or so before this), shouldn't I lose *some?*

  
Before someone comes at me and tells me I'm still overeating, I'm not ""overweight"" according to my doctor. However, I am not at the point I've been at before where I was feeling my healthiest. I have a pretty physical job and I am fairly confident I'm in a calorie deficit. 

I'm also not feeling the energy and clear-headedness that all of my acquaintances that have tried IF rave about. I'm **exhausted.**

I am 36/F. I do have chronic Lyme disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. My lyme is well managed right now, my thyroid as far as typical numbers (T3, T4, TSH) go is well-regulated but my antibodies remain high, have been for years.

**Current IF setup**

* Schedule: 16:8
* Fasting window: \~9pm–1pm
* Eating window: 1pm–9pm
* Meal timing:
   * 1pm – lunch
   * 4–5pm – protein bar
   * 7:30pm – dinner

**What I usually eat (typical day)**

* Lunch (1pm): avocado and tuna sandwich with some fruits
* Snack (4–5pm): protein bar
* Dinner (7:30pm): chicken breast, veggies, and lentils

I don’t snack outside of that, and I drink water and black coffee only.

**Activity / exercise**

* Mostly sedentary outside the gym (desk / low activity day).
* I work out 5–6 days per week at the gym, switching between cardio days and weight lifting days.

**History with IF**

* I’ve been back on 16:8 consistently for about 4 months now.
* Before this, I did IF for about 2 years straight as well.
* Despite all that time, my weight basically hasn’t moved in any meaningful way.

**Tracking / medical context**

* I don’t track calories (I’ve only ever had rough estimates suggested to me; I’ve never logged seriously).
* Meds: I’m on antidepressants and cholesterol medication, which I know *can* sometimes affect weight, but I’m not sure how much that explains things.

**How it feels**  
It’s frustrating because on paper it feels like I’m “doing the right things” – fasting, eating what seems like reasonable meals, and working out most days – but I’m not seeing results on the scale. It’s starting to mess with my head a bit and I’d rather know what I’m missing than keep spinning my wheels.

**What I’m asking you all**

1. Looking at my routine, what are the likely reasons I’m not losing weight?
2. If you were me, what would you change *first*:
   * start tracking calories?
   * adjust meal composition/portion sizes?
   * change the fasting window / length?
   * change my workouts?
3. For those who were in a similar boat (doing IF but not losing), what finally made the difference for you?

I’m not looking for a magic fix – I just want some honest, practical feedback from people who’ve been through this. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to reply.",1767723609.0,18,118,intermittentfasting,weight_loss

1q5l8iy,Back on IF 💪,"After six+ months well and truly off the wagon I got back into IF and healthy eating beginning of December. Even through the festive period I maintained 16/8, one or two days dropping to 14/10 or 12/12 for flexibility as well were visiting family, but I always did at least some IF and successfully resisted a grey deal of sweets/chocolates, alcohol etc (a few treats I of course allowed haha).

I even did my first ever 36 hour fast, tying it into a stretch of night shifts which definitely made it easier. I felt fantastic by the end, could have easily kept going, but had succeeded and was excited to break my fast mindfully.

However, this is where inexperience caught up with me 😅 My refeed was way too fast, way too much, and way too much fibre for my microbiome at the time. I suffered, a lot 😅 Severe bloating, constipation, very slow transit, mild stomach pain and heartburn... this lasted a good 2 weeks over Christmas (which helped with my good behaviour tbh haha, too full to eat much!). I saw the GP just to confirm nothing more sinister, but the correlation was obvious.

I'm pleased to say though that I've come out the other side in the last few days, bloating/gurgling after eating is vastly reduced, BM back to normal and healthier than before. I've maintained my fibre intake throughout, tempering with OTC meds to control stomach acid/gassiness/constipation, and am easing off these now. I can eat high fibre with no real issues, which is a huge win even if I did go about it the wrong way 😅

My cravings for sugar, refined carbs, processed foods, pastries et al are next to non-existent (and have been for several weeks really). I know crave whole foods: nuts, fruit, veg, lean protein, eggs... I can walk into Greggs (for any UK IFers lol) and order a black coffee, look at the pastries while waiting and not feel a thing... utter indifference 🙂

In about a month I've dropped 6 lbs, which I'm super happy with, and I feel generally so much better other than the bloating issues, and those have settled. Better mood, better energy, less fatigue even with weird shift patterns (sleep can still be difficult at times, but that's a lifelong issue), better satiety with smaller portions, etc.

It says to ease into it with shorter fasts at first, but I just jumped right in and went straight for 18 hour ones. Does anyone (especially) women have practical experience or advice on this?

1q4nhui,My New Year's Reset Fast,"I always try to do a 'reset' fast after the xmas/new year week, and usually that's at least a full three days, typically aim for 90h, but this year I got on a roll, and by the evening of day 2 I was feeling great, ketosis was ramping up, and I knew i was going to extend it. Honestly the best I've ever felt when fasting, and I ended up breaking my fast this morning at just past 180 hours, or 7½ days, from Sunday evening through to Monday morning.

First the obligatory big tick!

[180h Completed on Zero](https://preview.redd.it/ry3j22zejjbg1.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=aeb25d6fda079dcd4eef3556779700f19ae279c9)

  
Through the fast I was checking my bloods every 12h at 9:30 am / pm every day through the week, and here's how the blood sugar / ketones looked.

Not sure what's with the lower dip on thursday, maybe just an anomaly, but clearly by the evening of day 3 I was already in a high level of ketosis, and after 5 days it was rising rapidly.

I felt amazing by the end of the fast.  Energy levels were amazing and mental clarity absolute on point.   Really, really happy I listened to my intuition and carried on through the week.

I'm definitely going to do this again, and will aim for a 7-day fast annually in future, in addition to my usual routine, obviously.

Oh, and of course, I lost some weight too!

The starting weight there is a bit artificially high, blame the xmas/new year excess and fluid retention.  Prior to xmas week I was around 184, but in real terms I lost about 5lb over the week, which wasn't the real goal, but it sure was a nice bonus.

So, if I'm focusing on just one meal a day to boost insulin sensitivity, what happens if I throw in a couple of low GI meals in between? I mean, they could keep my energy steady and help avoid those crashes, right?

At some point I was very strong and a lot less heavy, I could haul my ass around like it was nothing, but gradually as I lost more weight it seemed like all my muscle mass was gone. My forearms had gotten definitely smaller, my ass cheeks could barely hold my pyjamas in place and I was a lot more loose in my clothes. But more importantly, I was a lot less strong. I work into delivery and sometimes people order heavy stuff like disc brakes or treadmills and I found myself struggling more and more to do my job. I sort of got in a depression so my very thin routine of lifting weights once or twice a week or having a walk every few weekend kind of got tossed aside until I figured things out in my life. Then slowly autumn came around and I was FREEZING from barely the slightest fresh morning.

1q44o3f,Advice on Refeed Window Adjustments 18:6 Currently,"I (F29) have been practicing IF since june 2025. I have went from 147lbs down to 127lbs but am stuck. I recently did a lot of research into WHY im stuck at this weight for the past 2 months despite lowering my caloric intake GREATLY. I believe i have been under eating for  the majority of my IF journey (under 1000 cals per day). My current regime is 18:6 but it turns more into 20:4 during the work week.

My TDEE is between 1750-1850 calories per day. My estimated calories per day to lose steady weight is 1400-1500 per day. I found this out by reading through posts here, chat gpt and my fitness pal. That said here is my problem.... I physically can not manage that many calories during my window (work makes it impossible) and on the weekends im simply not hungry and do not want to force feed myself just to hit a number.

My idea to help this: loosen thr reigns on a my strict eating window. What I mean by this is if im still under 1000 calories by the time my window is closing going ahead and eating nutrious snacks to boost me over 1000 despite my window being closed for the day. Is this going ti have negative draw backs? Will all the progress I've made be lost because im not strictly fasting for 18+ hours a day? Or will this be an acceptable thing to do to nudge myself back into weight loss since I believe i have plateaued due to under eating/lack of nutrients?

 Yesterday, I made a bunch of French onion soup and a batch of chocolate chip cookies (prepped some stuff first thing so I didn’t have to spend all day cooking for the family). Saturday was a “free day” where I wasn’t focused on fasting, since I’m getting back into it and just wanted to listen to my body. Mid morning I had a bowl of soup for breakfast and half a cookie (random, I know lol). 

Around 2pm I had another bowl of soup, and a decent sized salad.  (I know it’s not many calories,  but I have plenty to lose, and was fine). Then I just thought hmm, what if I let that be it for the day? I was satisfied, so gave it a whirl. 

Around 8-10pm I was mentally hungry but physically fine. I went into the kitchen probably a dozen times but didn’t get anything other than a couple glasses of water. I kept looking at my fasting app, and I swear it was counting backwards lol. The struggle was so real. I was SO READY to eat but took my butt to sleep instead. I really didn’t want to have to restart, knowing sleep would easily add another 8+ hours until I had to think about food again.

Tried tracking on MyFitnessPal again yesterday and almost immediately felt miserable. Just as I had the umpteen times I’d tried it before.

Decided to jettison that and try intermittent fasting.

I’d got down to 194 lb in summer, largely through walking a lot and having breakfast very late…it was essentially intermittent fasting that I was doing, but I hadn’t been systematic about it.

I decided to approach intermittent fasting with some discipline. I began my fast on 3rd Jan at 7.45 pm. 

For strength and cardiovascular fitness, I’m going to do a resistance bands workout every other day, alternating the workouts with running. I’ll add some dumbbell and barbell work to the workout days as I make progress.

My goal weight is 165 lb. I’d like to reach that by summer. If I lose 1.5 lb per week on average, I’ll be down to my goal weight about three weeks after the summer solstice. It seems reasonable, so here goes.

I’m determined to make this happen. I’ve struggled with my weight for a few years now, having been on an antidepressant that caused my appetite to run wild (I also developed a sweet tooth that I hadn’t had prior to going on that medication). I changed to a different medication a year ago and the bingeing stopped.

The lowest I weighed was 89 kg earlier this year, when I did loose IF and treadmill running in prep for an operation earlier this year. Otherwise my weight has been fairly stable around that 95kg figure the last few years. Prior to the pandemic I weighed about 100kg, and had done most of my adult life, but thankfully it hasn't gone up to that since 2020.

I started IF again this week, but there's a couple of things I find difficult. One is eating out. I've had a couple of social things this week, and they have meant eating during my fasting window. Second is getting hungry late at night. Last night I couldn't sleep for cravings. I held out for ages, but eventually got up and had some bran flakes and semi skimmed milk. This doesn't feel terrible in the grand scheme of things, but is definitely not fasting.

but i’ve not been paying insane attention to what i eat. i look at random high protein meals online and then make them. but are we going to see any results doing so? i feel we are essentially in a calorie deficit and preventing nighttime snacking (stopped eating our nightly strawberry special K bowls of cereal, which i miss sooo much)

i noticed the comments on the posts in this sub all say they break their fast with eggs, a handful of nuts, and like a fruit. 

we break with like a chicken wrap on low cal tortillas.

1q1vxgs,2025 Fasting Review and Goals for 2026.,"I have been fasting for many years now, started tracking my eating windows every day in 2023.

In 2025 my goal was to improve my consistency as I have previously had more peaks and valleys than I would have liked.

**Fasting** 

* Fast for 16 Hours or More 95% of the time (Achieved 96.7%)
* Fast for 20 Horus or More 30% of the time (Achieved 28.5%)
* Complete 4 Multi Day Fasts (Ended up Doing 5)
* Fast 90% of the time Every Month (Achieved 11/12 Months)
   * Might give myself a chop out here, as I travelled in December for Christmas and still got to 87%) 

**Workouts**

I didn't have any weight loss goals but I do track my workouts. In a cute coincidence, in 2024 I exercised 276 times, and then in 2025 I did exactly 276 again.

* This is just over 5 workouts per week which I think is reasonable to maintain over long periods.
* My 2025 mix shifted away from Cardio and towards Weights, and I am measurably stronger now than last year.
* Looking at the data, I basically gave up on BJJ over the last few years after getting promoted in belts, I want to correct that this year.

**Misc**

* I was creatively productive 76 Days, up from 29 in 2024
   * Completed my book manuscript (about data lol)
   * Completed all illustrations for the book
   * Started developing a video game
* I took my supplement stack 345 Days, up from 158 in 2024
   * Honestly frustrated with myself that this wasn't 365.
   * Sometimes I would just totally forget? 
* I avoided all pharmaceutical products the entire year (365 of 365 Days) 
   * Really proud of this one - I wasn't sick once, had no allergies, no pain that required relief - hoping to continue this for as long as I can.
   * This isn't about any phobia or resistance to Pharma products, but is more an indicator that I'm healthy and not injured. Take your meds if you need to.

**2026 Goals**  
I see no reason to change my fasting goals and I'm just going to roll on again

* 95% days fasting 16 hours or more
   * 90% every month
* 30% days fasting 20 hours or more
* 4 Multi Day Fasts (one per quarter or so)

In terms of workouts, I'd like to maintain the volume but do a mix shift. Maybe less lifting, more BJJ

* Average 5+ Workouts per week every quarter
* 52 or More BJJ sessions
   * This is very achievable, and would represent a 60% increase from this year. But once a week feels almost too low. I'm hoping to do much more that this.
* Cardio... Don't know.
   * I think I'll do less Cardio sessions (biking or swimming) because of the increased Jiu Jitsu volume. 

In terms of other goals

* Create 'vertical slice' of Video Game that is playable by somebody other than me
* Avoid all pharmaceutical products if possible
* Improve % of days that I don't eat 'processed' foods. 
   * I measured this in 2025 for a baseline - so in 2026 I want to improve.

1q1ghgt,Lost 23kg via OMAD and again via water fasting,"While I was actively prepping for a power lifting competition in 2020, I started eating one meal a day of about 1500 calories and training at the gym 15 hours a week. I managed to lose 23kg in about 2 months, droping to 89kg and lifting 257.5kg at the competition - gained a lot of strength even though the caloric restriction.

5 years later, I somehow found myself at 120kg after focusing more on work. 
- Wearing shoes and cutting my toenails was a chore
- My sleep quality suffered and I had to get a sleep apnea machine.
- I could not jog 200m without my shins feeling like they would explode. This was especially sad as I used to run 100m in 10.98s at university. 

Inspired by Steven bartlett's guests, I decided to try the water fasting trend!

I was amazed at the results and how easy it was. I was scared that id be hungry all the time but to my surprise after day 3, the hunger disappeared and I literally forgot about the concept of hunger.

In the first 22.5 days I dropped from 120 to 104kg. I took a break and started again about 18 days ago and I dropped to 96kg. That is **24kg gone in 40 days!!**
I hope to carry on for another 4 weeks, perhaps Ill be able to hit my goal of 80kg by then

Already,
- my sleep Apnea is effectively cured
- I have more mental clarity
- I have more time to work and build my business instead of thinking about what I'm going to eat and how to get it
- I have saved some money
- I'm finaly able to wear all my favorite clothes.

This is just a temporary thing to quickly get me out of a mental and physical health danger zone. once im done, ill jump back to OMAD for consistency.

With these results possible naturally, im not sure why anyone would use Ozempic.

1q1c9g9,Don’t Give Up: My Cholesterol Finally Dropped After 18 Months - Patience Pays Off,"I wanted to share my journey because I see a lot of people getting discouraged when they don’t see immediate results in all their health markers.

I started intermittent fasting in June 2024, combined with regular workouts, extended fasts, and eating healthy. By November, I’d lost 40+ pounds and hit my goal weight. My HbA1c dropped from 5.8 to 5.3 between my June 2024 and October 2024 bloodwork, which was huge for me and one of my main goals.

But here’s the thing - my cholesterol didn’t budge at all. Not in October 2024, not in April 2025, not even in July 2025. I kept doing everything right, but those numbers stayed stubbornly high. It was frustrating, but I stuck with it.

Today (January 2026) I got my latest bloodwork back, and my cholesterol FINALLY came down to the normal range. That’s 18 months after I started this journey.

Research shows that cholesterol can take 4-12 weeks to several months to respond to lifestyle changes, and some studies show it can take even longer for significant improvements. Weight loss and intermittent fasting do improve lipid profiles, but the timeline varies for everyone.

So if you’re doing everything right but your cholesterol isn’t moving yet, don’t be discouraged. Keep going. Your body might just need more time. The changes ARE happening, even if you can’t see them in every blood test right away.

I’m excited to start the new year on a positive note! Looking forward to another year of IF-ing!",1767294770.0,50,21,intermittentfasting,weight_loss

A bit about myself: 40 years old, a bit overweight (6'1 240lbs) and am definitely not athletic by any means. I started 10k steps a day about 6 months ago and lost quite a bit of weight (down from 300lbs). About 2 months ago I started to eat like crap again and stopped my daily walking. To help get myself back on track, I decided to go for the 18/6 program about 3 weeks ago. Honestly, the weight has fallen back off super fast and am now close to where I was before my old urges got ahold of me again.

  
I've never really tracked my heart rate. My blood pressure is 'normal' and I feel OK (other than a little tired).. but am concerned because my resting heart rate for the past week or so has been in the high 40s (48-52). No dizzy spells or fainting going on.

  
Of course Google is freaking me out and saying Bradycardia can be caused by a ""failing heart"" -\_-

45F 5’8 Started June 9th at 245 pounds. Averaged 20:4 for the first 4 months. High protein/veggies. Low carbs. Worked out 5 days a week cardio and strength training. Hit my goal weight of 195 on October 1st.

Cut back to 16:8 after reaching my goal and have still loss an additional 10 pounds. Currently at 185. 

New goals are to have my eating window stop at 6:30 at least 5 days a week. Which will help with my next goal which is to improve my sleep quality. Next is to build more muscle, reduce body fat and improve my swimming( took beginner lessons Feb of this year).

Pics are of the start of my swimming journey and one from a couple days ago where I wore my first real athletic swim suit to swim laps as my new form of exercise! 😁🙌🏾🏊🏾‍♀️

Thank you to this Sub for giving me the inspiration I needed to keep me going through this journey!! It Can Be Done! 💪🏾

1q0cmc7,"A Complete Newbie, I'm Currently on the 57th Hour of a Water-Only Fast. Please Review my Approach and Advice on Next Steps","Background: I'm 27M, 6'2"", 140kgs. 
Medical condition: Autoimmune Hypothyroidism.

I gained a lot of kilos over the last 3 years due to eating all my meals outside (I moved cities for my first job), having a slow metabolism and having a lot of late night meals. Since the last 2-3 months, I cut all of that down, fixed my lifestyle as much as I could and tried my hand at 16:8 fasting. However, I could never maintain consistency with that and did not see much gains. 

I have an event coming up next month and I need to be in the best possible shape for that. My diet has been less than 1500cal per day for the last few months, I've cut down on sugar and have been consuming a lot of greens and proteins already, so I just decided to buckle up and go on a huge intermittent water fast (something like 9 Day Fast - 5 Day Refeed and so on).

I'm on the 3rd day of my first water fast. Surprisingly I've faced no issues. I've had, besides water, 2 espresso shots on days 1 and 2 and 1 cup of green tea on day 3. Surprisingly, I've not faced any physical weakness. I've been able to work normally, have walked 8k steps on all 3 days, and haven't really faced mental cravings a lot too till now. 

I've added a pinch of salt to my water glass twice or thrice a day. 

Is a 9 Day Fast : 5 Day Refeed approach actually viable? Or should I cut it short and do something like 72h fast or even 48h fast once a week and eat normally (or in a 14:10 or 16:8 window) over the rest of days?

I’ve been doing 18:6 (Two Meals a Day) for about 8 months now, mostly 4–5 days a week. I’m happy to report that I’ve lost 20 pounds so far! However, I’ve hit a bit of a mental wall and could use some advice from people who live alone or have high-stress jobs.

**The Situation:** I live away from my family during the week for work and travel back to them on weekends. Because I’m with family, weekends usually become ""cheat days"" (though I try to watch my sugar). My real struggle is during the week when I’m alone.

**The Problem:** When I close my laptop after a long day of work, the cravings hit hard. Living alone makes it worse. the house is quiet, and I find myself craving sugary snacks or fried food as a ""reward"" for the workday.

Even though I try to stay disciplined, I find myself giving in once or twice a week—and the worst part is, I’m eating this junk **during my fasting window**. I end up feeling a huge amount of guilt afterward, worrying that I’m undoing all my health progress and messing up my insulin levels.

**My Questions:**

1. For those who live alone, how do you handle the ""post-work"" urge to binge or eat junk?
2. How do you stay focused when your willpower is low after a long day of meetings/desk work?
3. Any tips for transitioning from ""Work Mode"" to ""Fasting Mode"" without using food as a bridge?

I know I’ve made progress (20lbs down!), but I want to stop this cycle of ""junk food guilt."" I’d love to hear any ""hacks"" or routine changes that worked for you.

Thanks in advance!

1q02u0k,Support group,"Hi ladies! 💛

Almost two years ago, I started a small WhatsApp group for women who fast — and it turned into such a motivating, supportive space. It really helped with accountability, and we had a lot of fun along the way too.

Over time, though, people moved on from fasting or got busy with life, and the group slowly went quiet. I’ve realised how much that sense of community actually mattered to me, so I’d love to try again — this time with a smaller, more committed group.

What I’m offering: 
•A supportive, positive, non-judgmental space
•Accountability and challenges 
•Joint fasting sessions or, if unable, the best hypewoman out there 
•Sharing tips around fasting, health, and fitness

Who I’m looking for: 
•Women 30+ 
•People for whom fasting is more of a lifestyle, not a short-term weight-loss tool 
•Those who are happy to check in regularly and stay engaged — even if they fall off the wagon (read: don’t disappear for days on end)

I want to keep this group small and close-knit, so please only join if you genuinely enjoy fasting (with flexibility!) and are happy to stay active in the chat even during breaks.

If this sounds like you, message me! Happy holidays 🎄✨

Edit: I got many requests, thanks for the interest! But like I said, I wanted a small group (5-6 people) which I have now! Sorry to those I didn’t add but feel free to make your own group!",1767152465.0,36,25,intermittentfasting,weight_loss
1q00h9j,"151 fasts, 25 lbs down and no more prediabetes!","TLDR: 42f/5 ft/193.8 lbs to 168.8 lbs in 4 (almost 5) months (-25 lbs). IF water/black coffee only averaging 18:6 windows. No more prediabetes! 

The first pic was at Disneyland this summer about 5 weeks before I started fasting. Second pic is at Disneyland a few days before this Christmas. Not the best photos but I can see a difference in my face. 25 lbs down! I still have 30-40 lbs more I’d like to lose but I’m happy with my slow but steady progress! 

I started IF officially on August 1st, 2025 a week ahead of a long overdue doctor appointment on August 8th, because I was embarrassed at how much weight I had gained at the last appointment and was hoping to drop at least some water weight. I found out I was at my heaviest weight of my LIFE and pre-diabetic! It scared me straight and I have been able to stick to IF ever since. My Zero app says I got a 151 day streak today. I manage a very busy school cafeteria so I find it easy to fast 18-21 hours while I’m working. On weekends my fasts are shorter so I average 18 hours. 

I had my A1C checked again Thanksgiving week and I was sitting at 5.5, which is officially NOT prediabetic, yay! I’m working on getting it lower by my next bloodwork in the spring. As of now I’m down 25 lbs, though progress has basically halted over my 2 week winter break due to longer eating windows, more carbs/treats and less movement, but these were planned indulgences and I’m not “derailed” like I’ve thought so many times before. I’m actually looking forward to getting back to my normal routine when school resumes January 5th. 

My diet in general has improved since I reduced ultra processed carbs and cut back on the wine. I used to eat ice cream every single night and bake a few times a week and that has stopped. I think I’ve only baked 3 times since August and that was over Thanksgiving and twice over Christmas break. Progress over perfection! 

For exercise I just walk my dog. I’m fortunate to live backed up to a forest with hills and hiking trails so I’ve been utilizing that again. In addition to managing a school cafeteria I also costume musicals, am on the board of a musical theatre company, and have 2 very busy teens so my schedule is pretty tight, but this lifestyle has given me the energy to handle all of it! Plus my aches and pains have reduced drastically. I’m so grateful for this lifestyle and I’m so glad I have momentum going into the new year so I don’t have to start from scratch like so many failed years before!

I started tracking my water intake w waterminder to see if there was a pattern and turns out on days I felt the most hungry I’d only had like 20oz of water by noon. My body was sending dehydration signals that I was interpreting as hunger

I started being intentional about drinking at least 50oz during my fasting window and the difference is crazy, way less intense hunger feelings, easier to make it to my eating window, and i feel way better overall

It also helps with the eating window because I'm actually hungry vs just thirsty which was making me overeat. Im now down another 6 pounds this month which is my best progress so far

1pwo80v,Plateauing and calories,"Hello friends. (NSFW tag just in case this might trigger anyone from rule 6, which I'm trying to actively do the opposite of)

I've been on Ozempic since March 2025. I've been doing great, SW: 236 CW: 185 GW: 145. I'm only taking .75 because I honestly really don't need to up it.

I am struggling. I work out every week multiple times. I eat healthier with chicken salads and protein shakes. But, I'm struggling with caloric intake. I've been plateaued for about 2 months now, fluctuating between 185-190 because I CAN'T eat enough.  
My body is basically Constantly full and when I try to eat more, I either feel sick, or just can't choke anything down.  
The problem is that this is forcing me to stay around 900/1200 calories a day regularly. Some days I get more, some days I get less. I'm Very aware that this is not good, I'm not looking for people to tell me that I need to eat more. That's why I'm here.

My go to lately has been making a big spinach salad with seasoned marinated chicken breasts. I usually add some shredded cheese and light bacon crumbles for extra protein/sodium (mine is Very low)/calories. I usually add in some grapes or apples/pears. My trainer suggested adding some nuts and seeds, so I've started adding in cashews and pine nuts as well as sunflower kernels.  
But it's still not enough. After a full salad, I am completely full and rarely eat again during the day because anything else makes me overfull and sick. But, that's MAYBE 1200 calories if I go hard.

Guys I'm stuck. What do you all recommend? My trainer (also a nutritionist) said my TDEE should be about 1700 to start losing weight again with the amount I work out and what I eat. Help?

1pwdiqe,Weight won't budge,"
Hi, everyone!

I am 30F and have had lots of experience with IF since I was 15 (mostly for non healthy reasons. I am good now.)

I have a procedure coming up and been needing to drop ~10lbs i kind of suddenly gained during the summer (I suspect starting Minoxidil may have increased water retention. I am cutting the dose in half and then going fully off it soon to see if there is a difference).

I tracked my daily calorie intake for a couple of weeks to have a baseline and began to do IF. The scale won't budge. I can ""loose weight"" by the end of the fast, but the next day after eating, it's back to base weight, so i suspect I've only been loosing/regaining water weight. 

I added strength training and cardio a few weeks ago plus a more regimented 3 fasting days a week (M, W, F). No change so far. I am getting a bit antsy since i only have 2 months left to drop the 10lbs. 

I am doing true fasts with just water. I eat as usual on non fasting days. I never drink anything that's not water or plain tea on fasting or non fasting days.

I feel like I am going a bit crazy. Any advice will be appreciated 😊. 

P.S. I haven't been wanting to go full obsessive calorie tracking and doing a several day fast vs 3 separate 36hr ones, because of my previous history of disordered eating. But this is the first time in a long time, i am feeling that urge.",1766779377.0,17,48,intermittentfasting,weight_loss
1pw988g,Is there a way to deal with cravings?,"Hi there!

I've been looking for ways to lose weights, and currently trying out intermitten fasting + light workout/brisk wallking.

I've been eating between 10:30AM to 6:30PM the past 5 days and couple it with a 3.5 km of brisk walking. In the first 3 days, I lost about 1.1kg (Started at 99.6 and by the 3rd day, it was at 98.5kg). But on the fourth day, I couldn't control the cravings and ended up eating a lot of high calorie food - so gained 300 grams back again.

I don't really feel hungry but the cravings are a bit unbearable. Does it get better or am I doing something wrong?

EDIT: Thanks all for the responses! Here's a quick summary of all the suggestions if anybody's interested(Used Comet to summarise but have proofread to make sure that it's accurate);

- Treat cravings as largely **mental** rather than pure hunger; pause and notice what you are actually feeling when a craving hits.
- Log cravings (e.g., short voice notes) describing what you want and what emotion you feel; this can weaken the urge over time.
- Remind yourself that cravings are usually worst in the first week or so of IF and tend to ease with time if you keep going.

- Reduce or remove refined carbs and sugar, as they can spike insulin and then cause more cravings and hunger crashes.
- Increase protein and fat during the eating window to feel fuller for longer than with carb‑heavy meals.
- Focus on whole, minimally processed foods instead of ultra‑processed foods, which are engineered to be hyper‑palatable and can leave you hungrier again after a few hours.
- If you crave junk, think in terms of what nutrient it signals (e.g., salty junk = body wanting salt/fats; sweets = sugar) and plan meals that meet those needs in a healthier way.
- Build more balanced meals that cover minimum protein, fiber, and carbs; legumes were mentioned as especially filling and helpful against cravings.

- Drink plenty of water when cravings hit; some people find tea or plain water enough to ride out the urge.
- Use zero‑calorie electrolyte drinks throughout the day to reduce cravings and feelings of being “malnourished.”
- Use sparkling water or black coffee to help “trick” the brain and ride out a craving wave.

- Do not overreact to small daily weight changes (like 300 g); they are mostly water, not true fat change, so focus on multi‑week trends instead.
- Tell yourself “I can have it tomorrow” when outside the eating window; some find this makes ignoring cravings easier.
- Consider stricter structures like OMAD only if needed, and possibly combine IF with other tools (keto, calorie counting) later based on longer‑term progress.

- Prioritize resistance or **weight** training (including bands), which some users report makes them crave protein and reduce junk cravings compared to cardio.
- Match your protein, fat, and carb intake to your activity level, since heavy exercise without proper fueling can increase cravings.

- Replace refined‑carb treats with lower‑carb or more nutritious homemade alternatives (e.g., using coconut flour, natural sweeteners, etc.).
- Use fruit, yogurt, nuts, and similar foods as “sweet” or snack replacements instead of highly processed snacks after fasting.
- Do meal prep so you have satisfying, healthier foods ready, making it easier to meet cravings with better choices instead of fast food.

I have always been a plump child and early childhood boarding school made me over eat when I had access to food, during graduation and post graduation I have only constantly been eating out side and a lot of junk. I have yoyoed so much weight along the years and have stretch marks to prove it. I post graduation I got introduced to smoking marijuana and there was no looking back it was fine until I was in uni as I worked crazy hours and was mostly on my feet so I kept bouncing back and fourth, and weed worsened my relationship with food to an extent of every night smoking up and consuming thousands of calories and wonder why I am like this, I tried to beat it but the fact that all my life of working hard to make a career and then trying to make it better it was a mad rat race and I was way too worked up to realise I forgot to have fun and kept leaning on weed more and more. 

My brother had a health scare and started IF and changes for a healthy life style and 2 of my colleagues passed away due to stress related deaths also I just crossed 35 and that was it, something had to start something because I always hid my weight well as I am 173 cms broad shouldered and large framed person, but for the first time I was about to touch 100kgs on the scale and I knew it was now or never life has to change and started my IF journey.

I do still struggle with marijuana. I tried IF on it, I quit it and then re started and went on some 1000 cal binges and yoyoed again but now the binges have gotten shorter and I am not shaming myself or questioning my self worth I am noticing I genuinely like to stay happy and have a healthy diet and hate how my body feels post a binge.

Tonight I am cooking a Christmas dinner and hosting a few friends and smoked up yesterday and binged close to 2500 calories woke up and slept regretting it and didn't let it continue did my Yoga class again went on a 1 hour walk and then I realised how heavy my body feels and overall not liking the feeling I don't want to belittle myself for my actions I would like to thank my body reminding me how much my foolish activities impair it and be thankful for finding this lifestyle. who know the coming year I will stay true to my promises to myself and kick the nasty habit once and for all.

- 50g dorritos + half jar hot salsa
- 2 x cream crackers 
- 1 x home made mince pie 
- the big breakfast fry up.

I’ve been amazed to discover that if I stop eating by 4PM, I will get sleepy and be able to fall asleep at 10. The change happened shockingly fast for me - I was waking up at 7 without an alarm clock within a few days and have been since (well, mostly, sometimes I get distracted and still don’t crawl in until 11 and then wake up a little later). If I end my window at 3? I’m yawning at 8PM - that was unfathomable to me before now.

* Ultima electrolytes (2–3 packets daily)
* San Pellegrino mineral water (about one 750 ml bottle per day)

At the end of the fast, I did blood work. Here’s my data: all major electrolytes - **sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium** \- came back in the optimized range.

This mirrors my previous **9-day fast** in February, except back then my potassium ended up well above the recommended range. This time it was well balanced.

1pp1odb,Feeling Empowered!,"When I started fasting, I weighed 226lbs and 5'10"". My goal weight is 165lbs, what I weighed before having my baby ask those years ago. I had a huge gut in front of me, which restricted my breathing, and caused a lot of heartburn. I take an acid reducer and was eating tums almost every day, often more than once a day. I was having trouble getting my socks and shoes on, I couldn't manage simple exercises, and working full time as a nurse in a care home was getting difficult. I was binge eating choc bars and chips every night in bed. I asked my doctor for help and was honest. He switched me from my previous adhd med to one called vyvanse, which is used to control binge eating. It helps but doesn't prevent binging altogether for me. He also suggested IF and showed me a book that helped one of his other patients with calorie restrictions every other day. I got the book, got rid of the treats, and started. 

Restricting calories every other day was a great start. I could do one day of being hungry, followed by one day off eating normally,  and it worked to help me lose weight. 

The weight loss was dramatic to start with, simply because I was no longer consuming 200-500 in chocolates every night, and no longer consuming salty chips at night(water retention).

Then I started reading about the various IF time frames, autophagy, and tried out 18:6, skipping breakfast, sometimes having breakfast for lunch. I found it feels really good to follow this time frame. On my days off, I'll even do 20:4, but I find I get very light headed and dizzy. 

Then added in caloric restrictions to limit my binge eating during that 6h time frame. 

Added in chewing sugarless gum at night to help with food cravings while in bed because eating choc bars and chips at night in bed was my weight gain, and it's hard to resist some nights, but if I'm chewing gum(even long after it's lost its flavor) then I'm chewing something other than bad snacks. 

Lots of water during the day, black coffee, zero Gatorade that I water down half and half because I like it better that way. I recently added in jasmine green tea, which was yummy.

I've lost 30lbs before Christmas season started!

I've been having difficulty with ALL. THE. TREATS. during Christmas season, so I'm cutting myself some slack and will be happy to simply keep the 30lbs off until Christmas is over. 

Well, today I weighed in at 189!! Down 37lbs today!! I'm thrilled! I've cracked 190 today. Even if I go up a pound or two, I'm still on the right track.

I just wanted to share my story and progress with others who get it! My friends and family are always happy for me, but this group GETS IT!

1po7rn3,finally found something for fasting window hunger that doesn't involve more caffeine,"16:8 for about 6 months and those last four hours have been brutal, not physically painful just mentally exhausting. Constantly checking the clock, planning what I'm going to eat, I’m barely able to focus on anything else. Black coffee made me too jittery and anxious although it helped, sparkling water helps a tiny bit and staying busy doesn't work because my brain refuses to cooperate.

I usually don’t really trust the supplement industry too much because everything is unregulated but I started using ozzi about three weeks ago because it looked decent enough to try, it's a drink mix with konjac fiber that's under 5 calories so it doesn't break the fast. The food noise went from maybe an 8 to like a 5.5 on most days which sounds small but it's actually huge when you're trying to get through meetings without counting down minutes lol. I even managed a couple 18 hour fasts this week. And yeah maybe the effect is exaggerated a bit but it does help so I’ll probably stick with it or try some similar products

The caffeine free thing was really important for me because I was already jittery and adding more stimulants wasn't an option and almost all of the appetite supressants on the market basically rely on caffeine. Thats a reals problem for a lot of people btw when they dont check the ingredient list and just take them along with their normal caffeine intake and then they start sweating a lot and having anxiety and all that stuff. For me its an absolute no go because I take adhd meds (hence the being jittery enough) and any amount of caffeine just doesn’t feel good ever since I started taking them.

* ☀️ Mortality Link: Higher sunlight exposure is associated with lower overall cancer death rates.
* 🧬 Immune Support: Vitamin D regulates cell growth and immune responses to prevent tumors.
* 🏥 Cancer Protection: High vitamin D levels significantly reduce risks for breast and colon cancers.
* 🕒 Circadian Health: Day-light exposure syncs internal clocks that control cancer-fighting genes.
* 🕯️ Cellular Defense: Near-infrared light triggers antioxidants that protect mitochondrial DNA.
* 🕶️ Melanoma Paradox: Sun avoidance is linked to more aggressive tumors and shorter survival.
* 🇸🇪 Longevity Factor: Avoiding the sun may be as risky for mortality as smoking.
* 🍳 Dietary Impact: Reducing seed oils and increasing omega-3s can improve UV resistance.
* 🧴 Smart Exposure: Build a ""solar callus"" with gradual, non-burning full-body sun.
* 🎯 Optimal Levels: Target vitamin D levels above 100 nmol/L for peak cancer prevention.

I want to do regular intermittent fasting 16:8. But I have been trying every night for more than 9 months, and I can't even make it 12:12 on a consistent basis.

Part of the problem is my diabetes. I try to control my blood sugar, but I end up with low blood sugar in the night that requires me to eat. 

Part of the problem is a life time habit of late night eating.

Part of my problem is warewolf eating. I control my eating perfectly during the day, but at night seem to have no control. I have to rewire my brain that it is NEVER ok to eat after dinner until breakfast the next day.  

The annoying part is my body wakes me with jitters, cravings, anxiety, and this compulsion to eat. I try drinking water. I try distraction techniques. But there are still so many hours remaining and my body is insisting it has to eat RIGHT NOW and it won't allow me to go back to sleep without more food.

But then also considering doing a moderate treadmill work (45 mins at about 60-70% intensity)

Unsure because of health problems it might cause? Unsure I’ve done 48hr fasts before but not with exercise, especially since I’ll have a whole about 30 hours left after, and I imagine needing to recover without food is going to make me even more exhuasted and hungry

1pnefd2,"I have been fasting for 45-48 hours every week, for a month. Is it healthy or too much?","So I have been on and off with intermittent fasting. I just end up eating too much, when I come out of it. 12 hours or so, I can handle, but eating after 14+ hours made me want to overeat. It feels it's easier to just stay hunger, than ""tempt"" myself with food after 14 hours.

Then I started prodding perplexity.ai about fasting strategies. I am somewhat familiar with the ""longevity movement"", all the experimentation with senolytics and autophagy. From the sources cited by perplexity, apparently a 48 hour fast gets you pretty deep autophagy. A cellular regeneration/rejuvenation process sounds great. And there's apparently signs of *neuronal* autophagy, which is all the better. Beyond 48 hours may or may not be helpful. One issue is about [inflammation actually increasing with prolonged fasting](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a65377412/fasting-inflammation-new-research/). And whatever benefits there are with 48+ hours fasting, it doesn't seem worth it - and I don't have the strength for that long of a fast.

So since around 11-12th November, I have been fasting for almost 2 days every week (45-46 hours most weeks). I am seeing it from more of a lifestyle change, something I would like to follow till my untimely end, as long as it doesn't come with severe side-effects (muscle loss, cognitive impairment, that kind of stuff).

Most of the places, I am only reading good things about autophagy. I found this [reddit thread on this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/12s21xs/impact_of_adding_a_weekly_48hour_fast/), and top comment mentions 36 hours fast. But then the issue is that fasting is nonlinear: it grows with time, and doing ""multiple"" small hours fast is not the same as doing one very long hours fast. And if one has to do it, why not do as complete and deep an autophagy as possible?

Once a month seems to low: just 2 days out of ~30 not eating? Once a week is *potentially* not good, but I don't know any studies to show that. I can kind of handle it, but start feeling hungry/tired post-24 hours. But it would be quite a waste, if I start eating after 24 hours, when a 8-9 hour sleep (and additional 2-3 hours around it), gives me a nice 36 hour fast.

1pn6sz5,intermittent fasting is a life changer,"i have never ever in my entire life considered intermittent fasting. i have a high metabolism, and despite eating really healthy, it’s really difficult for me to stay full for over 3 hours. i’d get exhausted, angry, and just generally struggle to function if i didn’t eat frequently. it’s made just normal dieting and weight loss really difficult for me. so intermittent fasting sounded like it would either kill me or cause me to kill someone else

i’ve had a lot of life stuff going on that’s been making it harder than normal for me to keep up with dishes and cooking, so the other night, i just gave up and didn’t eat dinner since i didn’t have the money to eat out. i expected to be back on track the next day, but got hit with nasty sleep aide withdrawals, and just didn’t eat dinner again. i felt more energetic and focused. i researched the science and benefits behind intermittent fasting out of curiosity, but fully intended to stop once i caught back up. 

today i woke up feeling on top of the world. i should be feeling like death from withdrawals, but i feel the best i have in a while. it’s only been a few days, but i lost two pounds, eat less than i used to and feel Better, and fasting just feels easy at this point. i have a lot of food sensitivities, so i have to home cook my meals, and i have several health issues that makes keeping up with that and dishes really difficult. on top of that, eating is really expensive to me. because of my high metabolism and food sensitivities, even my $300 a month ebt check hardly lasts me, if at all. intermittent fasting is freeing for me because i can eat less now and save so much time, money and energy. i couldn’t be happier that i accidentally stumbled into it.

1pmbir8,Feedback on my morning-lunch intake to gain weight,"Hey,

I started 16 hour intermittent fasting, eating only 5am-1pm since two months. Water any time of the day. My goal is to gain weight and go to gym almost daily. I currently weigh 71-74kg, am 32M, and 176cm tall. Ideally I would be 75-80kg. So far I feel great, but I'm not gaining weight. I suspect because of lack of calories although I haven't counted. Some days I feel very very full after last meal, but most days not.

I eat when I wake up at five, a large oats-based breakfeast, and 4 protein powder scoops and creatine + vitamin supplements etc. After about an hour I go to the nearby gym and then to work at 8. At that point I try to eat a ""middle meal"", but I am uncertain about what are good options. At 12-13 I have my last meal with colleagues, usually at a lunch restaurant. Bedtime at 9pm.

My diet is mainly vegetarian + fish. What would you go for as a ""middle meal""?

So my question, what if I only get 1000 or less calories in on any given day …I’m obese so not lacking fat for energy. Or what if I don’t get enough protein in?

I began fasting from 8 pm to 10 am. I also cut out most sugars and empty carbs. The first 4 weeks were pretty rough to be honest. I struggled with headaches and low energy. Once I got comfortable with it, I stretched it out to 6 pm to 12 pm. That is still my current fasting period. I feel pretty happy with this. 

- Sleep quality has improved and snoring has significantly reduced.

- Acid reflux has almost disappeared (I was taking omeprazole every second day).

- Blood pressure has dropped from around 140/90 to consistently near 120/80.

- Clothing has gone from XXXL shirts to XXL. Size 42 pants to 38.

- Running time improved from 3-4 minutes to comfortably 20.

- I can clearly recognise the difference between food noise and genuine hunger now.

- Completed a 36-hour water fast a few weeks ago as well!

Some details about my fasting. I try to do 22 hour gaps between meals and then generally doing OMAD. I don't do it every day, id say 3-4 days a week and the days I don't follow this I eat maybe 2 meals a day but with no intended gap in between just when I'm hungry.

Like I said above I know fasting will lower my ability to eat the same volume I used to over time but why such an impact so quickly?

1pk8hp2,"Just hit 5 digits, maybe this will help someone out","Diets have never worked for me, and I've had a very unhealthy relationship with food for basically my entire life. I resolved to start IF on December 1st after I skipped thanksgiving. On the 28th I had anxiety over eating with people, and realized that night after journaling that I associate eating with shame because it's reflective of my general lack of self control when it comes to impulsivity in the face of dopamine cravings. 



I've tried calorie counting in the past and my longest streak was only 3 days - I'd stop because I wasn't prepared for how calorie dense everything I was eating turned out to be, and I was practicing avoidance. Same old thing so many people do, ""I'll start tracking tomorrow"", or shopping and grabbing a pint of Ben&Jerry's while that small rational part of myself tied up in the corner of my mind was screaming. Like I knew I was doing something damaging, I didn't even want to eat it, but it was compulsive. Like neural muscle memory. 



I've always been built pretty athletically, engage in lots of low stress cardio (walk around 30 miles a week on average), cycling, calisthenics, laser sailing, which I think kept things from getting out of hand over the years. People's eyes would bug out when I told them I weighed 250lbs, and I pass military PFAs just fine even with the extra weight, but I stated worrying about the long term effects of visceral bodyfat. Over the last couple years I've started feeling ""creaky"".  

  
My uncle died of pancreatic cancer just last year (don't mourn him, he was a reprehensible person) and I just hit my 30s, so I decided it was time to make a change. Not half hearted attempts that I'd drop the second I impulse bought frozen pizza. 

  
Like I said, diets have never worked for me, and I can't remember the last time I went more than 12 hours without eating something. After asking my extremely healthy younger brother for advice, he suggested intermittent fasting. 

  
Found this sub, browsed 300 or 400 posts sorting top / all time, and it got me psyched up to actually do this. I've always been numbers driven, so rather than trying to hit a specific target like I did when I was counting calories, I elected to calculate the total deficit I'd need (on paper, I know life can be messier than a notebook) to hit my initial target weight. 



 I decided to only eat within a 6:18 window, 1600-2200, to the point of satiety, then again if I got hungry again within that 6 hour window. 

  
It's been 12 days, and I've just passed a 10,000 deficit for the month of December, so far. This is working, I've noticed a substantial shift in my cravings, and my diet has gotten significantly healthier because I've had to ramp up the amount of protein and fiber in everything I eat to keep up with the reduced overall intake and my exercise habits. 

  
I think the thing that's helped the most so far is having hard rules. I'm on the spectrum and the longer I stick to a 6:18 interval, the easier it gets. I've also noticed that I experience food noise when I'm sedentary, but after I go to bed and wake up there's almost no hunger, which is fascinating. Earlier this month I'd be counting the seconds till 1600 so I could start eating, but now I wait till 1700 or 1800 because I just don't feel like starting right away. 

  
I've made a ritual of calculating my total daily deficit and putting it in my log every night at 0000 (I'm an air traffic controller, up until all night so it works well), and the satisfaction I've gotten from seeing that number creep up every day is something I never got when I was trying to stick to a calorie limit. 

Also my total spending on food has plummeted, which is a nice side effect.

My question is, speaking strictly outside the bounds of weight/fat loss, are there any meaningful benefits to intermittent fasting? (Say, eating within a 6 to 8 hour window and fasting for 16 to 18 hours?)

My questions are as follows:

1. If there are still benefits, what are they? I've heard people say longevity but it seems to always be in the context of fatloss....

2. What is the optimal (ish) time for fasting? 16 hours? 18 hours? Longer?

3. What is the ideal frequency for these benefits? Once a week? Twice a week? Every day?

1pj4zxs,Advice about losing the last bit,"I have been doing IF for about 1.5 years now and it has done wonders for me. I do not weigh myself and used belt size to keep track of my progress. I went from being about to switch to size 40 pants down to 34/33 pants. I do a 19/5, but really it can be a 18/6 or 20/4, just depends on when I have supper and finish for the night. It is very easy for me to maintain and I like my new eating lifestyle.

In January of 2025 I started lifting weights and gained and continue to gain muscle mass so I don’t even think about body weight but I still have a lot of subcutaneous (squishy fat) around my belly. It feels like my visceral fat is basically gone but this last level of squishy fat does not even move. To be fair I probably had this layer of squishy fat for 30 years, so I know it is a marathon not a race but it’s not even changing a little.

I know I can eat a little healthier in my eating window - I always have a healthy supper with a focus on whole food and protein but I do allow a little joy in my life and don’t mind eating chips or a sugary treat in my eating window.

I want to keep this joy. I am debating doing a 36/40 hour fast every few weeks, I can’t be consistent with it since it is important for me to eat supper with my daughter. Essentially I would only do it on nights where something is keeping me from being home on time.

Would this even help? Does anyone have any other advice on getting rid of that last 10-20 lbs or whatever it is?

I am a male in my mid 40’s if that helps.

So I guess my questions are 

is this a valid way to IF?

is it okay if the eating window shifts? (some weeks I switch to night shift so I get home from work around 5:30am, on those days ill either just eat a bunch when I get home, or do a ""lunch"" around 1am then dinner when I get home)

is it okay to not do it everyday? sometimes on my days off ill have some of what my wife's eating for breakfast or lunch

is there anything I should avoid eating during IF? Last night I got home and the first thing I ate was a big bowl of cereal, then dinner after that, is it a no no to have that much sugar after fasting? I felt fine but I dont know how glucose/insulin works with this (im not diabetic)

my goal isnt really to lose weight, its just more convenient to not have to worry about packing lunch for work, and if it turns out its actually healthier to wait until dinner, then thats a big perk. Just wondering if what im doing is valid and not doing damage

1phgk5v,I am beginning a 16:8 IF journey today and have one question (for any athletes who do IF),"Hey all, 

  
I am beginning my IF journey today, targeting a 16:8 daily IF. So far it is going well, I am following conventional wisdom such as drinking black coffee, I am about to order an unsweetened electrolyte mix for my water etc. 

I am doing IF for a number of reasons, the first being to lose weight. I am 5'10, 236 pounds as of late at 33 years old which is a lifetime high for me. In the past couple of years, my metabolism has really slowed down it seems, and keeping weight off has gone from harder and harder to now feeling impossible. A year ago I was at 220 to 225 and wanted to get down to 210, but I've only gained more. 

My other reason is that, years ago, I got a scan for something unrelated but discovered I had signs of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver along with high liver enzymes. I did get the liver enzymes under control when I started TRT (Testosterone replacement therapy) but recently my level was high again, which wasn't surprising considering my weight gain. Speaking of TRT, I like to be as least dependent on it as possible, so I think losing weight will also help my body be more optimal when it comes to my T levels as well. 

  
I don't want to resort to GLP-1 which I know can work, but is just another thing to be on daily and pay for which I don't really want. So, after some research, IF seems like a great alternative to that. I want concrete and long lasting results and a lifestyle change that I can maintain with practice. 

  
My only dilemma: I am a lifelong athlete, my sport of choice post-High School has been ball hockey. I play 2-3x a week, go to tournaments etc. I am by no means elite, but I am a pretty good player and would like to stay that way into my old age. Recently, the weight gain has drastically affected my ability to run as well as I used to when playing. I can't run as long, and because I get tired easier, it affects my skill level too because it's hard to play with a clear mind and reactions when all your body/mind are thinking is ""damn, I'm tired and feel fat"" lol. 

  
My only concern with IF is: Ball Hockey can be VERY intense and energy consuming. Your body gets beat up from the physicality of it, and often I find that I eat quite a bit following games including the following morning sometimes (depending on how not recovered I feel). In this scenario, would it be smarter to just give my body what it feels it needs (usually a mix of carbs and protein) or stick to my IF schedule anyways and push through?

***- For the first 3-4 months I did 18:6 IF*** eating between 12pm & 6pm. I was at roughly a 500-600 calorie deficit for most of this time. At 6 months, I sort of still stick to this but not as stringently. I am now at my maintenance calories most days with some days in a deficit as it's hard to meet maintenance in an IF window sometimes. 

\- I ate my goal body weight in protein every single day & am still doing so now. I usually eat low fat, low carb high in protein meals.

\- I completely removed processed sugar from my diet which was extremely soul crushing & eye opening at first on how much I depended on sugar. I learned that the morning coffee wasn't what I was addicted to, but the sugar and creamer I was putting in it.

\- I have never missed a day walking 10-15k steps, I have truly found a love for walking. Since June I have walked a distance roughly akin to walking from Miami to Boston (around 9.5 miles a day)

\- 7-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep, no excuses

**My exercise routine:**

Monday: Chest Day, 10k steps

Tuesday: Rest/HIIT/10k steps

Wednesday: Leg Day, 10k steps

Thursday: Rest/HIIT/10k steps

Friday: Arm Day, 10k steps

Saturday: Rest/HIIT/10k steps

Sunday: 10k steps (Full Rest)

  
I don't recommend going cold turkey into the working out if this is something you'd like to mirror unless you know what you're getting yourself into. This is not my first rodeo when it comes to exercise and I was well aware of what it'd take to maintain this kind of consistency fitness wise. 

**Some inspirations that got me here:**

This sub, without seeing some of the transformations here I wouldn't have believed it could happen to me.

The book ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear. This book helped change the way I look at my goals and also myself. I **HIGHLY** recommend it. Learning that it's the PROCESS to your goals that matters and the foundations in which you build them upon really pushed me forward.

1ph1253,Down 10 pounds in 4 weeks,"Wanted to share some positivity after lurking for a bit. I had a bump in the relationship around a month ago that made me realize I wasn't taking care of myself. I was overweight, my diet sucked with constant snacking, zero exercise, and most of my job involved me sitting on my ass 8 hours a day then did more of the same when I got home. I weighed myself for the first time in years and found that I was over 40 pounds above where I was at in my prime 5 years ago.

So last month I got serious. Started slow with 16:8 IF and light weights at the gym so I wouldn't get too sore. About a week in I turned it up. I would as get many steps in as I could whenever I had a break at work and lifted heavier at the gym everyday after work, then hit my gym's sauna. More importantly, I did all this fasted with at most a cup of black coffee in the stomach, and most days did OMAD with one meal at the end of the day, usually a meat and a vegetable. A few times I was able to throw in a 48 hour fast where I wasn't hungry when the time came to have my one meal, so I skipped it and waited to eat until the meal at the end of the next day. I cut out a lot of the crap I was eating before including soda, processed food, chips, etc.

In my mind I was thinking I would feel fatigued because I was depriving myself of food, but I actually felt the opposite - energy, mood, and focus were better, especially at work where I was always in a fasted state. After a month of this I weighed myself and am 10 pounds down from where I started. I really like this routine I have going and I can it's much better than I what I was doing for myself in the past. Hoping to keep this up for as long as I can.

1ph0mby,Help me help myself.,"I’m back on the IF train. It’s been a journey coming back to this lifestyle. I was in between homes and just finally locked in my own place again. I have my routine down and feel like I needed a good hard reset to get me back into the swing of IF. I have successfully lost 40ish pounds using IF (16:8), and I have another 40 to lose. 

Last Saturday I went into it cold turkey and haven’t looked back. I was on a sweets binge the week of thanksgiving so decided to also cut out sugar (not completely) but let’s just say I’m not stopping by for baked goods on my way to work, or sipping on iced coffees - dessert who? 

In a week I’ve lost 6lbs. I forgot how this journey goes - lose a whole bunch up front and then it starts to go up and down… slowly decreasing. I think with the cut out sugars and walking more - my body has started to crave less food. I also drink a lot of water, tea, and electrolytes. I’ve noticed I get fuller faster and have been having 1-2 meals a day. I’m used to eating more, but I feel like I’m reaching for food because “it’s dinner time” or “I should eat something before bed”. 

I know this sounds dumb, but how do I differentiate “I’m not hungry, so I won’t eat” between “IF” and possibly going down a slippery slope of getting an ED? I feel like I’m obsessed with thinking and planning out my next meal - meal prepping - scanning menus if I have dinner dates. I mean I feel like this is normal while on a weight loss journey, because it’s also being prepared. But idk, am I over doing it? 

Please be kind, I’m being vulnerable here.

1pfojbo,Journey for a healthier life,"I'm male, 40 years. Last years I did a health checkup and at the time I was with 87 kg (191 lb) and the nutritionist recommended go down to at least 80 kg (176 lb). 

I was fasting eventually and doing OMAD and when I was at 82 kg (180 lb) we discovered that my mother had cancer in advanced stage. This was a tuff year, spending months in the hospital with her and she has gone.

In this period I reached 92.4 kg (203 lb), mainly because there were only junk food around the hospital.

Now that it is over, I restarted my journey but my goals are:

1. Reach 73 kg (160 lb)
2. Develop stronger legs
3. To be able to perform pull up
4. Stregthen my chest

Loose weight is my top priority. I'll do OMAD for a while since it is working and when I reach a plateau I'll move to other steategy, ranging from 24 to 72 hours fasting, not more than that.

A few year ago I was an active person and went to gym 4 to 6 days a week and swin, then I decide to start crossfit and I injuried my knee. Only last year I was able to do leg exercises after knowing kneeovertoes. Now my second most important objective is strengthening my legs and glutes).

When I was at kid I was able to perform pull ups. Now, I can't do a single one. My third objective is become able to do that again at least five reps. I hope it helps to get a ""V"" shape in my back, let's see.

Then the fourth objective is improve chest muscles. I start doing push ups, I'm thinking about do 100 a day as a goal, but considering also shoulders as well. Besides push ups I go to the gym.

Start weight: 92.4 kg (203 lb)
Current weight: 87.1 kg (192 lb)
Graph weight: 73.0 kg (160 lb)

I'm traveling a lot due to my work, so it adds more challenges (not always having a gym available, social events, lunchs and dinners) and so on. When I need to skip fasting I try to compensate in the next day. Time will tell if it works.

I also reduced drinking a lot. This is another improvement I'm working on. I was not addicted but while spending a week in a working travel if I don't pay attention I could ending up drinking the entire week since some colleagues do it.

1pf2t61,Diarrhea after every fast,"Howdy folks

Relatively new intermittent faster here. I’ve started doing a simple 16/8 fast because it works pretty well with my schedule and honestly just sort of….started on its own if that makes sense? Generally I’m so busy in the morning that I can’t really eat anything until late afternoon. As a result my eating period is usually like 1-9. This allows me to get a good lunch at work, small dinner with my wife and two very small kids, and then a bit more of a substantial meal after they go to bed at 7pm. I go to bed around 11 so I have at least two hours food free before bed. 

The issue I’m running into is, without fail (and TMI warning), I get diarrhea 30min-1hr after breaking the fast almost every single time. Basically I will eat, feel great, and then suddenly have an incredible urge to move my bowels. Go to the bathroom and (TMI again) I will have a straight liquid poop that’s usually a vibrant shade of yellow. I’m usually good to go after that, but will need to hydrate well to recover. Once in awhile there will be a second bout roughly an hour later. 

Is this normal/expected? Will I eventually adapt to this? 

As a note, I’ve done the 16/8 thing in the past accidentally due to work schedule, and specifically stopped/built time into my day to eat earlier because of this issue. 

If it matters my main goal is to lose a bit of weight and just improve health. I had a bit of an alcohol issue that I’ve recently kicked but now the beer belly needs to go. This issue would happen even before I started drinking. ",1764959545.0,12,17,intermittentfasting,weight_loss

I 33M with current weight of 260 lbs has had enough and I want to turn my life and health around.
The weight gain is impacting every aspect of daily social, emotional and mental part of life .

I would like to know how to start IF ?
I work Monday to Friday and it’s a sedentary work day daily. 

I know that in the morning I need to have coffee and something to eat  because I feel light headed and low BP feeling if I don’t eat anything by 9-10 am.
I usually take home made lunch and eat at 2pm.

Haven’t exercised in forever but since last two months have started going on walks 3-4 times week for 7-10KM walks.

How do I start IF and when do I eat and when not to ?
Can I snack with a fruit in middle ? 

Please help guide and any advice and suggestion is much appreciated and thank you in advance for taking time out to guide and help. ",1764902120.0,6,19,intermittentfasting,weight_loss

1pe9089,Update: Is it time to step away from the scale?,"Tagging this NSV, because I feel victorious while the scale would beg to differ. A while back I (45F, 5'8""/172cm, SW 231, CW 201) posted about how hung up I had gotten on weighing myself and being overly concerned about my weight. I got some really good advice and thought I would share an update. I enjoy this sub so much and have appreciated all the good advice and stories shared here.

So this is what's been going on: I have continued to weigh myself daily. I went away on a work trip a couple of weeks ago and wasn't able to weigh for 5 days. On this trip, I ate pretty well and didn't stick to a strict schedule. I also walked 10k steps every day and I had a Peloton bike in my hotel room and rode it every evening. I came home thinking I would break even and I had gained 2 lbs. That was the point when I let go of caring so much about my weight.

When I got home I resumed IF and it took me several days to get back to my best eating habits. I've been back almost 2 weeks and I'm back to the weight I was before I left. I have still not seen the scale go below 200. It's annoying, but I'm not so anxious about it, because:

The other big change has been that I've been weight training. In the last 5 weeks, I have not lost a single pound, but I've lost a full inch from my waist and my body fat has gone down by 2%. I lift at least 3 times a week, and I lift HEAVY. Barbell squats, overhead press, lunges, and other good movements. My weight is staying steady, but I'm surprised at how much I am changing when I look in the mirror. Can't wait to see what happens next. I bought a couple outfits in the next size down and they fit! 

The whole situation is frankly extremely cute. I have visible biceps, legs look really good, I carried a 40 lb thing of cat litter down the stairs easily. I have not been having super long fasts because I am genuinely super hungry after a workout, and that's OK. At this point, I think my goal weight of 160 might be a bit unrealistic. In terms of body fat percentage, losing about 30 lbs of fat would have me looking pretty lean at less than 30% body fat, and I intend to increase muscle mass, so the net loss would be somewhat less than 30. Basically, at this point I'm chasing a way of looking and feeling rather than a number. It is now about feeling good about myself, and right now I do.

Thank you to everybody who gave me good advice! It's very much appreciated.",1764875759.0,21,7,intermittentfasting,weight_loss

I went to 48 as a reset after the holiday with a lot of cheat meals (I made home made mince meat pie which I hid from everyone else because it was so delicious) and wine.

My breaking fast meal was a bowl of homemade turkey bone broth, two hard boiled eggs, and an avocado.  An hour later I had a thick slice of turkey breast with a little mayo.  I am back on the 20:4 IF with my window from 1 - 5pm

For me, the hardest part was about 16-18 hours.  After that, there were no more hunger pains.  As I explained things to Ms. Misantropo86, she wants to try it, not because of weight loss (she is very fit and lean), but because of the cellular repair due to autophagy.  

I've already seen my weight go from 196 to 170 since July and my once super tight pants now needing a belt.  But more importantly, my triglycerides have fallen from 324 to 123 (in October - I have a full blood panel in January to look at it again).

(SW 220lbs, CW, 180, GW- 165lbs) I have learned a huge amount through the process. I am getting close to sixty and by Valentines Day I should be back to the weight I had when I played varsity soccer.

As I close in on my goal I have been thinking about keeping fasting as a long term part of my life. I used to have real metabolic problems including high blood pressure, fatty liver, high LDL, and pre diabetic numbers. All of those markers have improved a great deal.

I also have the classic dad bod, apple shaped tendency which means I am at higher risk for visceral fat creeping back in and doing damage. Heart disease runs in my family, so I am considering staying with fasting mainly to keep insulin levels steady so this fat does not return. This would not be fasting for weight loss so I would not focus on calorie intake. The purpose would be the benefits of lower inflammation and better insulin sensitivity.

1pce2ig,10-day fast and refeeding - My testosterone results,"Hey folks! Just wanted to share how my last 10-day water fast affected my testosterone levels. Briefly, testosterone drops quite a bit during fasting, but it comes back during refeeding.

**Total Testosterone:**

* Dec 2024: 969 ng/dL
* Feb 2025 (end of 9-day fast): 131 ng/dL
* May 2025: 564 ng/dL
* Aug 2025 (before 10-day fast): **671 ng/dL**
* Sep 2025 (end of 10-day fast): **495 ng/dL**
* Oct 2025 (after refeed): **882 ng/dL**

**Free Testosterone:**

* Jun 2023: 9.4 ng/dL
* Dec 2024: 10.8 ng/dL
* Feb 2025 (end of 9-day fast): 1.5 ng/dL
* May 2025: **7.1 ng/dL**
* Sep 2025 (end of 10-day fast): **5.2 ng/dL**
* Oct 2025 (after refeed): **10.7 ng/dL**

And this is exactly what research shows - testosterone goes down during fasting, but goes back to baseline during refeeding. And, what’s usually overlooked is the long-term effect of extended fasting on testosterone levels. Extended fasting improves insulin sensitivity, reduce visceral fat, lower inflammation, and enhance metabolic health overall. All of these factors lead to better long-term testosterone regulation.

And just to clarify - I’m not on TRT or any hormonal treatment, these are my natural levels. Of course, this is an N=1 experiment, so take it as a personal data point. I hope it gives you some idea of how extended fasting affects testosterone levels 😊",1764695394.0,25,10,intermittentfasting,weight_loss

Doctor wants me to lose another 50 and I will give it my best shot.  Though I was 160lbs in college and would just like to get back there.

My question for you all, if I know I need to adjust my eating time frame due to work or family commitments, like Thanksgiving, would I be correct in assuming that I should shorten my eating window, or lengthen my fast to adjust when I eat?

  
I guess the question is, does it really matter when my eating window is as long as I'm hitting at least the 18hr fast?

TCM:
Bok Choy (Great for stomach & large intestine, moves digestion, moistens intestines)
Soya Chicken (Strengthens spleen & stomach, nourishes blood, supports recovery)
Shallots (Helps digestion, warms stomach)
Wheat Noodle (Grounding, easy to digest when soft)

1p8o6n5,How do you choose eating window?,"I used to think intermittent fasting was just “eat later, eat less,” and that was it. Then I started paying attention to timing, and things shifted in a way I didn’t expect.

Research keeps showing that eating earlier gives people better insulin sensitivity and steadier glucose. Same food, different timing, different outcome. I noticed the same in myself. When I ate my first meal earlier, my hunger in the evening dropped, and my morning energy felt cleaner.

Circadian rhythm sounds technical, but I feel it every day. If I eat late, my sleep quality sinks. I wake up heavy, almost irritated. When I keep my window earlier, my mood stays more even.

Long fasts can help with appetite control, but when I pushed them too far my stress levels jumped. A 14 to 16 hour window works for many people, yet I think each person has to adjust based on sleep, training, work hours, and honestly just how their body reacts.

I’ve learned that consistency matters more than chasing the “perfect” number. When my eating window starts and ends around the same time, everything feels easier. When I drift all over the place, progress slows.

If you want to check what timing might work better for your schedule, this [Intermittent Fasting Calculator](https://dietsin.com/calculator/special-calculators/intermittent-fasting-calculator) can give you a straightforward starting point.",1764312518.0,7,16,intermittentfasting,weight_loss

1p5slq8,Finished my first ever 24 hr fast 👍🏼,"My weight has skyrocketed in the last couple of months and I had hit my highest I’ve been in years. 183.6 lbs. In January I was 118.4 lbs. I went through an awful breakup and completely lost control of myself. In September I was 157.3 lbs. In October I was 166 lbs. And finally, a few days ago, I was 183.6 lbs.

I was trying and failing to control my eating every day. I was binging every single night. I was insatiable. My biggest issue was that once I started eating, I could not stop. Every day I told myself “today I will do better,” and then I would binge. By the end of the day I would tell myself “tomorrow I will do better,” and then tomorrow came and I would do the exact same thing.

But when I saw that number on the scale… 183.6 lbs… I knew something needed to change. I couldn’t keep doing what I was doing. I needed to do something to get the ball rolling in a better direction. Something to kick it off. I have tried fasting so many times but always gave in. This time I was determined not to.

Yesterday I completed my first 24 hr fast (actually, I made it to 27 hours!!) and I am so so proud of myself. I finally feel that I have control again. I finally feel like I *can* do better.

I broke my fast with a banana and a protein shake, and had a few snacks the rest of the day. And, even though I felt like it at the end of the day, I didn’t binge. For the first time in a long time, I did not binge.

1p4nngg,Just completed my first EFFORTLESS 36-hour fast,"You guys. I'm so psyched. I just completed my first effortless 36-hour fast and I feel ah-mazing.

I’m posting this mainly for encouragement and to share a little hack that helped me ignore hunger pangs and actually enjoy the fast. For newbies: it's possible to go through a 36-hour fast and feel good ALL THE TIME, you just need a few things in place to prepare. 

I’ve been doing 18:6 and 16:8 for a while, and I’ve done OMAD. But any time I tried to go beyond 24 hours (like 36, 48, 52 hours) and fast overnight, in the morning I would feel faint, super weak, and a couple of times I even ended up vomiting. I honestly thought longer fasts weren’t for me cause I primarily want to feel good. Efforting is fine, but suffering is a big no for me.

This time was completely different. I feel awesome. My skin looks great, I feel lighter and slimmer. I don't want to check the scale yet -- it usually bums me out 🤣 I'll check it after I repeat this fast a couple of times.

I’m fasting mainly for health, not just weight loss. I don’t have that much to lose, but I do want to finally drop those last 5 kg that have been stubborn for like 10 years.

A bit of context: over the last few years I’ve really worked on making my life as peaceful and stable as possible. I’ve cut out a lot of unnecessary distractions and drama. During this fast I basically stayed home the whole time, which definitely made it easier. I imagine it could be harder if you’re out socializing or dealing with a very hectic schedule.

Also, I'm 32F, I'm in a great physical shape, I got my macros and hormones and menstrual cycles and supplementation figured out (and this has taken me YEARS). So I'm healthy and fit and feel good, I just want to lose those final 5kg and reach my goal weight for the first time since my teens.

Here’s what I did this time:

I started my fast at 1 a.m. on Friday and didn’t eat all Saturday.

I got hungry maybe 3-4 times. Every time I felt hunger, I turned on a stopwatch to see how long the hunger wave actually lasted.

Honestly, each wave was like 5 minutes. Then it faded, I got distracted, and I’d completely forget the stopwatch was even running.

That’s the main “hack” I wanted to share: treat hunger like a short wave and time it. Don’t react immediately. Just watch it. It passes much faster than it feels in your head.

How I supported the fast and prepped for it:

A couple of days before, I made sure to eat enough protein and fiber. I don't eat junk food, save for some chocolate here and there. 

During the fast I had only water and herbal tea and black coffee. 

I made sure to put Himalayan salt in my water, and I took magnesium.

I made sure to sip the salt water throughout the whole day and I also didn’t overdo the water amount in general because I didn’t want to flush everything out. Normally I drink around 4L a day; during the fast I think I was at around 3-4L.

I broke my fast pretty simply, no big refeed ritual or anything: Fish + rice + veggies + cheese + a probiotic.

I felt calm and peaceful the whole time. Sleep was good too, which is a big deal for me. I go to the gym regularly and if I don’t eat after training, I sometimes have trouble sleeping. Yesterday I didn’t work out, just went for a short walk, and it was totally fine.

I’ll update you all after my next 36-hour fast, because my plan is to do the next one while going to the gym as usual and see how my body responds.

Also, for context: I’m currently in my follicular phase, so this is a note to all the women here: it really helps to sync your fasting with your cycle and not push too hard during the wrong phase.

TL;DR:
Did my first effortless 36-hour fast and felt great THE WHOLE TIME. I prepped with good protein and fiber, used water/tea/coffee/salt/magnesium during the fast, and broke it with fish, rice, veggies, and a probiotic. My biggest tip is the stopwatch hunger hack: when you get hungry, time the hunger wave instead of reacting to it. For me it lasted about 5 minutes each time and then passed. Fasting almost effortlessly is definitely possible if you prepare a bit and set up the right conditions. You don’t need years of prep work, just a few key things done right.

I’ll update after my next 36-hour fast when I include regular gym sessions.

I’m also really curious to hear about other people’s experiences with 36-hour (or longer) fasts, especially how you handle hunger and energy + results you got! ",1763907052.0,67,23,intermittentfasting,weight_loss

1p4kuwb,"3 months, OMAD, high protein diet!","I was a fit individual, but i met with an almost fatal accident 2 years ago which essentially broke my back and left me paraplegic. 


Doctors said i had little chance of full recovery, but life would never be the same again. 

Fast forward two years, i have regained almost full movement in my legs. I used to always wear an AFO (like an ankle brace) to support my partially paralysed ankle. But around 3 months back, i realized that i no longer need it. 

That's when i thought that maybe the doctor could be wrong and i can get my old life back. I started OMAD (i was always used to fasting - was on keto + 16:8 regime for years before the accident) and light workouts at gym. 

2.5 months later I'm in the best shape of my life. 


I don't know how i survived the accident - was the most difficult ordeal i have ever gone through. But (hopefully) the worst is behind me.

1p4ibxj,IF during an antipsychotic withdrawal?,"So… long story cut short, I am currently going off Abilify. I had been taking 2,5 mg of Abilify/Aripiprazole as a mood-evening thing (not for the antipsychotic part, I don’t have bipolar etc.) for just under 3 years. Today is my 13th day after the very last dose. The emotional symptoms of withdrawal are slowly getting better (I’m less horribly irritable/generally wretched), and the physical ones are lessening as well (strength training classes help).

Well, the cognitive ones (thick brain fog, no ability to focus at all, have to hype myself for hours to perform a simple task) are quite distressing, but they might be getting better too (for example, yesterday I’ve managed an hour-long Zoom class on German grammar - though I’ve been as useless as the day before after that - and today my head feels a little clearer and I could manage a few work emails so far).

So, what I am getting at is… would it be okay to start on one of the softer options of IF (say, 18:6 - milder than the 20:4 regimen I’ve been planning before the withdrawal kicked in) now, since I want to lose my weight gained during the med quite a lot, or should I pace myself and wait for a couple of weeks until I’m fully myself again?",1763889362.0,1,11,intermittentfasting,weight_loss
1p4h977,Here are my thoughts.,"5' 6"", 44 y/o male.  Lost 12kg in 8 weeks by going OMAD, roughly 90% carnivore and roughly 90% keto.  No calorie counting.  I lift light weights 2-3 times a week, managing an old shoulder injury. 

I have my teenage kids every second week, for the full week.  When I'm by myself, I stick to the above mentioned regime and don't waver.  When I have my kids, I still cook them whatever they need, always have fruit and snacks available and takeaway once a week.

Eight days ago, I had a blow out with some mates.  Pizza, sugary snacks, chips, and alcohol.  Lots of alcohol.  Then the kids came home for the week.  This week, I've still stuck to OMAD, but instead of 23:1, I went 20:4, having and afternoon snack with my kids after they got home from school.  Also reintroduced some carbs and sugary treats in this 4 hour period.  

This was a test run for me.  Every week since beginning OMAD, I've lost weight.  This week, I didn't lose any weight.

How much did I put on?  Zero.  I was 72kg last Saturday before my blow out, now Sunday night, I'm still 72kg.  My takeaway?  One bad day, or a treat every now and then will not ruin your results.  I've got a couple more kgs to lose, but I'm also gaining muscle.  Don't over eat, stay active and you'll be fine.  Enjoy yourself every now and then.

1p4h0sj,Little celebration,"
So I started intermittent fasting around November 1st, have gone between 16 hrs minimum (apart from 1 day) and max 22 hours with up to a 5 hr eating period most days. Generally it's gone super well! Only had a few fasting periods where my brain has been like HUNGER!! But that's usually always the evening rather then prior to breaking my fast the following day. Hydrating helps, when I'm usually hungriest I realise my water is low. Anyway, its been 23 days and I've also reduced my meals during my eating period to 2 meals a day or 2 meals and a snack so it's a combination of things. Haven't really changed my exercise yet, very sedentary some days. However I've lost 9.5 pound so huzzah!! I know some of that will be water weight but realistically half of it should be real weight so yay. I try not to focus on the number on the scale but it's nice because I've still eaten out sometimes, had pancakes and the odd donut so it's nice that I still feel I'm living generally normally.

Do any of you have experience of trying to gain weight and build muscle while following an IF protocol? I haven't found any convincing answers, as most people say that intermittent fasting is not an ideal protocol for gaining weight, since it tends to lead to weight loss. I know this is true, but I would still like to try it for the health benefits unrelated to weight, and I would be willing to accept somewhat slower muscle growth, if the benefits are really worth it.

I am especially interested in the effects of IF on inflammation and gut health, as I have problems with both. Do you think there is a kind of trade-off between IF and optimal muscle growth or can they be compatible if I stick to my caloric surplus and have a high enough protein intake? 

I already did IF for some weeks a couple of years ago and felt really great but back in the day I wasn't doing strength training.

Stats:
	•	Weight: 250 lbs
	•	Height: 5’8”
	•	Lifestyle: Mostly sedentary
	•	Exercise: Weight training 3x/week (started Oct 20)

My IF Journey So Far:
	•	Started 14:10 on Sept 1
	•	Switched to 16:8 on Oct 1
	•	Currently on 18:6 since Nov 1

Experience:
Fasting itself has been manageable, but I occasionally get stomach cramps. On days when I don’t get enough protein, I feel hungry the next morning and sometimes break my fast early.

The Issue:
Despite being consistent, I haven’t seen any weight change or other noticeable IF benefits yet, which is getting a bit frustrating.

My Eating Routine:
	•	2–3 meals per day
	•	If I eat 2 meals, they’re ~800 calories each + a light snack → 1,800–2,000 calories total
	•	If I eat 3 meals, they’re ~600 calories each + snack → 2,000–2,100 calories total (usually weekends)

My BMR:
Based on calculators, my BMR + sedentary lifestyle puts me at a higher maintenance level than what I’m currently eating, so I should be in a calorie deficit.

My Question:
If I’m staying under my calorie budget and fasting consistently, why am I not seeing any changes? Is something off with my body, or is this normal in the early stages?

I’m 34 and lately I’ve been struggling with consistency. I’ve done fasting before — 16/18 hours and even 24 hours — and I always felt great: lighter, more focused, and most importantly, it helped me stop thinking about food. Mornings were easier, and I didn’t snack throughout the day.

Now, for some reason, I’m feeling more hungry in the morning. I end up eating breakfast without actually being hungry — just out of habit — and it’s breaking my rhythm.

My main challenge:

I run or do strenght workout at lunchtime.

If I’m doing a 16/18-hour fast, I usually break it before training because I’m afraid I won’t have enough energy. So I get stuck in this cycle where I want to return to fasting… but I can’t fit it in properly with my training schedule.

Another point: I work from home, which makes fasting harder (food is always around), but I know it’s not impossible.

For those who’ve dealt with this:

— Do you train around noon and stay fasted? How does your energy hold up?

— Did you shift your eating window to start later?

— Or did you just accept that fasting doesn’t fit well in this phase?

Fasting really helps me mentally, but I’m struggling to bring the habit back.

1p0ftcn,10-day water fast - My Heart Health panel during the fast and after refeeding,"Hey folks! I thought this might be interesting to share. I just completed my post-fast refeed, did another blood test, and compared my Heart Health biomarkers during my 10-day water fast (Sept 4) vs about a month later, after full refeeding (Oct 14). During the fast, many markers were off, and once I refed and stabilized, everything bounced back.

* ApoB: 136 (High) → 87 (Optimized)
* LDL Cholesterol: 161 (High) → 117 (Borderline)
* Total Cholesterol: 242 (High) → 201 (Borderline)
* Triglycerides: 163 (Borderline) → 44 (Optimized)
* HDL Cholesterol: 50 (Normal) → 71 (Optimized)
* hsCRP: 0.2 (Optimized) → 0.3 (Optimized)
* Overall Heart Health Score: 54 (Fair) → 92 (Optimal)

If you’re wondering why my ApoB and LDL spiked, here’s how it works. During fasting, the body switches to fat metabolism - fat gets mobilized, and LDL particles carry that fat around the body for fuel. Same thing happens during IF and a steady calorie deficit, when the body burns fat for fuel. It’s a feature, not a bug 😊 Once you refeed and stabilize, lipid transport normalizes. Triglycerides drop, HDL rises, and ApoB falls right back down.

So if your blood test looks worse right after an extended fast or during IF/calorie deficit, don’t panic - it’s just your metabolism doing its job. I was a bit surprised that my LDL and total cholesterol didn’t drop lower, but that’s fine - I hope it’s just a matter of time.

I was inspired to try IF, so I jumped right into an 18:6 window. Judge me if you wish, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're crazy like me, but in my case, it worked out. (For those concerned, I'm 27, no big health conditions, weigh about 180lbs, and I work out).

  
Day one sucked. I'm a night-time eater, normally I would eat a meal at midnight, snack until 3am. So, first night, only water, it was brutal. Following morning I was beyond starving. My hours are 2pm to 8pm for eating, so the MINUTE it hit 8pm, I feasted lol

  
Day two was slightly easier. Nighttime cravings were there, but not as severe. In the morning, I was hungry, but again, slightly easier. My feasting at 2pm was slightly less intense.

  
Day three (beginning that night) my cravings practically never happen. Minimal at most. In the morning, I wasn't hungry. It wasn't until 1:30ish that I got any cravings. However...

  
When I ate that day, I had some healthier yogurt, and a boost shake, and I was full. Like, completely full. Almost stomach ache level. No feasting, no sugar cravings at all. An hour or two later I had some apples slices, and I was full again. That night, no cravings at all.

  
Meanwhile:

On day 3, without even thinking about it (placebo) something felt off in my body. I quickly realized my knees were not aching like typical, especially in the morning. I work 12 hours shifts in an ER, and I did 18,000 steps that day, and my feet hurt only half as bad as typical, and my legs weren't even tired. Not only that, but my energy was WEIRDLY good all shift. I had 1/3rd the coffee I normally have in a 12 hour shift. I also didn't sleep the best leading into this shift. It was a little hard to believe but it was real lol.

  
I've never been so surprised by a health decision in my life. I've done multiple diets, fitness plans, etc. and this has been very eye-opening. I'm about to lock into this for the long-run now!

1oz20n7,Long term effects of IF?,"Hey there, I started doing intermittent fasting 18:6 hours the summer of 2024. That summer I was able to lose quickly around 22 lbs, with some daily cardio exercises like speed walking and cycling uphills or just working in lab without breakfast. 

Suddenly, I reached a plateau with my weight, however, my fasting blood sugar level did not drop significantly even though I had lost weight mainly to increase my insulin sensitivity (at some point I also monitored with a CGM, the only way I was able to get the blood sugar down was through fasting at least 18 hours, I believe this is the main reason why I lost weight). 

At my plateau weight: (fasting 5 pm to 11 am)
- I had more or less same fasting blood sugar levels as when I was overweight 
- I was having trouble sleeping or waking up in the middle of the night because of a headache or overactive mind
- My metabolism became really slow and my body was digesting everything very slowly
- I started to overeat/could not eat enough before my fasting window closed
- Started to have cravings at late night or evenings
- Having trouble sustaining the fasting period while having a 9-5

This made me realize that intermittent fasting is not sustainable, because it was causing me problems and at some point it was not helping me anymore to lose weight. I stopped doing it + had a crash in good diet, which caused me to gain most of the weight back and I am still gaining it. When I try to re-start intermittent fasting, I am scared that the restricted window makes me overeat/binge, which makes me have a negative relationship with food. Can someone help me find a way in which I could incorporate intermittent fasting without it negatively effecting me. I am trying to stop fasting and allowing myself to eat what I want, but this has caused me to continuously gain weight since I am more insulin resistant + more likely to gain weight in my mid-section due to genetics. 

Thanks in advance.

I end the week/start the new week with a ± 36 hour fast typically from Saturday night to Monday morning. I've never had any problems with this fast. In fact I got used to it very fast (Muslim background) and actually find it quite enjoyable. 

But today (20 hours into fast) for the first time, my hands started shaking. It's cold and rainy but I broke out into a sudden sweat on my face, too. 

Nothing has changed about this fast. There have been fasting days where I killed myself at the gym without anything happening, and today quite frankly I've been pretty sedentary (no gym, ±4k steps). I'm drinking my water. I can't think of a single thing that's different. 

Could this be a matter of age, getting older? Something to be concerned about? I haven't broken my fast, just went to lie down, but would you advise that I should? Any input/insight would be appreciated.

Anyways, I'm 5'4"" at 176.2, down from 182 when I started IF.

I realize that a lot of the initial loss is water weight, but I'm wondering if I'm losing weight too fast, because I'm waiting and waiting for my second postpartum cycle to come. My first one started 10/11/25. So, I don't know if some combination of residual postpartum weirdness, a very stressful October, and fasting, have contributed to my period being late? I took a pregnancy test this morning and it was negative.

From what I researched, it's potentially better for women to not fast after ovulation, or at the very least, not to have such a short eating window during that time. But 20:4 is working well for me in terms of my daily routine, mental clarity, and obviously the weight loss, too.

I'm just bummed because I'm so excited to finally be losing weight (haven't been successful in losing weight since summer of 2020) but I don't want to jack up my fertility either. I did try to search this sub, but there were extremely few posts about periods, much less postpartum ones. Anyone here go through something similar?

Currently my thought is to stay the course and get down to a healthier weight first, and worry about periods and fertility later, but I see that this may not be the healthiest course of action. On the other hand, I had gestational diabetes during pregnancy and I'm scared to develop type 2 if I don't change my ways and weight for the better.",1763019172.0,4,11,intermittentfasting,weight_loss

1ov9rz2,I’ve been doing 16:8 for 6 months and I’m getting better at hunger control during the last hours,"Started 16:8 back in May and conceptually it made total sense to me. I've never been a breakfast person anyway so skipping it felt natural enough, my eating window is noon to 8pm which works perfectly with my work schedule.

The problem was those last two hours before my window opened were absolutely brutal. Like around 10am to noon I'd be so hungry I could barely focus on anything, stomach growling during meetings, getting irritable with coworkers for no reason. I was drinking black coffee, green tea, tons of water and it didn't really help much, the hunger was genuinely distracting and I was starting to think maybe fasting just wasn't for me even though I liked the simplicity of it.

Everyone kept saying your body adjusts after a few weeks but I was two months in and if anything it was getting worse not better. I was genuinely considering giving up because white knuckling through hunger every single day felt unsustainable long term but then someone in this sub mentioned using konjac fiber during the fasting window since it's basically zero calories and doesn't break your fast. I started mixing it with water around hour 12 or 13 and honestly it changed everything for me. The constant food noise in my head went from like an 8 to maybe a 3, I can actually make it to hour 16 now without obsessing over the clock. Some days I've even pushed to 18 hours which I never thought I could do.

I still get hungry obviously but it's manageable now instead of overwhelming. If you're struggling with fasting hunger and thinking about quitting, might be worth trying something like this before you give up completely.",1762964826.0,40,20,intermittentfasting,weight_loss

1ov28c6,No1 Month on Intermittent Fasting — Down 2.4 kg and Feeling Stronger!,"Hey everyone!
Today officially marks 1 month since I started intermittent fasting, and I wanted to share a little progress and motivation.

✅ I started at 75.2 kg, now I’m 72.7 kg.
✅ I’ve been fasting around 18–21 hours daily, keeping my calories around 1200–1300, and focusing on strength training 3–4x a week.
✅ My body fat dropped, muscle % went up slightly, and I feel so much lighter and more in control.

It hasn’t been perfect — there were bloated days, sore days, and days I wanted to quit — but I’m proud that I stayed consistent. My goal is to reach the 60s by the end of the year, and this is just the start.

If you’re just beginning: don’t stress the scale every day. The body changes quietly before it shows. Just keep showing up 🤍",1762945417.0,51,7,intermittentfasting,weight_loss
1ov1aqg,"Just hit 96.9 kg this morning – and immediately wanted to ""celebrate"" with food, more food and even more food. Then I realized I've been doing this the ENTIRE time.","[Reached a new milestone, so happy about that, but...](https://preview.redd.it/0e1ashhcxs0g1.jpg?width=1158&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4694d5c555795357e80386d12bfa346c8dc9f2d)

This morning I stepped on the scale: 96.9 kg (213.6 lbs), yeah!!!

Finally under 97. Huge milestone for me.

Setting milestones like this has been HUGE for my motivation. Every 3-4 kg goal keeps me going. But here's the really weird thing I just realized:

My FIRST thought when I hit it? ""Hell yeah! Time to celebrate!""

And I always celebrate the same way: with food...

Every single milestone (109kg, 106 kg, 103 kg, 99 kg, etc.) triggered a little celebration wave. Strongest on milestone day, then it ebbs over the next few days. Not dramatic, just... slightly more than usual.

Result? I'd plateau for 1-2 weeks. Every time.

I've lost 32 pounds in 3.5 months doing 16:8 IF (eating 6 AM - 2 PM), but I never connected these dots until this morning. I just thought plateaus were random.

No I think... They're not. I was unconsciously sabotaging myself in celebration mode.

And here's the weird part: I'm not even sure if I want to STOP doing this! Maybe celebration waves are fine?

But now I'm AWARE of it. I SEE the **pattern**, my personal dynamic, when reaching a milestone.

And that changes a lot for me.

Today, hitting 96.9 kg, I can FEEL great and the wave is starting again. Instead of immediately starting to eat wild or planning what to eat, I went for a long walk this morning. 12,000 steps. Gave myself time to just notice the urge without acting on it.

I'm still open to how I'll eat today. Maybe I'll celebrate. Maybe I won't. But whatever I do, it'll be a **CHOICE**. Not autopilot.

Anyone else notice patterns like this? Behaviors that run on autopilot until you suddenly SEE them? Please let me know! Am I the only one?

Do you have celebration waves too?

*(I wrote more about this on my blog if anyone's interested – link in my profile. But honestly, I'm just curious if I'm the only one.)*",1762941956.0,124,11,intermittentfasting,weight_loss
1ov194k,Should I increase my calories?,"

Hello! I'm a 34 year old male, and I've been doing OMAD for a month now. Getting back to it actually after doing it a few years ago, so I'm quite used to it.

CW: 219 lbs, GW (for now) 198lbs, 6""1.

I cook a lot, and I track every nutrient as close to possible using a scale and cronometer. I've been paying extra attention to having a high protein, and diversified intake, and supplement as needed (but my macros are pretty good).

Doing that, I've been consuming around 1300 calories daily, for a TDEE around 2700 calories.

I know that's a huge deficit, but I've been feeling better than ever for the last 5 weeks. No headaches, dizziness, massive hunger or fatigue to complain about. Been having a hearty meal everyday at the same time. So, even though it's not recommended, is there any point to up the caloric intake if I keep feeling this good? I know the common risk is muscle mass loss, and I'm trying to offset that with a good protein intake (around 1.2g/kg), and some resistance training 3x/week. My current plan is to go down to 198, and up the intake closer to BMR once I'm there, to have a more reasonable deficit for the last pounds I want to lose.

1oul8kh,my version of IF for night shift,"I wanted to share the IF schedule that's been working for me on night shift.

For background, I was doing really well on a 16/8 schedule for about a year before I started working night shift. I lost weight and kept it off just by eating between 12 pm-8 pm every day (I'm a 5'4"" female and went from about 150 lbs to 120 lbs). Then I started working 7 pm-7 am three nights a week, and I was never able to to figure out how to make it work. Over the course of a few years, I gained most of the weight back. Most people, including myself, who work this night shift schedule, do not stick to night shift schedule on their days off. If you're flip flopping between being awake all night and during the day, it's kind of impossible to maintain a consistent IF schedule IMO. At least I was never able to figure it out.

I tend to eat when I'm not hungry and don't have a lot of self control. But I have found working night shift that I have more self control at work than I do at home. What I've started doing is basically One Meal A Day but only on the nights that I'm working. So for example, if I work Monday-Wednesday night, it would look like this:

Wake up Monday morning, eat as usual, take nap before work

Bring a meal to work, eat big meal at around 5 am (sometimes I'm too busy and can't eat until closer to shift change at 7 am, but I always make sure 5 am is the earliest I eat), go home and sleep

Wake up Tuesday afternoon, go to work, eat meal at 5 am, go home and sleep

Wake up Wednesday afternoon, go to work, eat meal at 5 am, go home and sleep

Wake up Thursday afternoon, eat whatever I want until my next shift (eg Monday night)

When I'm not working, I eat whatever I want. I just started doing this around a month ago. I've lost about 5 lbs and feel a lot better. I'm less bloated and an added benefit is that my sleep has improved. (When I used to eat more at work, I'd come home and actually be hungrier and end up eating at like 8 am which would make me take longer to fall asleep. Now since I eat a big meal at 5 am, I go home and fall asleep.)

This is not my first time with IF. I did it 2 years ago for 6 months and lost about 12 kilos during that time. Then tragedy struck in the family, and I fell back on my bad eating habits and gained back all that weight.

I have no problem going through OMAD daily as I can resist any cravings before my eating window. But a 48-hour fast is a new territory for me.

Regarding the Oral Rehydration Salt, I am talking about this [particular product](https://www.mims.com/philippines/drug/info/hydrite?type=full) where I live. I know this is normally used for people with diarrhea, but I'm wondering if I can also consume this while doing a 48-hour fast.

1otb4xc,The unhealthy thing about fasting is eating again?,"I mean, if you just don't ever eat again, that's no good. More specifically what I'm worried about is the refined carbs.

There have been some studies over the past while saying that fasting might pose some health risks. I am actually fairly skeptical of some them, but still it's foolish to just brush off studies that contradict they way we like to see things. With anything that you do, it's good to look at in what ways it could be unhealthy, jogging, weight-lifting, eating vegetables.

And one key thing that fasting seems to do is make you more sensitive to blood sugar spikes than normal. Like breaking a fast with a chocolate bar sends you blood sugar skyrocketing much more than it would for someone who just eats chocolate bars all the time (neither being particularly healthy). Those spikes are really unhealthy, they damage blood vessels, make you insulin resistant, cause inflammation, a bunch of things.

Only so much research I guess, but it seems like it has found that. And people doing keto also seem to be at risk of big lethargy-inducing blood sugar spike if they go on a carb binge cheat. Keto and fasting are similar things. 

This is of course very much a short term effect, of hitting your fasted ketogenic metabolism with refined carbohydrates. I would at least hope that fasting is good for your metabolic system over the long term.

So maybe doing OMAD and eating three meals worth of food at once is actually totally feasible and healthy. But eating three meals worth of refined carbohydrates in one sitting is not. Could be people doing intermittent fasting are actually exposing themselves to a lot more blood sugar spikes than someone eating an normal everyday unhealthy diet.

Some important context here is that we live in a world with a ridiculous amount of refined carbohydrates. So you could even be cutting down on processed food and eating healthy but still getting enough carbs to give you big blood sugar spikes.

The actionable take-home could be that fasters should adjust their macronutrients towards more protein and fat, and less carbohydrates? Especially refined carbs, whole grains, fruit, beans aren't so bad. ",1762773470.0,12,35,intermittentfasting,weight_loss
1otauf7,Help finding an IF to fit with meds and exercise,"I'm wondering if anyone here can help give me suggestions on getting started with IF within restrictions I have. 

TLDR: I have to take medication morning and evening, so 16:8 type doesn't fit? Looking at 5:2, but I exercise and do sport 5 times a week - how to fit the fast days in? 47yo female who wants to fit better in my clothes.


Some more details (thank you for reading!): 

Medication preventing 16:8 type fasting:
- I have medication must be when I wake up and pretty much before I go to sleep. No negotiation. I don't necessarily have to have it on food, but it is something that activates my digestive system. 
- I did search here and online a few times to see if there's any evidence about medication breaking a fast, but there's not much reserach. For something like 16:8, a key is getting to the metabolic 'switch' of proper fasting. Meds could prevent this, therefore missing this benefit.
- I have tried 16:8 before for over a month, but didn't see results for reducing my size, plus I struggle to not binge eat as my window starts. 

Best thought is 5:2 fasting:
- As it doesn't rely on the metabolic 'switch' just serves as a way to (hopefully) reduce weekly calories, it can fit with having my meds
- However, I need advice on how to fit with my exercise (which I love, but I'm not losing weight on): Monday, Thursday and Friday 6am weights and cardio 45 minutes, Monday 5pm Pilates and Tuesday 8pm 1.5 h of soccer. I am WIPED out after soccer, and can't see a way to not need fuel before and after. I have also felt quite faint in cardio classes (like like on the floor legs up). These are socially organised, so another schedule isn't possible.
- I think weekend fasting could be too hard with social or if chilling with not much to distract.

Goal: better fit in my clothes. Weight creeping up female perimenopause (so inspired by what positive stories I read on here). I live in Asia and finding anything above XL is near impossible off the shelf. Plus I hate clothes shopping. I've tried counting calories with MyFitnessPal and Noom, but saw very little results that way, so hoping for IF.

Thank you if you read this far - I know it's a lot of info, but tried researching, search on here and even ChatGPT, but haven't found a fit.

Questions (answers to any will do!):
1) Anyone had 16:8 type fasting be successful when having to take meds morning and evening?
2) Could 5:2 work from like 6pm Monday to 6pm Tuesday, so lunch Monday, no dinner Monday (or small snack), but meal before soccer Tuesday? Then again Thursday breakfast ('no' lunch) until lunch Friday?
3) Tips for fasting with exercise.
4) Tips for reducing that 'binge' post fasting window.
5) (bonus question - fasting day vegan snack suggestions?)
6) Anything else I could think about?

1os1mkr,Three pants sizes down after 6 months of 16:8,"I (39 F) have struggled with my weight all of my life. In 2024, I hit 308 pounds due to stress, poor eating habits and medication that caused my weight to tick up. I was devastated and embarrassed that I allowed my weight to get that high, and when simply walking resulted in heavy breathing, I knew I was in a really bad place.

I actually learned about intermittent fasting here on this subreddit. I started 16:8  in May, and it was surprisingly easy for me as my body adjusted well to the change. When I hit a wall, I did a longer fast for a day or two and go back to 16:8.

I’ve started looking at food more as a fuel so my eating habits have improved (I developed a bit of a stress-eating habit after two layoffs in two years,) and I’m moving more too as my depression lifts. I was with a friend Friday and noticed she was speed-walking but I was keeping up no problem. I was ecstatic.

Today for the first time in five years, I fit in a size 18. I started at a 22 inching towards 24. 

IF has felt sustainable. My energy levels have improved. My self-esteem is improving. I just feel better. I’m hoping to reach my goal weight by the end of 2026.

I’ve been inspired by so many of your stories. I’ve been grateful for this community. Wishing you all continued success on your health journey.

1ory7bv,"From 400 to 177, thankful for discovering OMAD to help me maintain.","Due to mental health struggles, I used to binge eat. I saw it as a way of “coping” or distraction. Combine that with our current food environment, and the result was me weighing over 400lbs. However, when I turned 29, I decided not to spend my 30s as heavy as my 20s. And thanks to an unexpected wave of motivation, the majority of my weight loss wasn’t much of a struggle for me, and I was able to get under 200lbs in about a year and a half.

However, while there was not much food noise in the beginning, once I got in the “onederfuls,” it was like a switch was flipped, and it has been a struggle ever since. Maintaining/ continuing toward my goal weight of 160s has been much more of a challenge for me than losing the first 200lbs. In the summer of 2023, I gained 50lbs or so back. I was able to re-lose that weight, but the last few months I have been struggling with a desire to binge eat again, even caving in about a month ago and binging for the first time since 2021. 

But while it has been a struggle, I have been hanging in there. I have even finally escaped the 180s, where I have been stuck for over a year. As to how I do it, I go to the gym daily and do OMAD. Wanting to have good workout sessions has discouraged me from binging, knowing the gym will be a struggle in the following days. And OMAD helps me in several ways. The convenience of only having to make food once a day. I find it hard to stop eating once I start, and only having to start once a day is much better for me. And while I would like to view food with less emotion and more practicality, I look forward to having my meal at the end of the day. I don’t view OMAD and weight training as THE tools to weight loss/ maintaining, but simply tools that work for me. It’s all about understanding what your personal struggles are, and finding tools that will work for you. 

I don’t have many people in my life I can talk to about my food struggles, and Reddit has been a great resource for me. I’ve had accounts in the past, but I always ended up deleting them because I struggled with the temptation to disappear and succumb to my food addiction. And while I feel that obesity is a societal problem, and the solution is a societal change, I don’t feel like that’s in the cards for us, so self-improvement and encouragement is all we really have. And if anyone would like to talk about CICO, fasting, working out, binge eating, etc, feel free to comment or message me. Thanks for reading. ",1762630159.0,3842,153,intermittentfasting,weight_loss

I came on here to check if a 3-day fast was good, but I keep seeing people saying they’re doing longer ones — even 21 days?! I thought that had to be BS, but apparently, you can actually live that long without food?

How often do you guys fast like this? I was thinking of doing it 2–3 times a year, but I see a lot of people saying they do it every month. Is that actually better or just overkill?

1oreh7d,"IF has helped me stop feeling cold from CCR, build a balanced relationship with food, helped me understand who I am as a person, and more.","Hello all, I've been getting more involved in this community and am very thankful to everyone for their feedback and contributions. I want to share what I've experienced recently. 

DISCLAIMER: I do mention my faith in this post, only because I feel that intermittent fasting has helped me hold a more holistic view toward fasting, but also toward being a human that is spiritual but also lives in a body. 

I've lost a bunch of weight with CCR/deficit/calorie counting over the last year and a half or so. EDIT: M, 5'9"" SW: 227, CW: 141, GW 145. I weighed everything and sought a high protein diet, with thoughts of fiber close enough for me to know that it's important for satiety or something. I randomly started listening to Rhonda Patrick (I think through JRE), I learned about the gut microbiome, and then about TRE with the podcasts she's done with Dr. Satchin Panda. I started reading about chrononutrition, eTRE, etc and it was very enlightening and interesting to me. 

Along with this, I started seeing a dietician as I realized that my whole life, I either have been very overweight, or went down in weight just for it to go back up (only happened once, thankfully). My primal thought was ""I've always eaten in excess or in scarcity,"" which is true, but I hadn't qualified that with food on a time scale yet. I wanted to find a way to maintain my weight for life. --An important side note is that I also had seen a doctor recently toward the end of the CCR and labs revealed a small anemia, which I've never had. I also had been feeling very cold, and even in August/September in Texas I was wearing multiple layers and still cold.-- In our first meeting, all of the fear I had of being judged for being a calorie-counter diminished. She was very accepting and made me feel very comfortable in session. She immediately recommended I go up 300kcal per day to 2500kcal. I work out 30mins5x per week (free antidepressant!) so she calculated I wasn't eating enough. At this time I started experimenting with 16:8, 3 meals. I immediately felt free when she told me I could eat more than 2200kcal. Things were going well. 16:8 began to feel very manageable. Because of my work, though, it didn't make sense for me to take time to eat 3 meals a day, so that eventually just turned into 2 meals, basically doing 18:6-- and, wow. I've saved money and time in not having to make 3 meals every day. It's easier now, being able to have a time to stop eating, and a time to stop thinking about food prep-- it's freeing! I met with her again after one month and now I'm up to 2800 calories, which feels way too high, but I trusted her math and, despite that it has been VERY stuffing, I feel great. This is where she reminded me that my metabolism is a fire I need to feed. I didn't make sense of this until it came to my mind that if I eat adequately but also fast my body can draw from fat to match the amount it needs to keep functioning and not need to slow down my metabolism. Anyway, I'm currently trying to see if this is the right amount. Back to the time-piece: with IF I find myself with so much time-- tonight I picked up my guitar and played some jazz charts, which was a good-as-dead habit in my life for a long time. I've learned that a feeding/fasting life rhythm gives you the time to DO the things we're called to do.

Somehow, sometime throughout this I found this sub. I learned about the obesity code and read it. Wow. I then found a book that helped integrate this with my religious views, which was extremely helpful (I mention this because our relationship with food is holistic, and for me, my faith in Christ had been informed that I had to fast, but honestly, I started becoming more a fan of the science than for other reasons. The book I read -- Eat. Fast. Feast. By Jay Richards, brought an integrated approach that helped put my faith at the center while still being scientifically informed). These two books, and this sub have done so much to help me understand why, from a biological standpoint, fasting is supposed to be descriptive as a big part of our relationship with food. 

Fasting has helped me have a way more flexible relationship with food. This has been huge because I have been consumed by food most of my life. I love to cook, it's my love language, and so while there are many amazing things in my life that God has granted me through food and cooking, it was taking up more space in my life than what is beneficial. In regards to eating, I now know that I don't have to eat all the time, bc my body is designed to keep me fueled, whether that is by what I ate recently, or have stored as fat. My blood sugar will stay stable in the fasting state bc in lipolysis, we get 3 FFA molecules and a glycerol molecule, and the glycerol molecule goes to the liver to preserve the glucose level. Autophagy can happen. Ghrelin isn't what the Freudian theory of drives describes-- it comes in waves that we can longsuffer with Christ. Because of Eat. Fast. Feast. I was able to learn that there is no eating without fasting (even in a 12:12 TRE that people can do without much thought at all-- some may even do this without thinking!), and there's no fasting without feasting. It helped me integrate what fasting is from the biological perspective that's been fascinating me to my faith, which is most important to me. Seeing that there's a time for everything, I now hold the belief that as humans, we should not view feeding in isolation, nor fasting in isolation, but together in a balance. This taught me that feeding and fasting can have boundaries and that there's a time for each of them

Elucidating that thought, a rhythm of Feeding/Fasting also taught me the idea that balance operates out of simplicity, not duplicity. Let me explain. Simplicity is doing one thing at a time. Duplicity is doing two things at once.  A period of (sufficient, whole) feeding matched by a period of fasting is more metabolically health-oriented than doing both at the same time (like in constant caloric restriction, where the reduction of calories matched with day-long feeding breeds a slow metabolism because insulin never got low enough to stop inhibiting lipolysis, and not to mention, never allowong for a period of fasting where AMPK can do it's magic).

Picking up what I said earlier about the anemia and coldness: Today in the morning I didn't really feel like wearing a sweater, mostly bc I didn't have one clean that matched with my pants lol. But I still wore a grey hoodie anyway. I realized that I was now starting to feel warm, and maybe even perspiring in this hoodie. IF, along with the 2800 calorie diet, has helped me to stop feeling cold, give me a desire to think less about food, be able to eat to fuel my metabolism without it all going to fat bc of insulin clearing in fasting oeriods, and, maybe this is placebo, but I feel my stomach fat has gone down. 

So I find myself praising God and feeling thankful for the resources and redditors that I've learned from along the way. 

In short, IF has served as a means of grace to discover what our bodies are designed to do and capable of doing. It is also seeming to be the means of grace in healing my body from the CICO-induced metabolic slowdown. I found out that if you do it wisely, fasting is never torture, it's actually necessary for metabolic health and for the prevention (not to mention treatment) of hyperinsulinimia and insulin resistance. IF is built from a philosophy that there is a time for building up (feeding, where mTOR is active in the anabolic state) and a time to tear down (fasting, where AMPK is active in the catabolic state). One state needs the other, and both cannot function at the same time. Operating in our design lets food be in its rightful place and fasting be in its rightful place, both with the boundaries and dignity that they deserve. IF has helped me build a better philosophy of who I am from a domains standpoint (that is, an integrated physical and spiritual person), where everything I do, whether it's primarily a physical (or emotional, mental), or spiritual act, affect all domains because we are integrated beings. 

I hope this post is appropriate. I'm just overflowing with joy for what I've been taught. Thank you!!",1762571074.0,9,2,intermittentfasting,weight_loss

1oqx366,My 10-day water fast - Blood glucose data,"Hey folks! I wanted to share my glucose data from a recent 10-day water fast. My starting point was around 100 mg/dL, and for most of the fast, my blood glucose stayed in the 60-70 mg/dL range - though it always went up a bit after gym sessions.

One unusual thing - on day 6, it dipped to 42 mg/dL, the lowest I’ve ever seen. I was at my son’s soccer tournament that day - 95°F, under direct sun, quite brutal. Surprisingly, I felt ok and quite freaked out. The good thing I remembered a Reddit post from someone who also fasted and hit glucose levels in the low 40s during a doctor’s visit. He felt fine, though the doctors were completely puzzled - he never told them he was fasting ☺️

So, I kept checking my glucose to see what was going on, and it rose to 58 quite fast

* 1:04 pm – 41
* 1:05 pm – 43
* 1:31 pm – 52
* 2:16 pm – 58
* 2:17 pm – 56
* 3:23 pm – 54
* 4:29 pm – 67
* 7:38 pm – 54

By the next morning, glucose was back above 60. After breaking the fast, it spiked briefly to 123 mg/dL, then settled around 100 again.

I know there’s nothing great about seeing glucose that low - and I hope it never happens again - but I wanted to share this so others don’t panic if they see something similar during an extended fast.",1762528609.0,9,6,intermittentfasting,weight_loss
1oqwssc,Would Ozempic still work?,"27(F) 115kg 170cm
I've been doing IF for years, and it was successful at first, but at some point my body got used to it and I gained some of the weight back. Now I do OMAD 5 days a week and about 18:6 on the weekends, but not particularly strictly. For me, IF is no longer a means of losing weight, but simply practical so that I don't have to worry so much about meals.
I consume about 1200 calories a day, about 1500 on weekends, and even though I'm in deficit, my body has probably just adjusted its metabolism. (Of course, I also make sure I get enough protein.) Eating more on weekends will also be a problem because the body could start storing the extra calories – these are just my assumptions based on experience.
I'm now considering starting Ozempic to lose weight. My concern, however, is that it might not work because I don't have a problem with unconscious/constant eating or feeling hungry all the time. 
Has anyone had any experience with this?
Of course, I don't want to discourage anyone who is starting IF or OMAD.

1oqvzfv,How Intermittent Fasting Changed My Life..,"Just as the pandemic began to tighten its grip on the world, I was freshly coming to terms with the fact that my nine-month marriage was heading toward separation and soon, divorce. The discovery of infidelity shattered me, and depression began to peak alongside the global crisis. Life felt like it was collapsing from all sides. No gyms, no gatherings, no social life, no friends - just long, physically demanding shifts as a driver, often stretching beyond ten hours. With public restrooms closed, coffee shops became my only option, and each stop meant grabbing a coffee or a savory snack, regardless of the time. I was entering a pre-diabetic phase, driven by high rice consumption and poor eating habits. I began with a 12-hour fast, hoping to regain control. But it wasn’t practical with my work schedule. Eventually, I let go of overtime shifts and made a bold move to take a new job working from home. That decision changed everything.

With more control over my day, I shifted to a 14-hour fast. I skipped breakfast and developed a habit of drinking black coffee blended with ghee. It gave me energy and focus. Slowly, I extended my fast to 16 hours, then 18. My meals were still rooted in South Indian cuisine, but I made conscious changes. I reduced rice, increased lentils, and used less oil for vegetables. I began experimenting with Thai and Malay vegan curries using tempeh and tofu. My hunger and cravings started to fade. By month four, fasting felt natural. I woke at 5:45 AM, walked 5 kilometers in a high-visibility jacket after my bullet coffee, worked from home, ate a high-protein, low-carb lunch, and walked another 3 to 5 kilometers after work. Netflix became my evening companion, and this routine carried me through seven months of solitude.

In January, I joined a running group. It was a cold, snow-filled month, but I ran in sub-zero temperatures. I came home with pink cheeks, teary eyes, and a refreshed body. By month eight and a half, I was doing OMAD, fasting for 22 hours with a 2-hour eating window. I started at 172 pounds at 5'4"", and by month nine, I was down to 129 pounds. It was more than just weight loss. It was a complete transformation. My energy soared, my mind cleared, and I felt in control of my body for the first time in years. Life slowly returned to normal, but the habits I built stayed with me. Even as I gained some weight back, I knew exactly what worked for me.

Now, I am starting again at 153 pounds. I am not chasing 129, but aiming for a strong and sustainable 135. This journey was never just about food or fasting. It was about reclaiming my life during a time when everything felt lost. It was about choosing discipline over despair and building a lifestyle that supports both physical and mental resilience.

1oqee09,3'ish months with 36x12,"40 pounds down, 267 -> 225, July 27th to today.

6' 2"", 41 year old male.

Not the first time I've lost a lot of weight, though last time I had 0 fitness and I lost it mostly by doing 90 minutes of cardio a day and eating *a little* less. I got real fit during that time. Did a ton of biking and backpacking.

This time, I'm very fit (albeit heavy) so my routine has been just eating less and using IF. Still do a ton of backpacking. Not as much biking, though I do get out when I can.

I do 36x12. Basically 6AM -> 6PM I can eat, then I don't eat again until 6AM two calendar days later.

I eat whatever I want, although I cut out booze (almost) entirely. Most days I'd start with a strong protein drink, that also has collagen, matcha, chia, cocoa, flax, PB powder, MCT oil. Sometimes milk, sometimes water, depending on convenience.

I'll often also have some eggs on homemade sourdough (got into baking around the same time, oops). I'll gladly eat pizza, pasta, cheese, peanut butter. Nothing is really off limits.

I otherwise try to limit carbs, but I'd bet they're still about 50% of my calories.

\--> I've found this is very easy for me to do. Sure I'm hungry *all the time*, but from a self discipline standpoint the consistency and repetition works well for me. I've associated the sensation of being hungry to the positive feeling of having lost weight at weight in. If my plan is to eat nothing in the day, it's easy for me to stick to that. If I'm allowed to eat a little bit in a day, I have a tendency to cheat. It's very easy for me to go to social events and just say no thanks (I try to let them know ahead of time so they don't have to prep anything for me) where before social events would ruin me as I'd always over-eat at them. I think mostly where this has worked for me is the habit of eating constantly has gone away. When I get bored, I don't go scavenging the pantry. Even on days where I'm allowed to eat, I often forget to, or don't respond to being hungry because I'm just used to it now. <--

I sleep better since I stopped snoring. I went from starting to outgrow XL shirts to looking good in my mediums again. I'm back to 32"" and ran out of notches on my favorite belt. My sleeping heart rate dips into the 30s. Resting heart rate 51 on average.

My achilles tendonitis has gone away.

Apple health has my cardio Vo2 max fitness back into above average.

Following an achilles tendon rupture injury, I am leaning towards listening to my body more, and that includes taking care of it by intermittent fasting, not eating refined sugar, drinking sugary drinks, reducing junk food intake, etc.

I’ve lost about 14kg of fat (by DEXA scan) and I’ve got about 20kg of fat left to lose before I hit 20% body fat. 
At my heaviest, I was working a very active job and lifting very heavy equipment at work, so I build A LOT of muscle (I’ve been consistently at 48kg of muscle since I started IF, according to my 5 monthly DEXA scans). Now that I’ve lost weight, this much muscle is really obvious on my frame and it is causing me a lot of mental distress/body dysmorphia. I do not need this much muscle and would like to lose around 7kg, which still puts me at 73% muscle at my goal weight. How can I lose some muscle mass while still staying healthy?

It made me wonder was IF actually helping, or just masking the same habits under a “discipline” label? Some days it felt amazing energy steady, cravings gone. Other days, the hunger hit like a truck and all I could think about was food.

What’s wild is how different it seems for everyone. Some people say fasting gave them mental clarity and better digestion. For me, it became this cycle of control, then rebound hunger.

1oordmi,Am I doing this the most effective way possible?,"Hi. I started intermittent fasting end of September with 16:8 (6:00pm-10:00am fast) and I’ve been consistent with it. I’ve gone from 302 to 288. I was getting around 2200 cals a day and working out every other day (sometimes skipping a workout) for 30 mins at a time on the elliptical or treadmill (speed walking). But I wasn’t making much progress so I recently lowered my calorie count to 1500 ish a day. Most of that is my breakfast and dinner but I have something small like a piece of a fruit and a protein bar for lunch at 2:00pm. For breakfast I have a cup of overnight oats with milk, a few table spoons of Greek yogurt vanilla flavour, four teaspoons of a seed blend, and some peanut butter. That runs me around 780 cals. Dinner is usually 400-800 cals depending on what mom makes (yes my mom cooks for me and I am an adult).

Is the 16:8 effective?
Should I be having something different for breakfast? Something lower calorie, higher protein? I really like my oats and I make it in a jar and shake it up and it’s lovely.
What about working out, should I be doing more? Everyday? 45mins? Resistance?

Now, the reason I ask is because for like two weeks I was stuck at 292. Hence lowering my calories. Then almost immediately I started to lose again.

Is there room to add more calories and still lose weight? 

Any advice?

1ooiudu,Started last week ..,"So this is kind of a funny one. Staring at 5’10”/315lbs … my plan was to start with a 18/6 and move slowly to OMAD with the help of GLP1s but something weird happened to my brain. I order my first pen, and decided to start my diet early to avoid side effects but when I made that decision to get the pen somehow something flipped in my brain and just decided I can do this without the jab. 

Kinda weird. Weight loss wise for me it helps to eat leans protein and veggies and cut out sugar and most traditional carbs. If I can do that I find my cravings go away. Only shit thing is that if you fall off the wagon then it’s a pretty crappy 2 days … which is why I was initially planning on using GLP1s. 

Anyways 5 days in and my body has swapped over to ketosis and feeling great! 

I’ve been reading posts here for a while so thank you for the tips. Will update on progress 
As it goes. Plan on doing another dexa scan in a couple months to see what the loss is coming from. 

Exercises wise I’ll be doing weights 3 times a week plus 13-15k steps walking my dog … and will be adding a Goruck

1oob9ja,Am I breaking my fast? 20/4,"I am currently 32 days in to 20/4 intermittent fasting. It is not my first round as my longest streak was 120 days last year. I just decided to jump back in again as if I hadn’t left. The first two days were the worst and by day three I was locked in. 

Last year after being a month in I was not hungry until around the time of my eating window. It was easy to ignore the little hunger I did feel from time to time, not to mention my job then was more demanding than what I am doing now. I fear it has something to do with what I am consuming in the morning.

I drink Mio energy in the morning to get my day going. It used to be coffee until it started to upset my stomach. I found the Mio to be much easier on my stomach and I would follow it up with some water to stay hydrated alongside the caffeine. From my understanding Mio Energy has 0 Calories and 0 sugar, though now I’m worried that the artificial sweetener is causing my body to react in some way that breaks my fast. I know little of nutrition, could it be possible I am ruining my fast with my Mio Energy consumption? Thank you for your time.

TL:DR - Is Mio Energy breaking my fast and causing hunger?

1oo9ufz,"My blood biomarker categories - Before, during, and after fasting","Hey folks! I wanted to share how my **blood biomarker categories changed** over the past 10 months - from Dec last year (before my 9- and 10-day water fasts) to last month (after complete refeeding).

I used InsideTracker’s biomarker categories, which combine 50+ markers into 10 health areas like Heart Health, Hormone Health, Inflammation and others. (I know some might say this categorization isn’t perfect, but it’s the best I’ve seen so far.) Each category gets a **0-100 score (100 = best)** based on how close each marker is to its ideal range. For example, Heart Health includes ApoB, TSH, hsCRP, triglycerides, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, and resting heart rate. 

In the chart, **the black line shows Dec 2024**, before my fasts, **the red line marks the end of my last 10-day fast** in Sep, and **the green line shows last month**, after a month of refeeding. As you can see, the red line reflects how the body feels during extended fasting - not exactly thrilled, since fasting is a stressor. 

Of course, this is **N=1 data**, and fasting (especially extended fasting) isn’t for everyone. But for me, it helped improve 8 out of 10 biomarker categories, so I just wanted to share my experience in case it’s helpful or interesting to others.",1762269445.0,5,6,intermittentfasting,weight_loss

One of the most helpful things to do was use a plate and not overload it with food. I began with only eating once per day, then eventually I ate one meal every two days. Making sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day. 

During this time I began going to the gym and did an hour of cardio per day which was either stairmaster, jogging, incline running and rowing.

This is what worked for me and I highly recommend it to everyone. Before you know it the weight just drops off.

1oo60pb,High Triglycerides,"Hello!

I am doing 20-24h fasting since September. I am doing it mainly to reduce visceral fat (but also improve overall health and want to keep it like that), and have lost 8 kgs (I am 1,92 height and 79 kgs now), so now I think I am spot on, but would like more muscle. I have started and doing one day walking-running, and next day some resistance exercise home. Very happy in general, more energy, no energy dips!

Last day went for a lipid test what i got was very high triglycerides level, around 260 mg/dl (Norm Range<150), which is far beyond normal. Previous day had my exercise afternoon and then had dinner around 10. Blood test was taken around 10 in morning. Doctor is also puzzled because previous triglyceride level some months ago was around 107.

Could it be due to ketosis or recent exercise while fasted? Anyone with similar issues? Maybe due to long fasts I need more fasting time before blood test?  I am thinking that due to one meal per day structure, my true fasted window maybe starts later than the normal 12 hours window which works for most people. Maybe I was not truly fasted and this was just a snapshot after eating.

1oo5x17,Because of course there's a sub for that! LOL,"Last weekend I found this sub and have been reading and looking and now I want to share with you guys. Y'all have about a year of me catching up incoming so if you don't wanna read here's the short version, I lost 60 pounds. There, thats the jist of the post.

Now for the long version:

Back in 2020. I had a heart attack and the young age of 37 (apparently shitty hearts run in the family). Until then I was a pretty skinny American... that is to say fat but still skinny by my peers standards (6ft 3in and 220 pounds). I'm not athletic so I didn't carry my weight all to well bit better than most (I didn't have a 'beer belly').

Anyway after the heart attack I started to pack on the pounds. Mostly from fear eating and fear of working my heart to hard.

Cut to last year November when my cardiologist tells me in not so nice language, ""Lowkeygeek, you're not going to see 45 at this rate! You are actively killing yourself and I'm not going to sugar coat it!""

I had scheduled both my primary care and cardiologist visits on the same day and an hour later I was talking with my GP. I told him with the heart guy said and GP nodded and said, ""there's nicer ways of saying that but yeah, Lowkeygeek you aren't doing so hot."" So we talked about how I could take off weight.

He suggested IF as his preferred choice as according to him its pretty much the original diet. So I went home with basically a mountain of printouts from him and lots of reading. When I say lots of reading it took me near a week to read and absorb everything he gave me.

My Healthcare has an app that let's me message my care team so over the course of a week of back and forth with my care team we settle in an overly aggressive caloric intake of 1100 cals/day with a 16:8 IF scheduled. My doctor couldnt stress enough just how aggressive it was and how much caution he had. Under ideal conditions he wants 2000 cals/day with an 14:10 then adjust as needed but nothing less than 1800cal/day.

But! And I cannot stress this enough, but! I WAS IN DIRE STRAIGHTS!!!! (PLEASE CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR DO NOT TRUST ONE GUY ON THE INTERNET)

Anyway my schedule worked out for me and I lost 60 pounds. I went in every 3 months for blood work and have had a complete 180° turn around in my health. This Friday I see my cardiologist (the Doom-sayer) and he'll get to see the results of his dire warning.

I'm down to 200 pounds, feel fantastic, and actually see a light at the end of my tunnel. I can go on walks with my dog, which we do twice weekly a 5km hike. And more importantly I can lift the steel bars at my work without panting and needing a break every 5 seconds.

So thats the end. I wanted to tell Y'all how I've done and just hope to hear your successes.

I'm also happy to answer any and all of your questions too. Cause I know my IF schedule was brutal and maybe a bit much. But know I had basically constant communication with my doctor the whole time. Also if you want I can give ya progress pics when I get home and on my computer.

Edit: forgot to add, at my worst I was 263.3 pounds, with a 46inch waist thats when the heart guy yelled at me. Now I'm 200 with a 38 inch waist, still 6ft 3in.",1762259452.0,43,6,intermittentfasting,weight_loss

Pretty much every health problem I have will get better if I lose 50 lbs, but I've been unsuccessful for the past 5 years on any other method. 

It's not that I can't medically change my schedule but that I know myself and I'm not going to be able to hold out all morning if that's the END of my fast and I'm absolutely starving. This way, I can just go to bed early to avoid eating. Also, it means I'm not distracted and brain fogged with hunger for work - and I have long COVID and menopause symptoms which also affect my concentration so I really am trying to do everything possible to be my most productive. I also prefer to take pain meds in the morning so I'm not distracted by my chronic pain, and I have to have some food with those because they rip my stomach up. So it's about being able to manage my work life - which I depend on obviously - more than my social life. But not having a social life still sucks.

I am looking for advice on some apps for intermittent fasting to help me get started. 

I did 2 years ago for a few months via an App. I managed to get down to 1 meal a day. However, the App changed and it's now bloated with settings that make it too complicated. 

I have ADHD, so to get started I need an app to help me focus on it (fixate on the timer) and avoid the continual grazing. Unfortunately, I tried many mobile apps and I find they are all too complicated or bloated with stuff and they make me loose interest right away. I found they are too hard to set up to start with, hard to change the times to match what you actually did, hard to change your goal as you progress, or/and hard to easily see where you are. 

I am looking for something that's very simple. 

I found intermittent fasting to be amazing for me, not just because of the things people normally mention, but I found that eating fewer meals and (eventually) only 1 meal a day helped me make sure what I ate was healthy so I ended up eating soo much better than I do now.

1oml0p5,"How a 9-day fast changed my blood sugar response - White rice, maple syrup and bananas","Hey folks! I thought this might be interesting to share here. I’ve been tracking my blood sugar closely since I tend to get pretty big spikes after meals. So, I measured my glucose response using a continuous glucose monitor (Dexcom G7) to the same foods before a 9-day water fast, then 1 month and 5 months after. Here are my results

🍚 **White Rice (100g, 360 cal)**

* Pre-fast (Mar 2024): **274 mg/dL**
* 1 month post-fast (Mar 2025): **200 mg/dL**
* 5 months later (Jul 2025): **207 mg/dL**

🍁 **Maple Syrup (37g, 100 cal)**

* Pre-fast (May 2024): **233 mg/dL**
* 1 month post-fast (Mar 2025): **118 mg/dL**
* 5 months later (Jul 2025): **163 mg/dL**

🍌 **Bananas (2 bananas)**

* Pre-fast (Dec 2023): **242 mg/dL**
* Right after fast (Feb 2025): **118 mg/dL**
* 5 months later (Jul 2025): **187 mg/dL**

So, right after fasting my glucose response improved dramatically. Five months later, some of that benefit faded - but my peaks are still lower than before the fast. That actually matches what research shows, and it’s cool to see it confirmed in my own data. And just for context - my A1c is 5.3%, so I’m considered metabolically healthy.

Then I discovered keto and intermittent fasting.  Keto changed my life but the 20 pounds remained. Daily intermittent fasting (16:8  to 20:4) helped but still didn't create the change I wanted.

Somehow I've progressed to the point that I can fast for a day or more and be comfortable doing it.  I even forget I'm doing it.  And guess what ?  The pounds are falling off.  I have complete control of my body weight now.  And it is so simple - just don't eat !  Who needs Ozempic ?

This is life changing.  I now have complete control of my body weight, almost effortlessly.  No diets, no rigorous exercise regimes, just fasting.

Something I forgot to mention is that I have a lot of muscle mass and I'm active.  My daily average calorie burn is 3000 calories.  On hiking or cycling days I can burn 5000 calories.  Source: my Garmin FR965 watch.

Had two cancers right in a row, was forced into chemical menopause, and gained about 17 pounds. I am not trying to lose a bunch of weight, would just like to get back to where I was. I started IF in early July, 16/8 as a base, sometimes 18, up to 22 hrs fasting, but not often. The first two weeks were very hard, then it got easier. My sweet spot is 17/7. I have probably lost about 8 pounds and would like to lose another five or ten. But the last week, it's suddenly become much harder to not eat.

1olrjhv,Is it time to step away from the scale?,"TL;DR: I think I'm hyperfixated on my weight and I'm having a hard time enjoying the other benefits of fasting. Should I change my attitude and practices around weighing in?

Hi all, I'm 44F, SW 213, CW 202-203, GW 160. Earlier in the year, I was pretty debilitated with my gallbladder going bad and lost almost 20 lbs (in January I weighed 231 lbs) while waiting for surgery. I looked and felt pretty bad, but after having the gallbladder out I feel great and decided to try to get back to the healthy BMI range (125-163 lbs for my height) instead of gaining back all my weight.

I've been IF for almost 7 full weeks. Started 14:10, and over that time I've ramped up to fasting 18-22 hours a day. Cut out snacking and all junk food, save the occasional square of extra-dark chocolate. I eat a piece of fruit and a couple servings of vegetables every day, meat/seafood, full fat dairy. Probably still too many carbs. I don't count anything, but I'm certain I'm eating less calories-- I eat similar meals to what I've always eaten, but without the nearly constant snacking and daily candy/cookies/cakes/chips. I mostly ""fast clean"" but I do drink an herbal tea or unsweetened flavored water during my fast maybe a few times a week. I saw both my primary doctor and gyno this week and they're both supportive of me continuing IF. 

I've been weighing myself daily, logging my weights in a spreadsheet, and calculating the weekly average. Obviously, I have lost weight. 10-11 lbs in 7 weeks is nothing to sneeze at, particularly in the thick of perimenopause, which started for me around age 39. But I get frustrated when I don't see the scale move. Last week, we had Oktoberfest at our church, and I fasted all day, then ate ALL the food except dessert (only because I was too full) and drank 2 good dark beers. I normally drink very rarely and I was LIT. Overnight I went from 201.4 lbs to 203.8. All this week, my weight has stayed up in the 202-203 range. I am so frustrated. 

But I also increased my exercise this week, going from 20-30 minutes of light cardio daily to 30+ minutes of moderate cardio plus lifting pretty heavy 3 days this week, and light cardio on the other days. Years ago, I did Crossfit but gave it up due to cost. This week I joined a gym, and quickly figured out I can make myself a workout plan based on what I learned back then, for about 10% of the cost. Here come the questions: 

1. Since I am doing harder exercise in an attempt to not just lose weight, but to shape my body to look good, will that slow down my loss on the scale? I'm OK if it does, I just don't want to attribute my heavier weight to that if it's not a potential cause. I don't think I've gained a pound of muscle in just a few workouts, but could this small gain be from inflammation?

2. What are other people doing as far as weight tracking? Weighing daily, weekly, monthly? How hung up do you get on the scale number? Do you have a philosophy around weight tracking and how meaningful it is? I've been weighing daily since about February, so it's a big habit change for me to stop, but I don't want to give myself unneeded stress. My clothes are fitting different, particularly my shirts are getting much looser, which is amazing. I look at myself in the mirror and feel really happy, even in a week where I've gained weight.

3. For those who have been doing this long term, is there a point where you became less fixated on results? I'm not super hung up about eating/not eating. I just stop eating after dinner and then set the timer for 18 hours. After 18 hours, I decide if I want to eat or keep fasting. The fasting is the easy part. The hard part is that I'm so annoyed by my weight on the scale that I spend the day wondering how I can force my weight down by the next morning.",1762013009.0,10,21,intermittentfasting,weight_loss

1okwjml,The rate of autophagy during fasting - Rough estimates,"Hey folks! I see questions about autophagy, so I researched this topic and wanted to share some numbers you might find interesting. Keep in mind that autophagy isn’t directly measurable in humans yet - these data come from animal and cell studies. So, take these as rough estimates, not precise human numbers.

As you might know, autophagy is the body’s internal cleanup system. It removes damaged cells and recycles their components, supporting longevity, metabolic balance, brain health, and lower inflammation. First, there is basal autophagy. Even in a fed state, our cells recycle about 1-2% of cytoplasmic material per hour, or roughly 25-50% per day. That includes worn-out mitochondria, misfolded proteins, and oxidized lipids.

Then, during fasting, things speed up. As insulin and amino acid levels fall, autophagy ramps up. Extending a regular 12-hour overnight fast to 16 hours (famous 16:8 IF) can roughly double or triple activity. And, finally, with short and extended fasts, autophagy may rise 5-10x depending on tissue type - meaning 5-10% of cytoplasmic material could be recycled per hour. That’s enough to renew most of a cell’s internal components within a day or two.

Hopefully, this helps show how fasting intensity and duration - whether IF, OMAD, ADF, or extended - progressively enhance the body’s natural repair process.",1761921958.0,30,2,intermittentfasting,weight_loss

It took 2 years before I noticed that being on it made me gain weight despite no real change in my diet and exercise.

The last 6 months I gained back 6kg and have been see-saw-ing losing and gaining 2kg in the last 2.
